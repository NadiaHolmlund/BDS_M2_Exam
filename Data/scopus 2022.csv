Grenoble Alpes, Inria, CNRS, Grenoble INP, LIG, Grenoble, France","Network slice management and, more generally, resource orchestration should be fully automated in 6G networks, as envisioned by the ETSI ENI. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and context-aware policies are certainly major options to move in this direction and to adapt service delivery to changing user needs, environmental conditions and business objectives. In this paper, we step towards this objective by addressing the problem of optimal placement of dynamic virtual networks through a self-adaptive learning-based strategy. These constantly evolving networks present, however, several challenges, mainly due to their stochastic nature, and the high dimensionality of the state and the action spaces. This curse of dimensionality requires, indeed, a broader exploration, which is not always compatible with a real-time execution in an operational network. Thus, we propose DQMC, a new strategy for virtual network embedding in mobile networks combining a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategy, namely a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo (MC). As learning is costly in time and computing resources, and sensitive to changes in the network, we suggest a control-theory-based techniques to dynamically leverage exploration in DQMC. This leads to fast, efficient, and sober learning compared to a Monte Carlo-based strategy. This also ensures a reliable solution even in the case of a change in the requests’ sizes or a node's failure, showing promising perspectives for solutions combining control-theory and machine learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","5G slicing; Control theory; Deep reinforcement learning; Monte Carlo; Virtual network embedding","5G mobile communication systems; Computation theory; Deep learning; E-learning; Monte Carlo methods; Network embeddings; Robust control; Stochastic systems; 5g slicing; Context-aware policies; Deep reinforcement learning; Exploration strategies; Fully automated; Monte carlo; Reinforcement learnings; Robust control theory; Service delivery; Virtual network embedding; Reinforcement learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138489176

Raw data is collected by people in business, science, medicine, academia, and government, and there are various commercial programmes that process the data to provide general and specific purpose knowledge discovery. “Turn Data into Knowledge” is an important goal in knowledge discovery and data mining. Data mining is the process of examining data previously stored in databases in order to solve problems. The technique of detecting patterns in vast data repositories is known as data mining. In order to complete a data mining task, effective exploratory strategies are always required. Association rules, correlations, sequential patterns, classification, clustering, and other data mining techniques are only a few examples. Every technique has its own value, which is determined by the application area and challenges for which it is used. The objectives of this study, as stated in the synopsis, are met using association rule mining methodology. The original motivation for association rules mining was the problem of supermarket transaction data. The problem with supermarket transaction data is that it is used to investigate client purchasing habits. The frequency with which things have been purchased together is described by association rules. For instance, the association rule “cool drink=> chips (80%)"" implies that 80% of customers who purchase cool drink also purchase chips. Such criteria can be beneficial in making judgments about store layout, product pricing, and marketing, among other things. © 2022 The Authors","Data mining; Datasets; Machine learning algorithms; Pattern mining",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139035002

Hence, this study is aimed at achieving timely, anticipated and effective response throughout the cycle of a disaster, extreme weather and emergency operations management with the help of advanced technologies. This study proposes a novel, evidence-based framework (4-AIDE) that highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based collaborative platforms in disaster, extreme weather and emergency situations. A qualitative approach underpinned by organizational information processing theory (OIPT) is employed to design, develop and conduct semi-structured interviews with 33 respondents having experience in AI and cloud computing industries during emergency and extreme weather situations. For analysing the collected data, axial, open and selective coding is used that further develop themes, propositions and an evidence-based framework. The study findings indicate that AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms offer a structured and logical approach to enable two-way, algorithm-based communication to collect, analyse and design effective management strategies for disaster and extreme weather situations. Managers of public systems or businesses can collect and analyse data to predict possible outcomes and take necessary actions in an extreme weather situation. Communities and societies can be more resilient by transmitting and receiving data to AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms. These actions can also help policymakers identify critical pockets and guide administration for their necessary preparation for unexpected, extreme weather, and emergency events. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Cloud technologies; Disaster management; Extreme weather; Organizational information processing theory","Computation theory; Disaster prevention; Emergency services; Cloud based collaborative; Cloud technologies; Collaborative platform; Disaster management; Emergency operations; Extreme weather; Information processing theories; Organizational information processing; Organizational information processing theory; Weather operations; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138481195

Although today it is almost inevitable for any business to adopt some level of digital transformation to strengthen their competitiveness, this transition in the agri-food sector could be more complex, given its characteristics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to analyse worldwide the perceptions of new digital technologies in the agri-food sector expressed within social media platforms, identifying the differences that may exist between them regarding its objectives and social acceptance. METHODS: This paper examines the information regarding digital transformation process in the agri-food sector disseminated worldwide on Twitter. For that purpose, Twitter API is used to gather tweets and descriptive and content analyses, including a sentiment analysis, are performed using R and MAXQDA software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that the digitalization of the agri-food sector is broadly discussed within Twitter. Different actors participate in these information flows, being companies and digital solution providers the most active users and academics and governmental institutions the most visible. Artificial Intelligence was the most mentioned technology, that together with the Internet of Things, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, was related to improving production efficiencies, crop yield, or cost reduction. In the case of Blockchain Technology, it was closer to food supply chain actors, such as distribution companies and marketers. However, all these technologies are connected to the concept of sustainability. The sentiment analysis showed a generally positive tone, indicating social acceptance regarding the starting phase of the adoption of these technologies. The study also identified differences among countries, pointing to a stronger level of engagement with these technologies in developed regions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was seen as a chance to boost the digital transformation in the sector all over the world. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that data harvested from Twitter provide useful insight into perceptions of digital transformation and different digital technologies in the agri-food value chain across different countries. Information that could be useful for researchers, but also for agricultural firms and policymakers. © 2022 The Authors","Agri-food sector; Agriculture 4.0; Data mining; Digital transformation; Twitter","agricultural technology; business development; COVID-19; data mining; exploration; food supply; Internet; social media; software; trend analysis",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138371040

This study aimed to evaluate whether the use of business intelligence (BI) for real-time data visualization is associated with an improvement in lung protective strategy and adjunctive therapy. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted on patients with ARDS admitted between September 2020 and June 2021 at two intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary referral hospital in Taiwan. BI was imported for data visualization and integration to assist in clinical decision in one of the ICUs. The primary outcomes were the implementation of low tidal volume ventilation (defined as tidal volume/predicted body weight ≤ 8 mL/kg) within 24 h from ARDS onset. The secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital mortality rates. Results: Among the 1201 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 148 (12.3%) fulfilled the ARDS criteria, with 86 patients in the BI-assisted group and 62 patients in the standard-of-care (SOC) group. Disease severity was similar between the two groups. The application of low tidal volume ventilation strategy was significantly improved in the BI-assisted group compared with that in the SOC group (79.1% vs. 61.3%, p = 0.018). Despite their ARDS and disease severity, the BI-assisted group tended to achieve low tidal volume ventilation. The ICU and hospital mortality were lower in the BI-assisted group. Conclusions: The use of real-time visualization system for data-driven decision support was associated with significantly improved compliance to low tidal volume ventilation strategy, which enhanced the outcomes of patients with ARDS in the ICU. © 2022, The Author(s).","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Business intelligence; Data-driven decision support; Intensive care unit; Lung protective strategy; Real-time visualization","adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; body weight; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; data visualization; decision support system; disease severity; evaluation study; female; hospital admission; hospital mortality; human; intelligence; intensive care unit; lung ventilation; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; observational study; patient care; prediction; retrospective study; Taiwan; tertiary care center; tidal volume; adverse event; artificial ventilation; lung; respiratory distress syndrome; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Lung; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Retrospective Studies; Tidal Volume",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136231866

In the process of special coating construction, a comprehensive analysis of equipment usage in different compartments is carried out, and a compartment energy consumption analysis model based on combined weighting and Gray Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation is proposed. The model uses factors such as energy consumption, hours, and number of devices as evaluation indicators. Based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the gray correlation coefficients and comprehensive weights were weighted to obtain the final comprehensive evaluation results of each planning scheme, and then compare them to determine the optimal scheme.

The concept of success has many subjective facets, and it needs to be evaluated to reach other higher objectives, such as improving support systems for entrepreneurs. The usual pre-existing focuses for the evaluation of business performance are analysed and adapted. Based on a real case, the most relevant variables for detecting success are studied and an algorithmic process (based on decision trees) is established to ascertain whether an entrepreneur has achieved success. The data refers to entrepreneurs from Andalusia, the European region with the highest unemployment rates and where support for entrepreneurship is on the agenda of all political parties. The model specifies a minimal set of variables to evaluate success in each case. Subsequently, a simple set of 29 questions is also offered, serving to classify most entrepreneurs (over 98% of 2221 individuals in the case analysed) by their level of success. An objective procedure to measure the success of entrepreneurs is given. Such method is based on artificial intelligence and on three focuses: positioning, expectations and evolution. Both the variables used in this case and the 29 questions necessary to classify the entrepreneurs by their level of success are explicitly provided. © 2022, The Author(s).","Achievement; Assessment; Classification; Decision trees; Entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125490907

The case study of cleaning urban areas in the city of Split with electric cleaners is used to evaluate the multi-agent system. The model consists of three main entities: Electric Vehicle, Charging Station and Depot. The electric vehicle is defined more generally to ensure the application and reusability of the model in different business and research domains. The routing algorithms of the multi-agent system are defined with artificial intelligence utilization models. The utilization models predict the use of parking lots and charging stations, based on which the routing algorithms navigate the electric vehicles in the space. The utilization models use the CatBoost machine learning method and a contextually enriched dataset that uses point-of-interest data as context. The multi-agent platform for contextual routing of electric vehicles is used for validation and evaluation of multi-agent models and comparative analysis of routing algorithms under defined contextual conditions.

Specifically, more research is needed that explores which consumers are more likely to support AI use in marketing as well as why this occurs to develop targeted marketing campaigns toward these consumers. Through three studies, our research addresses these gaps by testing the role of religiosity on AI evaluations. Study 1 shows that religiosity positively influences perceptions of AI in marketing, which is mediated by greater trust in AI. Study 2 primes religiosity to demonstrate the causality of the effects, showing that consumers exposed to a religiosity prime more positively evaluate companies and their employees when AI is used. Study 3 then better confirms the underlying mechanisms of these effects using a virtual conversational agent context by showing that higher religiosity consumers are more trusting of the unseen, which leads to greater trust of a company, and ultimately positively influences evaluations of companies using AI. We contribute to belief congruence theory in identifying the role of trust (specifically trust in the unseen related to AI) in the belief-behavior relationship.

Performance appraisal capabilities are activities that use available information to improve business processes and achieve company goals. Knowledge information entered into companies, on the one hand, is effective in learning people and, on the other hand, is used in management decisions. This study aims to improve these organizational performances by using Business intelligence (BI) and Artificial intelligence (AI) on Data mining systems (DMS) in privately held companies. This descriptive survey study is based on the purpose of applied and quantitative research. The statistical population includes managers of privately held companies. These companies use BI and AI in their data mining systems. The results revealed that BI capabilities & reliability affect performance capabilities. Further, Performance evaluation capabilities (PEC) impact competitive advantage; Since the BI capabilities are related to BI reliability, thus, Business intelligence infrastructure (BII) impresses BI reliability. Path coefficient between the two variables of integration of BII on BI capabilities is β = 0.389. Moreover, the T-statistic between these two variables is t = 5.768. Path coefficient between the two variables of BI capabilities over reliability business intelligence is β = 0.158. Moreover, the T-statistic between these two variables is t = 1.967.

Fourth Generation Management arises as a systems-based approach for managing contemporary businesses before the advent of Industry 4.0 and during low awareness of the Circular Economy. While 4th Generation Management provides value to business by considering several resources, stakeholders, and interactions, making businesses customer-oriented, it fails to address the sustainability issue for contemporary businesses in the current context of Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and Stakeholders. Indeed, it fails to make businesses more contemporary (i.e., more open and sustainable) to adapt to their context. Moreover, in the literature, there is no work discussing how Sustainability, Industry 4.0, Circular Economy, Competitiveness, and diverse Stakeholders as contemporary issues are accounted for in business management. The main aim of this study is to propose a Re-engineered 4th Generation Management as a systems-based approach, enabling today's business to be oriented toward customer and sustainability. We have reviewed 181 articles published between 2005 and 2022 from Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases to pursue such a goal. The novelty of this work relies on presenting a systems-based approach, which is best suited for sustainable businesses in the context of Industry 4.0 digitalization technologies (e.g., Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, and Big data analytics), Circular Economy, Stakeholders, and Competitiveness.

Successful firm marketing is to offer the right product to the right person at the right time. To market the product to the customer successfully, it is needed to segment the customer by finding their behavioral patterns. The customer behaviors and their purchasing patterns are used to generate profit for the company. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers based on commonalities. Developing an efficient AI-based customer segmentation to improve digital marketing growth is a challenging task. In this paper, an unsupervised deep learning model called a Self-organizing map with an Improved social spider optimization approach has been used for efficient customer segmentation. The customer data are analyzed by a feature engineering process using a swarm intelligence model called Modified social spider optimization to select the behavioral features of the customer. Then, the customers are clustered using Self Organizing neural network (SONN). Based on the clusters, the customers are classified using the Deep neural network (DNN) model. The experimental results prove the performance of the proposed model with high clustering and segmentation capability to improve the business profit in marketing. © 2022","Classification; Clustering; Customer segmentation; Deep neural network; Digital marketing; Self-organizing map; Social spider optimization","Commerce; Conformal mapping; E-learning; Learning systems; Profitability; Sales; Self organizing maps; Swarm intelligence; Automated systems; Based modelling; Clusterings; Customers segmentations; Digital marketing; Model method; Optimisations; Self-organizing-maps; Smart System; Social spider optimization; Deep neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137175602

However, continued innovation in Computer Science, specifically in sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as natural language processing (NLP), has created significant value for businesses through helpful data-driven features. To this end, we propose a platform utilizing AI-driven tools to help build an effective business-to-business (B2B) platform. The proposed platform aims to automate much of the market research which goes into selecting products and platform users during times of distress while still providing an intuitive e-commerce interface. There are three primary novel components to this platform. The first of these components is the Buyer’s Club (BC), which allows customers to pool resources to purchase bulk orders at a reduced cost. The second component is an automated system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect trending disaster news topics. Disaster topic detection can be applied to inform buyers and suppliers on adapting to changing market conditions and has been shown to match closely with Google Trends data. The third component is a regulation matching system, using a custom data set to help inform customers when purchasing products. Such guidance is necessary to comply with a regulatory environment that will be irregular for the foreseeable future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Data mining; Data retrieval; Mobile; Natural language processing; User interface",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136640876

Additionally, they also involve scaffolding risks, that lead to a high accident rate in most electricity companies. The recent emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is gradually leveraged to avoid such risks. However, UAVs usually face Global Positioning System instability issues especially in the distant or harsh infrastructure areas. This requires frequent manual UAV control and calibration by electricity operators. In this article, we propose a new method for automating the UAV infrastructure inspection procedure. The method uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify electricity infrastructures and the associated assets, as well for the real-time detection of infrastructure faults. Additionally, using 5G Network Function Virtualization technologies, such as end-to-end network slicing, combined with edge computing, significant latency and GPS accuracy improvements are realized during the inspection. We apply the method for the inspection of a Hydroelectric Power Plant of the Public Power Corporation. The experiments illustrate significant benefits in latency, GPS accuracy, fault discovery rate and accident reduction. Such benefits provide real-time response to infrastructure faults that supports business continuity and increase customer satisfaction. © 2022 The Authors","5G; Electrical fault detection; Multi-access edge computing; Network security monitoring; Network slicing; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Antennas; Customer satisfaction; Edge computing; Fault detection; Global positioning system; Hydroelectric power; Network security; System stability; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 5g; Aerial vehicle; Edge computing; Electrical fault detections; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Network security monitoring; Network slicing; Networks security; Security monitoring; Unmanned aerial vehicle; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136452994

Today, there is growing interest in using UGDF data as an alternative to conventional financial data in building consumer credit models—UGDF models. Unfortunately, we also observe a hype where the models’ business deployability is reduced to simplistic technical metrics, namely, the model's prediction accuracy. This study argues that this is a misleading oversimplification of the financial sector's business realities as it ignores vital dimensions such as the model's economic viability. Therefore, we develop a framework for evaluating the business deployability of UGDF models for consumer credit using a design science research methodology.

A total of 537 Jeju-do residents and potential visitors from the mainland were analyzed by conducting a partial least squares (PLS)- structural equation modeling (SEM) and one-group pretest–posttest design through a survey after observing a video clip on blockchain implementation on YouTube. The empirical analysis results showed the effect of blockchain trust transparency on the performance and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions were found to be the most influential in blockchain technology acceptance. Following a video experiment introducing blockchain implementation as a currency for Jeju tourism, a significant positive change towards the implementation of blockchain was observed.

They have proven capable of tasks such as prediction, learning and adaptation based on experience and can be used in virtually any scientific application, ranging from biomedical, robotic, to business decision applications, and others. However, the lack of domain knowledge for a particular application can make feature extraction ineffective or even unattainable. Furthermore, even in the presence of pre-processed datasets, the iterative process of optimizing Machine Learning parameters, which do not translate from one domain to another, maybe difficult for inexperienced practitioners. To address these issues, we present in this paper a Vectorized Automated ML Pre-processIng and post-pRocEssing framework, approximately named (VAMPIRE), which implements feature extraction algorithms capable of converting large time-series recordings into datasets. Also, it introduces a new concept, the Activation Engine, which is attached to the output of a Multi Layer Perceptron and extracts the optimal threshold to apply binary classification. Moreover, a tree-based algorithm is used to achieve multi-class classification using the Activation Engine. Furthermore, the internet of things gives rise to new applications such as remote sensing and communications, so consequently applying Machine Learning to improve operation accuracy, latency, and reliability is beneficial in such systems. Therefore, all classifications in this paper were performed on the edge in order to reach high accuracy with limited resources. Moreover, forecasts were applied on three unrelated biomedical datasets, and on two other pre-processed urban and activity detection datasets. Features were extracted when required, and training and testing were performed on the Raspberry Pi remotely, where high accuracy and inference speed were achieved in every experiment. Additionally, the board remained competitive in terms of power consumption when compared with a laptop which was optimized using a Graphical Processing Unit. © 2022, The Author(s).","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification; Edge computing; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Multi Layer Perceptron; Post-processing; Pre-processing; Signal processing","Chemical activation; Classification (of information); Edge computing; Engines; Extraction; Iterative methods; Large dataset; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Trees (mathematics); Edge computing; Features extraction; High-accuracy; Human abilities; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Multilayers perceptrons; Post-processing; Pre-processing; Signal-processing; Feature extraction",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132421893

Building on existing research in this area, this paper aims to define these concepts from a decision-making perspective and elaborates on the influences of these emerging technologies on human analytical and intuitive decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first provide a holistic understanding of important drivers of digital transformation. The authors then conceptualize the impact that analytics tools built on artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have on intuitive and analytical human decision processes in organizations. Findings: The authors discuss similarities and differences between machine learning and two human decision processes, namely, analysis and intuition. While it is difficult to jump to any conclusions about the future of machine learning, human decision-makers seem to continue to monopolize the majority of intuitive decision tasks, which will help them keep the upper hand (vis-à-vis machines), at least in the near future. Research limitations/implications: The work contributes to research on rational (analytical) and intuitive processes of decision-making at the individual, group and organization levels by theorizing about the way these processes are influenced by advanced AI algorithms such as machine learning. Practical implications: Decisions are building blocks of organizational success. Therefore, a better understanding of the way human decision processes can be impacted by advanced technologies will prepare managers to better use these technologies and make better decisions. By clarifying the boundaries/overlaps among concepts such as AI, machine learning and big data, the authors contribute to their successful adoption by business practitioners. Social implications: The work suggests that human decision-makers will not be replaced by machines if they continue to invest in what they do best: critical thinking, intuitive analysis and creative problem-solving. Originality/value: The work elaborates on important drivers of digital transformation from a decision-making perspective and discusses their practical implications for managers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Big data analytics cycle; Decision-making; Intuition; Machine learning; Rationality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115787231

It may be assisted by medical dictionaries, books, resources on the Internet, past personal experiences, or recognising symptoms or medical signs of a condition that a family member previously had. A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application. Identify the right opportunity to develop an AI-driven chatbot. You can build a chatbot using established frameworks or development (non-coding) platforms depending on the features your start-up requires. Understand the goals of your business and your customer early on in the process. An AI chatbot makes a decision by leveraging pre-existing knowledge and one that it acquires continuously. To maximise the ability of AI chatbots to improve service, save money, and increase engagement, businesses and organisations need to understand how these programs work and what they can do. In this guide, you'll get a crash course on talking bots, including the technology behind them, how they have transformed marketing and customer service, and how you can start putting them to work. Users can assuredly benefit from chatbots if they can diagnose several kinds of illness and render the required data.

However, its successful implementation poses one of the most relevant challenges to the Industry 4.0. According to recent surveys, 80%–87% of data science projects never make it to production. Regardless of the low deployment success rate, more than 75% of investors are maintaining or increasing their investments in artificial intelligence (AI). To help quality decision-makers improve the current situation, this paper aims to review Process Monitoring for Quality (PMQ), a Quality 4.0 initiative, along with its practical and managerial implications. Furthermore, a real case study is presented to demonstrate its application. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed Quality 4.0 initiative improves conventional quality control methods by monitoring a process and detecting defective items in real time. Defect detection is formulated as a binary classification problem. Using the same path of Six Sigma define, measure, analyze, improve, control, Quality 4.0-based innovation is guided by Identify, Acsensorize, Discover, Learn, Predict, Redesign and Relearn (IADLPR2) – an ad hoc seven-step problem-solving approach. Findings: The IADLPR2 approach has the ability to identify and solve engineering intractable problems using AI. This is especially intriguing because numerous quality-driven manufacturing decision-makers consistently cite difficulties in developing a business vision for this technology. Practical implications: From the proposed method, quality-driven decision-makers will learn how to launch a Quality 4.0 initiative, while quality-driven engineers will learn how to systematically solve intractable problems through AI. Originality/value: An anthology of the own projects enables the presentation of a comprehensive Quality 4.0 initiative and reports the approach’s first case study IADLPR2. Each of the steps is used to solve a real General Motors’ case study. © 2022, Carlos Alberto Escobar, Daniela Macias, Megan McGovern, Marcela Hernandez-de-Menendez and Ruben Morales-Menendez.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Quality control; Smart manufacturing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129859949

Extending the dynamic capability concepts of sensing, seizing and transforming, this research investigates practices by which SMEs successfully adapt over time. Design/methodology/approach: A comparative case study method was employed using a purposive sample of SMEs, consisting of three American firms and one Canadian firm. Findings: Three sets of organizational practices, termed adaptive practices, that underlie dynamic capabilities for successful adaptation were identified: (1) continuous learning and process improvement, (2) leveraging reciprocal relationships and (3) communicating effectively. Research limitations/implications: The selected cases are from two countries in North America. Using a qualitative, inductive process, the authors are able to identify patterns of actions within various organizations; however, they are not able to establish causality. Practical implications: This study provides practical guidance for leaders to take action to improve their SME's dynamic capabilities for adaptation through creating coherent bundles of specified adaptive practices. Social implications: Better understanding of how SMEs successfully adapt to high uncertainty and business viability threats can result in multidimensional (e.g. financial, emotional) and multi-level (individual, family, community), positive outcomes for societal stakeholders. Originality/value: The findings of this study build on the literature of dynamic capabilities and organizational practices and provide a practical foundation for effective adaptation, labeled as adaptive practices. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive practices; Dynamic capabilities; SME; Strategic adaptation; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122793015

This is caused by the excessive and often irrational consumption of textile products. Moreover, most companies in this industry operate in the linear model and despite the incentives to transition to a circular economy model, companies in developing countries face difficulties in finding strategies that are both circular and do not pose risks to their businesses. Thus, whether due to the lack of skills or the structure needed, many companies choose to outsource circular economy strategies to manage fashion waste. However, outsourcing circular decisions are underestimated and arbitrarily taken without any prior analysis of whether these strategies may or may not be outsourced. This can hinder companies' transition to a circular economy due to the lack of circularity of other companies they cooperate with. Hence, the aim of this study was to propose a novel multi-criteria decision model for sorting circular strategies into those that can be outsourced or not in adopters' and incumbents’ circular business models supported by a decision support system. Moreover, we compared them in real case studies to identify the main differences between their outsourcing decisions and their impacts on cleaner production for fashion waste management. This comparison resulted in insights that may support circular businesses worldwide to make consistent outsourcing decisions to fashion waste management, which is rarely explored in the literature with empirical evidence. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Circular business models; Developing countries; Fashion industry; Outsourcing; Waste management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Outsourcing; Pollution control; Textile industry; Textiles; Waste management; Business models; Circular business model; Circular economy; Circular strategies; Decision modeling; Fashion industry; Linear modeling; Multicriteria decision; Outsourcing decisions; Textile products; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135924879

The tools and methodologies proposed by the supply-chain risk management (SCRM) literature are mostly based on experts’ judgments, their knowledge, and past data. The expert evaluation-based approach could be partly or fully replaced by AI solutions, increasing objectivity, impartiality, and impersonality, reducing sources of human mistakes, biases, and inefficiencies in SCRM. However, the transition from BA to AI in SCRM is not a self-contained process; though attractive as a vision, it is not straightforward as a management or implementation process. The purpose of this research is to explore and define the conceptual grounds for transitioning from BA to AI in SCRM. The conceptual SCRM structure, its AI suitability, and implementation terms are defined theoretically based on a literature review. A single, in-depth business case study is employed to explore the theoretically defined terms of AI-based SCRM implementation. The proposed conceptual AI-suitable SCRM structure is defined by five principal building blocks: risk events, risk-event indicators, data-processing rules and algorithms, analytical techniques, and risk event probability forecasts. The study concludes that the business environment meets AI-based SCRM-implementation terms of data existence and access. Since data on risk events and negative outcomes are limited for machine learning, experts’ experience and knowledge might be utilised to build initial rules and data-processing algorithms for AI. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; business analytics; supply-chain risk management",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140024666

It is a hot research field, resulting from the mutual infiltration and interweaving of phonetics, psychology, digital signal processing, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. At present, speech emotion recognition has been widely used in the fields of intelligent signal processing, smart medical care, business intelligence, assistant lie detection, criminal investigation, the service industry, self-driving cars, voice assistants of smartphones, and human psychoanalysis, etc. In the background of artificial intelligence, the realization of smooth communication between people and machines has become the goal pursued by people. Mel spectrograms is a common method used in speech emotion recognition, focusing on the low-frequency part of speech. In contrast, the inverse Mel (IMel) spectrogram, which focuses on the high-frequency part, is proposed to comprehensively analyze emotions. Because the convolutional neural network-stacked sparse autoencoder (CNN-SSAE) can extract deep optimized features, the Mel-IMel dual-channel complementary structure is proposed. In the first channel, a CNN is used to extract the low-frequency information of the Mel spectrogram. The other channel extracts the high-frequency information of the IMel spectrogram. This information is transmitted into an SSAE to reduce the number of dimensions, and obtain the optimized information. Experimental results show that the highest recognition rates achieved on the EMO-DB, SAVEE, and RAVDESS datasets were 94.79%, 88.96%, and 83.18%, respectively. The conclusions are that the recognition rate of the two spectrograms was higher than that of each of the single spectrograms, which proves that the two spectrograms are complementary. The SSAE followed the CNN to get the optimized information, and the recognition rate was further improved, which proves the effectiveness of the CNN-SSAE network. © 2022 by the authors.","deep learning; IMel spectrogram; Mel spectrogram; speech emotion recognition",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139967529

The backbone of the purposed framework is a hybrid mechanism that comprises business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) to support 360-degree organization-wide analysis. BI modeling gives descriptive and diagnostic analysis via interactive reports with quick ad hoc analysis which can be performed by executives and managers. ML modeling predicts the performance and highlights the potential customers, products, and time intervals. The whole mechanism is resource-efficient and automated once it binds with the operational data pipeline and presented results in a highly efficient manner. Data analysis is far more efficient when it is applied to the right data at the right time and presents the insights to the right stakeholders in a friendly, usable environment. The results are beneficial to viewing the past, current, and future performance with self-explanatory graphical interpretation. In the proposed system, a clear performance view is possible by utilizing the sales transaction data. By exploring the hidden patterns of sales facts, the impact of the business dimensions is evaluated and presented on a dynamically filtered dashboard. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; B2B; B2C; business intelligence; data warehousing; digital revolution; sustainable business model","artificial intelligence; business; digital image; hybrid; machine learning; retailing",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139959726

Solar energy is one of the most important renewable energies, and the investment of businesses and governments is increasing every year. AI is used to solve the most important problems found in PV systems, such as the tracking of the Max Power Point of the PV modules, the forecasting of the energy produced by the PV system, the estimation of the parameters of the equivalent model of PV modules or the detection of faults found in PV modules or cells. AI techniques perform better than classical approaches, even though they have some limitations such as the amount of data and the high computation times needed for performing the training. Research is still being conducted in order to solve these problems and find techniques with better performance. This article analyzes the most relevant scientific works that use artificial intelligence to deal with the key PV problems by searching terms related with artificial intelligence and photovoltaic systems in the most important academic research databases. The number of publications shows that this field is of great interest to researchers. The findings also show that these kinds of algorithms really have helped to solve these issues or to improve the previous solutions in terms of efficiency or accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; faults detection; forecasting; MPPT; parameter estimation; PV",,Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139951445

Under the impact of “economic globalization”, the competition of the Chinese domestic market continues to intensify, and Chinese enterprises are facing enormous pressure for survival and development. Among them, there are many cases of poor business operation caused by financial crisis which have directly put these companies in trouble, even causing them to go bankrupt. Therefore, it is very practical to establish a scientific data model to analyze and predict the financial data of enterprises. It can not only monitor the financial status of the enterprise in real time, but also play an effective financial early warning role. This research focuses on using the combined forecasting method to establish a more comprehensive financial early warning model to solve the related financial crisis forecasting problem. Specifically, two different forecasting methods are first adopted in this study to conduct financial early warning research. The first is time series forecasting. It is a dynamic data processing statistical method, which is often used in forecasting research in the business field. The second is the BP neural network algorithm (referred to as BP), which is an error back-propagation learning algorithm, which is often used in the field of artificial intelligence. Then, the prediction error values of the two methods are compared and they are applied to the combined prediction method. Finally, a new error prediction formula is obtained. The result shows that the BP method provides the best performance over others, while the combinational forecasting method offers better performance than any single method. © 2022 by the authors.","back propagation; combined forecasting model; financial early warning; time series",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139930397

In the context of the hospitality business, resilient infrastructure based on digital technologies is critical for gaining the best customer feedback on providing quality service. Digital technology has already proved to enhance hospitality services with intelligent decisions through real-time data. In the previous studies, the significance of digital technologies in the hotel sector has been extended in numerous theoretical and empirical studies, yet there is a lack of research that provides a discussion on feedback systems in hospitality with digital technologies applications. With the motivation from the above aspects, this study intends to present the importance and application of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and big data implementation in customer quality and satisfaction. Moreover, we have discussed each technology´s significance and application for realizing digital-based customer quality and satisfaction. It has been identified that the AI-based system collects the input data from different common websites and compares it with a different algorithm using a neural network. According to the findings of this study, AI and personnel quality of service have an impact on customer pleasure and loyalty.

Applying artificial intelligence algorithms to the SCM system can realize the visualization, automation, and intelligent management of all links in the supply chain. This can effectively help enterprises reduce operating costs and improve their ability to respond to market demands, thereby increasing overall operational efficiency. An effective member selection method is an important basis for smooth dynamic supply chain operation. To address the problem of high numbers of decision attributes and low numbers of data samples for decision analysis, this paper proposes a dynamic supply chain member selection algorithm based on conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs). To ensure that classification performance will not be reduced, the member classification method on the chain can successfully reduce the data dimension and complexity in the classification process. Furthermore, machine learning is used for analyzing and predicting purchase and inventory links in the supply chain. For the vehicle scheduling module, the path is reasonably planned to improve the operation efficiency.

Although aerial inspection of transmission lines is a well-researched topic, there is still space for research papers and solutions that focus on shared control, landing, and experimental evaluation of the solutions. This kind of system has the capabilities to acquire and process information about its surrounding. By employing automatic UAVs embedded with artificial intelligence, industries, business and researchers can significantly improve their visual-based inspection routines, bringing safety to the user and processing reliable information. Therefore, this research work proposes a strategy to both detect and track power transmission lines and a method to allow assistive control during UAV landing. Both methods were evaluated in simulated and real-world scenarios. Regarding the detection and tracking strategies, the outcomes suggested that the proposed system is capable of correctly identifying power transmission lines and navigating above them, even in the presence of cluttered backgrounds.

In this paper, we analyze two innovation strategies: one is manufacturer innovation in which the manufacturer implements innovation; and the other is platform innovation in which the electronic retailer implements innovation. Moreover, we propose two types of e-commerce business structures which are widely adopted in reality: one is reselling structure in which the electronic retailer buys products from the manufacturer and resells them to consumers; the other is agency selling structure in which the manufacturer directly sells products to consumers through the platform by paying a commission fee. A theoretical model is developed to compare the above four scenarios. Our results show that under reselling structure, when platform innovation is as efficient as manufacturer innovation, manufacturer innovation achieves higher profit for both supply chain players, which implies that policy makers can encourage manufacturer innovation by providing incentive mechanisms. Whereas under agency selling, the impact of innovation efficiency on firms’ profit depends on the platform's commission rate. Moreover, the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from platform innovation than the electronic retailer, and the electronic retailer is better off under agency selling. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electronic retailing; Game theory; Supply chain management; Technology innovation","artificial intelligence; electronic commerce; game theory; innovation; manufacturing; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138528771

In 2010, the Indian Railway (IR) proposed a “Special Freight Train Operator” scheme to build an IR stake in freight transportation in high-capacity rakes. IR allowed freight train operators (FTOs) and manufacturers to invest in wagons and take benefit of the largest rail network to move selected goods to their end customers. In the absence of an optimized support system, FTOs are often confronted with the decision of rolling stock (rake) scheduling, rake assignment, and rescheduling on a real-time basis. Today, most of the rakes have GPS devices. Thus, railway train management systems readily provide data to create a dynamic optimization model for FTOs using IoT-based real-time information. We first formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that aims at revenue maximization incorporating optimal rake assignment and optimal rake scheduling. Furthermore, to incorporate real-time GPS data, we propose an “IoT enabled real-time rake schedular-reschedular heuristic” for rescheduling. The computational investigations exhibit that the proposed heuristic performs effectively both in terms of run time and the quality of the solution. These models will help FTOs smoothly run day-to-day businesses and lead to better revenue realization in the calendar month by increasing the number of trips. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Heuristics; Indian Railways; Internet of things (IoT); Mathematical optimization; Mixed integer linear programming; Real-time Rake rescheduling; Special Freight Train Operator","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Economics; Freight transportation; Information management; Integer programming; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Real time systems; Scheduling; Freight trains; Heuristic; Indian railway; Integer Linear Programming; Internet of thing; Mathematical optimizations; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Real- time; Real-time rake rescheduling; Special freight train operator; Train operator; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135925724

This article summarizes theoretical and empirical contributions on how these technologies affect global value chains (GVCs). We argue that the leading paradigms that analyse global production – the GVC framework and the related global production networks (GPNs) approach – are in need of some ‘technological uprading’ themselves. The GVC/GPN approaches acknowledge that technology is constitutive for the emergence of geographically fragmented production, but rarely address directly how technological change affects interfirm relations. The authors provide a framework that acknowledges the key role of technology while situating digital tools and systems in their social embeddedness, that is the role of human agency and institutions in shaping their development and impact. A research agenda is outlined focusing on three topics: the varieties of digitalization approaches in different world regions, the role of data as a specific form of intangible resource and the role of platform business models for industrial ecosystems.

In Europe, national programs for sharing of this data will be crucial for the development, testing, and validation of machine learning–enabled tools supporting clinical decision-making. Here, the Swiss Digital Pathology Consortium (SDiPath) discusses the creation of a Swiss Digital Pathology Infrastructure (SDPI), which aims to develop a unified national DP network bringing together the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) with Swiss university hospitals and subsequent inclusion of cantonal and private institutions. This effort builds on existing developments for the national implementation of structured pathology reporting. Opening this national infrastructure and data to international researchers in a sequential rollout phase can enable the large-scale integration of health data and pooling of resources for research purposes and clinical trials. Therefore, the concept of a SDPI directly synergizes with the priorities of the European Commission communication on the digital transformation of healthcare on an international level, and with the aims of the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) for advancing research and innovation in the digitalization domain. SDPI directly addresses the needs of existing national and international research programs in neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases by providing unprecedented access to well-curated clinicopathological datasets for the development and implementation of novel integrative methods for analysis of clinical outcomes and treatment response. In conclusion, a SDPI would facilitate and strengthen inter-institutional collaboration in technology, clinical development, business and research at a national and international scale, promoting improved patient care via precision medicine. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Biomedical research; Image analysis; Pathology; Precision medicine","Europe; human; machine learning; medical research; personalized medicine; Switzerland; Biomedical Research; Europe; Humans; Machine Learning; Precision Medicine; Switzerland",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133883549

As a primary AI tool, chatbots have seen increasing use by companies to support customer service. An understanding of how chatbots are used is essential for improving customer service. Based on the relevant literature, this study examined the impacts of chatbot-enabled agility (namely, internal and external chatbot agility) on customer service performance and explored the antecedents from the perspective of information technology use (both routine and innovative use). We collected data from 294 U.S. marketing employees from various industries, using a survey for the assessment of our research model. The results showed that both routine and innovative use of chatbots were positively related to internal and external agility. In particular, the innovative use of chatbots plays an important role in creating business agility. Moreover, internal and external agility are positively related to customer service performance. Through a close look at chatbots and their use, our study provides insight into the role of AI in creating business agility. Practically speaking, this study suggests that both the routine and the innovative use of chatbots should be encouraged to create agility and develop business sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agility; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Customer service; Dynamic capabilities; Innovative use; Routine use","Sales; Agility; Artificial intelligence tools; Business leaders; Chatbots; Customer-service; Dynamics capability; Information technology use; Innovative use; Routine use; Service performance; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131788486

However, AI technology capabilities are not enough—companies need to understand how the technology can be commercialized through appropriate AI business model innovation. When emerging technologies are introduced, business-model concepts often need to be significantly altered. This is necessary to fully capitalize on disruptive technologies because it is just as important to innovate the business model as it is to build advanced technology solutions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explain how AI providers align value-creation and value-capture dimensions in order to develop commercially viable AI business models. To fulfill our stated purpose, this study has adopted an inductive and exploratory single case-study approach centered on a market-leading provider of AI-related services. The findings are consolidated into a process framework that explicitly illustrates the key activities that companies need to perform concerning value creation and value capture for AI business model innovation and commercialization. The framework explains that AI providers need to follow three phases—namely, identifying prerequisites for AI value creation, matching value capture mechanisms, and developing AI business model offer. We also find that AI providers need to test and develop multiple AI business models and operate them simultaneously to ensure commercial success. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence (AI); Business models; Process framework; Value capture; Value creation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123265329

This reality leads to a paradigm shift in which web-based cyber-physical environments will shape future learning environments. Thus, learning becomes ubiquitous, and schools assume new roles with systemic changes in communication, administration and management, becoming learning organisations. The use of technologies aligned with pedagogical strategies and new methodologies must lead to more-personalised systems. In this article, a comprehensive definition of smart schools is proposed. Smart schools must be endowed with integral management systems, inclusive, sustainable, and adopt new learning methodologies and advances from Industry 4.0 in an efficient way. Despite this conception and because research, government policies and business projects are not always in line with research, there is a need for deeper knowledge of how schools are approaching their upcoming transformation. To illuminate this purpose, in this study 37 principals from primary and secondary schools in Catalonia were interviewed. Thematic analysis focusing on technological and pedagogical innovations, management systems, inclusion, and sustainability identified some analogies with related research, pointing out that schools are far from implementing advanced technologies. Inclusion is the most-respected element thanks to the existing government regulation. Sustainability is hardly considered because of a lack of economic resources, but several schools consider themselves green schools and exhibit environmental practices. Conclusions are drawn to show that, although schools are not yet prepared to cope with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, its impact relies on the technology’s level of maturity and ease of use, as well as stakeholders as policymakers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Fourth industrial revolution; Industry 4.0; Learning environment; Smart classroom; Smart school",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118635188

The argument draws on the institutionalist approach in philosophy and business ethics defending a 'division of moral labor' between governments and the private sector (Rawls 2001; Scheffler and Munoz-Dardé 2005). The goal and main contribution of this article is to explain how this approach can provide ethical guidelines to the AI industry and to highlight the limits of self-regulation. In what follows, I discuss three institutionalist claims. First, principles of AI ethics should be validated through legitimate democratic processes. Second, compliance with these principles should be secured in a stable way. Third, their implementation in practice should be as efficient as possible. If we accept these claims, there are good reasons to conclude that, in many cases, governments implementing hard regulation are in principle (if not yet in practice) the best instruments to secure an ethical development of AI systems. Where adequate regulation exists, firms should respect the law. But when regulation does not yet exist, helping governments build adequate regulation should be businesses' ethical priority, not self-regulation. © 2021 Thomas Ferretti, published by De Gruyter.","artificial intelligence; business ethics; division of moral labor; political CSR; regulation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112267578

Digitization of all processes that once took days is now just a click away. In recent years, with the rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT), the integration of financial information systems with new information technologies has led to changes in business operations. Technology adoption is not new to the financial industry, but digital innovation has brought major improvements in system connectivity, customer experience, and newly created and usable data. Financial and technological innovations are multiplying: crowd funding services, mutual loan sites, online banking, mobile wallets, e-commerce. All this is only the beginning of the path that Moroccan banks and financial companies must travel to obtain the main advantages and opportunities that initiate the development of the fintech segment. However, the rapid development of new financial technologies corresponds to the rapid growth of the risks that accompany them. Therefore, an important step in the development of fintech is the identification of the risks caused by their appearance. Recently, digital finance encompasses a multitude of new financial products, financial activities, finance-related software and new forms of communication and interaction with customers, provided by innovative financial companies and financial service providers. Digital innovation in financial services is changing the way financial resources can be accessed, distributed and managed.

Large companies can take advantage of a deluge of data, typically withhold from the research community due to privacy or business sensitivity concerns, and this is particularly true for networking data. Therefore, the lack of high quality data is often recognized as one of the main factors currently limiting networking research from fully leveraging AI methodologies potential. Following numerous requests we received from the scientific community, we release AppClassNet, a commercial-grade dataset for benchmarking traffic classification and management methodologies. AppClassNet is significantly larger than the datasets generally available to the academic community in terms of both the number of samples and classes, and reaches scales similar to the popular ImageNet dataset commonly used in computer vision literature. To avoid leaking user- and business-sensitive information, we opportunely anonymized the dataset, while empirically showing that it still represents a relevant benchmark for algorithmic research. In this paper, we describe the public dataset and our anonymization process. We hope that AppClassNet can be instrumental for other researchers to address more complex commercial-grade problems in the broad field of traffic classification and management.

In this work, we present the results of an exploratory case study with 20 construction workers in a small Austrian company about their knowledge of and attitudes toward AI. Our results show that construction workers' understanding of AI as a concept is rather superficial, diffuse, and vague, often linked to physical and tangible entities such as robots, and often based on inappropriate sources of information which can lead to misconceptions about AI and AI anxiety.

Meeting performance targets such as higher data rate transmission, lower end-to-end latency, higher capacity, lower cost, and satisfied Quality of Experience (QoE) for delivered services is the key for the success of 5G and 6G networks. Within these performance targets and associated enabling technologies, QoE and the overall management of multimedia services is the one which has been less well addressed for 5G in the past. This paper provides a comprehensive and ground-breaking discussion regarding QoE management in the context of future softwarized 5G/6G networks. We introduce a generalized QoE provisioning ecosystem for emerging multimedia streaming services in softwarized 5G/6G and beyond networks. We explore potential network softwarization and communication technologies that will enable the end-user's QoE in 5G/6G. We further provide promising use case scenarios regarding (a) QoE-driven management of multimedia services over multi-access cloud/edge softwarized and virtualized 5G networks, (b) QoE monitoring for large traffic variations in business, residential and public areas in 5G networks, along with a Machine Learning (ML)-based softwarized controller for QoE provisioning over 5G/6G networks. We build on the achievements of 5G networks to provide the roadmap towards the development of 6G and beyond networks in terms of requirements, use case scenarios and service classes. We also present potential technologies that will be dominant through 2025–2030 in shaping the vision of 6G and beyond networks including (a) self-driving 3D network architecture, (b) network management, automation and orchestration, and (c) pervasive artificial intelligence. Moreover, we provide challenges and research directions in 6G and beyond wireless communication systems. The paper provides the first roadmap towards the management, orchestration and monitoring of multimedia 3D services in 6G and beyond networks. The comprehensive goal of this paper is to encourage researchers from the industry and academia to work together towards the realization of softwarized 6G and beyond networks while tackling the critical research challenges regarding the management of emerging 3D multimedia services and applications.

Since the business of the enterprises is completely reliant upon the customers, and further, in today's fast-paced business environment, retaining the existing customers and attracting new potential consumers is a tough challenge for each enterprise. With tremendous significance, improvements in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms aid in performing efficient analysis of customer pattern. Moreover, in most circumstances, the real-time datasets acquired contain irrelevant, noisy, and correlated factors, which makes it difficult for the ML model to extract the underlying information about the data. So, in order to overcome the problem of real-time customer datasets and perform efficient analysis, the Multi-Level Attribute Selection (MLAS) approach is proposed in this work as a preprocessing mechanism to alleviate the extraneous attributes and select the optimum variable subset to model with the Base Classifier. The proposed approach MLAS composed of three phrases that are used that are used to choose the right set of variables. In first step, consumer dataset related to the problem is collected, and then, second step is to perform data transformation. In third step, FS is performed to choose the right set of variables. Furthermore, the variable sets captured are applied with different machine learning models to perform effective insight about customer behaviour. In this work, two different ML models are studied: Naive Bayes, and K-NN algorithms. Lastly, experimental results obtained using the MLAS approach and without the MLAS approach are evaluated and compared using several performance metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure. © 2022, Engg Journals Publications.

The accuracy of models based on artificial intelligence and statistical models has long been discussed. By combining the advantages of both groups, hybrid models have emerged. These models show high accuracy. Moreover, the question remains whether data in a dynamically changing economy (for example, in a pandemic period) have changed the possibilities of using these models. The changing economy will continue to be an important element in demand forecasting in the years to come. In business, where the concept of just in time already proves to be insufficient, it is necessary to open new research questions in the field of demand forecasting. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to apply hybrid models to bicycle sales e-shop data with a comparison of accuracy models in the pre-pandemic period and in the pandemic period. The paper examines the hypothesis that the pandemic period has changed the accuracy of hybrid models in comparison with statistical models and models based on artificial neural networks. Models: In this study, hybrid models will be used, namely the Theta model and the new forecastHybrid, compared to the statistical models ETS, ARIMA, and models based on artificial neural networks. They will be applied to the data of the e-shop with the cycle assortment in the period from 1.1. 2019 to 5.10 2021. Whereas the period will be divided into two parts, pre pandemic, i.e. until 1 March 2020 and pandemic after that date. The accuracy evaluation will be based on the RMSE, MAE, and ACF1 indicators. Findings & value added: In this study, we have concluded that the prediction of the Hybrid model was the most accurate in both periods. The study can thus provide a scientific basis for any other dynamic changes that may occur in demand forecasting in the future. In other periods when there will be volatile demand, it is essential to choose models in which accuracy will decrease the least. Therefore, this study provides guidance for the use of methods in future periods as well. The stated results are likely to be valid even in an international comparison. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).","demand forecasting; forecastHybrid; neural networks; statistic model",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139453919

Waiting for materials is one of the eight big losses in lean manufacturing. The availability of materials in the right places is of prime importance in industrial stores, sales centre, and material service after the Principle of Automation. In the procurement of materials, office automation plays an important role in making materials available for manufacturing at the right time. Though Material requirement Planning and Manufacturing requirement Planning were automated with computers, they must be fine-tuned with technological advancements. Office automation tools are preferred in this research. Service innovation is key to sustainable strategic advantage differentiation across the company and markets. A manual and conceptual task in management planning plays a most significant role in the basic principles of office automation. Recent advances in automation include using digital inventions not only for office tasks but also for automated office functions such as managing labour resources, availability of materials, categories of materials, consumption patent of materials, cost of materials, the procurement cost of materials from various supplies etc. As a result, many automations, typing letters, visual transformation, and updated technologies are encrypted and communicated in virtual form. However, conceptual experimentation efforts that inquire about these improvements were dispersed throughout a broad span of academic research, contributing to an absence of consistency in major results and applications. The main objective of this article is to explore the various approaches in Materials supply and service automation with the help of advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with its additional branches.

SMEs, whose resilience and adaptability had already been tested during the previous period of the global financial crisis, were called upon to face a new emergency. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to investigate the evolution of digital transformation in small and medium enterprises during the pandemic of COVID-19 and (ii) to highlight the main research trends of digital transformation in the post-pandemic era. To approach these issues, a bibliometric analysis based on R package was conducted and examined 765 articles that were published in the timespan of 2014–2022. In the current bibliometric analysis, a range of indicators were applied, such as co-citation analysis of both sources and institutions, the annual scientific production, country collaboration map, world tree map and Multiple Correspondence Analysis. The bibliometric software of Biblioshiny and VOSviewer were used as the main tools to process the data and contributed to the visualization of the results. Findings of the research show that emerging technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning and 3D printing have started integrating SMEs in their business models. In addition, the technology–organization–environment framework (TOE) has emerged as a niche theme in the research field of digital transformation of SMEs. The above reveals the willingness and the effort of SMEs to adapt to the new circumstances created by the pandemic of COVID-19, by transforming their business models from conventional to digital one. The social media model is also highlighted, as a new product development of SMEs during the crisis of pandemic of COVID-19. The intention to adopt both TOE business model and social media are significantly influenced by emerging technologies and can raise the awareness of government to support SMEs in this effort. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; digital transformation; eco-effectiveness; emerging technologies; SMEs; strategic path; technology–organization–environment framework","bibliography; COVID-19; government; incentive; machine learning; product development; small and medium-sized enterprise; social media; software; strategic approach; visualization",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138740682

As an initial sample, 150 owners/top managers from 150 SMEs (one informant from each) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were chosen. A stratified random sample was employed for this cross-sectional study. Applying structural equation modeling, the combined influence of internal and external variables influencing the intention to adopt BT is explored. Results show that: (1) knowledge of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (2) the relevant advantage of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (3) perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence has a positive and significant effect on the adoption of blockchain technology; (4) risk-taking behavior mediates the relationship between knowledge of artificial intelligence and adoption of blockchain technology; (5) risk-taking behavior does not mediate the relationship between relevant advantage and perceived ease of use of artificial intelligence with the adoption of blockchain technology. The current study is one of the few empirical investigations relating to SMEs using artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies for business operations. The study’s limitations are the small sample size and use of a single informant. However, the findings on the adoption of blockchain technology have applications for boosting the competitiveness of SMEs. This study’s originality stems from two factors: the novelty of blockchain technology and its potential to upend SMEs’ conventional mode of operation. It highlights the need to consider the key variables affecting SMEs’ adoption of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; Bangladesh; blockchain technology; risk-taking behavior; SMEs; survey",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138702382

In the past, business negotiations, profiling, seminars, shopping, and agreements were in-person but today everything is almost digitalized. Objectives: The study aims to examine how the Internet of things (IoTs) connects text-object as part of NLP and AI responding to human needs. Also, how precipitated changes in the business environment and modern applications such as NLP and AI embedded with IoTs services have changed business settings. Problem statement: As communication takes lead in the business environment, companies have developed sophisticated applications of NLP that take human desires and fulfill them instantly with the help of text, phone calls, smart records, and chatbots. The ease of communication and interaction has shown a greater influence on customer choice, desires, and needs. Modern service providers now use email, text, phone calls, smart records, and virtual assistants as first contact points for almost all of their dealings, customer inquiries, and most preferred trading channels. Method: The study uses text content as part of NLP and AI to demonstrate how companies capture customers’ insight and how they use IoTs to influence customers’ reactions, responses, and engagement with enterprise management in Industry 4.0. The “Behavior-oriented drive and influential function of IoTs on Customers in Industry 4.0” concept was used in this study to determine the influence of Industry 4.0 on customers. Results: The result indicates the least score of 12 out of 15 grades for all the measurements on a behavior-oriented drive and influential function of IoTs on customers. Conclusion: The study concluded that NLP and AI are the preferred system for enterprise management in the era of Industry 4.0 to understand customers’ demands and achieve customer satisfaction. Therefore, NLP and AI techniques are a necessity to attain business goals. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; enterprise management; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; natural language processing",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138655093

In order to develop and maintain profitable businesses, traders need accurate forecasts concerning their future sales, a very difficult task considering that these are influenced by a wide variety of factors. This paper proposes a novel e-commerce sales forecasting method that dynamically builds a Directed Acyclic Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) for Deep Learning architecture. This will allow for long-term, fine-grained forecasts of daily sales revenue, refined up to the level of product categories. The developed forecasting method provides the e-commerce store owner an accurate forecasting tool for predicting the sales of each category of products for up to three months ahead. The method offers a high degree of scalability and generalization capability due to the dynamically incremental way in which the constituent elements of the DAGNN’s architecture are obtained. In addition, the proposed method achieves an efficient use of data by combining the numerous advantages of its constituent layers, registering very good performance metrics and processing times. The proposed method can be generalized and applied to forecast the sales for up to three months ahead in the case of other e-commerce stores, including large e-commerce businesses. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM); convolutional neural network (CNN); directed acyclic graph (DAG); e-commerce",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138617587

Moreover, the latest research in entrepreneurship and general management justifies that the performance results of specific innovation strategies are usually influenced by dynamic capabilities. However, there is little empirical research on the linkage of open innovation, digital servitization, and micro-foundations of digital dynamic capabilities that affect alliance performance. The emerging literature on open innovation provides partial insight into the micro-foundations of digital dynamic capabilities. Based on it, from a dynamic capability perspective, this paper constructs a conceptual model of research including coupled open innovation of collaborative partners, alliance’s formation phases, and dynamic digital capabilities and their micro-foundations which impact alliance performance in grocery retail. The paper aims to provide an overarching view of the digital servitization process of grocery retailers and unpack the micro-foundations of the digital transformation of their business models to sustain advantages. Thus, the paper contributes to the research on open innovation, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and dynamic capabilities and provides two theoretical propositions. Then, having employed two illustrative case studies, this paper empirically tests theoretical propositions and justifies the role of coupled open innovation strategies for digital servitization and its micro-foundations. © 2022 by the author.","artificial intelligence; blockchain; digital servitization; dynamic capabilities; open innovation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138617439

This can be viewed as utilizing AI/ML to improve the customer journey experience. Reflecting on this, the main question to be addressed is: how can retailers utilize big data through the implementation of AI/ML to improve the efficiency of their marketing operations so that customers feel safe buying online? To answer this question, we conducted a systematic literature review and posed several subquestions that resulted in insights into why marketers need to pay specific attention to AI/ML capability. We explain how different AI/ML tools/functionalities can be related to different stages of the AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action) model, which in turn helps retailers to recognize potential opportunities as well as increase consumer confidence. We outline how digital myopia can be reduced by focusing on human inputs. Although challenges still exist, it is clear that retailers need to identify the boundaries in terms of AI/ML’s ability to enhance the company’s business model. © 2022 by the authors.","AIDA model; analytics; artificial intelligence; digital myopia; machine learning","Commerce; E-learning; Ophthalmology; Sales; Action modeling; Analytic; Artificial intelligence learning; Awareness model; Digital myopia; Machine-learning; Marketing operations; Online retails; Retail operations; Systematic literature review; Machine learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138493150

The ECS 2019 survey data were used to train an artificial neural network optimized using an imperialist competitive algorithm (ANN-ICA) to forecast business performance and employee wellbeing. In order to assess the correctness of the model, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r), and determination coefficient (R2) have been employed. The mean values of the performance criteria for the impact of internal and external factors on firm performance were 1.06, 0.002, 0.041, 0.9, and 0.83, and the value of the performance metrics for the impact of internal and external factors on employee wellbeing were 0.84, 0.0019, 0.0319, 0.83, and 0.71 (respectively, for MAPE, MSE, RMSE, r, and R2). The great performance of the ANN-ICA model is indicated by low values of MAPE, MSE, and RMSE, as well as high values of r and R2.

A key challenge is to develop mechanisms that allow companies to adapt to a globalized competitive environment. In this regard, projects and their management represent an opportunity for greater flexibility. This work presents a model developed to quantify dynamic absorption, understood as the ability to identify the value of new external knowledge, absorb it as internal knowledge and apply it to serve business purposes. The measured indicator is adapted to a dynamic organization environment and provides a project with the ability to interact with and monitor variables. For modeling, variables observed across 148 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), belonging to Colombian organizations, were collected using questionnaires and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine analysis dimensions, and subsets of dynamic absorptive capacity as latent variables from this information. The dynamic absorptive capacity measurement model (PM4AC) describes a normalized fit index (NFI), comparative fit index (CFI) and RMSEA of 0.935, 0.986 and 0.042, correspondingly. The contribution of this model is designed to improve and make available a new framework of business sustainability leadership, using the PM4AC tool. Finally, the objective of this study is to provide a model developed to quantify the dynamic absorption capacity for SMES.

The benefit of those data sets is often realized by domain experts applying specialist workflows to drive exploration, appraisal, and production decisions. However, the siloed nature of the industry's workflows often results in knowledge being stranded in specialist applications, which prevents the value from being shared with a wider team to build upon and drive more informed business decisions.

The overall objective of these efforts is to unlock the value of data by liberating knowledge from specialist silos and empower end users to apply best-in-class tools, workflows, or artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms to solve complex subsurface problems. This paper focuses on the practical considerations of implementing subsurface digital transformation and the challenges of providing high-quality curated data to end users. A case study demonstrates delivering a digital core database, integrating it with corporate well-log data stored in OSDU, and making it available through a common platform to enable easy end-user access to unlock the value of the data in driving more accurate decisions in the field. © 2022 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Cloud computing; Predictive analytics; Rock physics; Seismic; Well-log interpretation","Digital storage; Learning algorithms; Metadata; Petroleum prospecting; Well logging; Cloud-computing; End-users; Log interpretation; Roadmap; Rock physics; Seismic; Subsurface data; Well logs; Well-log interpretation; Work-flows; Predictive analytics; adoption behavior; prediction; rock property; subsurface flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137662880

A cloud model was innovatively applied to calculate similarities, and overcome subjective characterization of proposed values in negotiations. Additionally, two social factors, i.e., emotion and familiarity, were identified in negotiations, the Web-Fechner law was applied to model an agent's generation of emotion, and a familiarity function was constructed to measure the level of familiarity between negotiating agents. Finally, a stage model for agent-based emotional negotiation which integrates similarity, emotion, and familiarity was established.

In the previous New Product Development (NPD) process, CRs and CIs often need to be corrected through market surveys and questionnaires. To acquire the corrected data from experienced experts without user and designer cognitive bias is very laborious and more subjective. Under the situation of key information shortage for business developers and NPD efficiency & accuracy cannot be guaranteed, online reviews provided a good source for data analysis to enhance the market competition. This study integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Apriori algorithm, interval grey number, and Quality Function Deployment(QFD) techniques to propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation-Interval Grey Number Quality Function Deployment (LDA-IGQFD) method, which can use text mining and analysis methods to obtain objective information about CRs and CIs contained in users’ online reviews, transformed them into data and input into Interval Grey Number Quality Function Deployment (IGQFD) to drive product development. LDA-IGQFD can help product developers identify CRs and Engineering Characteristics (ECs) important information and provide suggestions for product development.

In the search for an appropriate strategic response, firms are currently engaging in a large variety of AI projects. However, recent studies suggest that many companies are falling short in creating tangible business value through AI. As the current scientific body of knowledge lacks empirically-grounded research studies for explaining this phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of machine learning (ML) in 29 different companies. Through an inductive qualitative analysis, we uncover three broad types and five subtypes of ML value creation mechanisms, identify necessary but not sufficient conditions for successfully leveraging them, and observe that organizations, in their efforts to create value, dynamically shift from one ML value creation mechanism to another by reconfiguring their ML applications (i.e., the shifting practice). We synthesize these findings into a process model of ML value creation, which illustrates how organizations engage in (resource) orchestration by shifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and business conditions change. Our model provides an alternative explanation for the current high failure rate of ML projects. © 2022 The Authors","AI strategy; Artificial intelligence (AI); Augmentation; Automation; Interview study; Knowledge creation; machine learning (ML); Value creation mechanisms","Electric grounding; Failure analysis; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence strategy; Augmentation; Interview study; Knowledge creations; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Process-models; Value creation; Value creation mechanisms; Machine learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134657563

One of the areas that can benefit from this progress is dynamic scheduling, which can improve production efficiency by tracking resource availability, job changes, and user commands. Challenges include setting triggers through the simultaneous integration of information from cloud-based enterprise databases and operational sources in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This paper proposes an integrated Information Technology - Operational Technology solution to support dynamic scheduling and rescheduling operations in a personalized production environment. It presents an implementation to a real-world application: an analytical quality control laboratory in the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting integration of intelligent sensors and business events in a fog computing architecture allows the generation of rescheduling triggers to specific online events. This paper focus on the definition of the online events affecting the operations and the cloud-fog-edge IIoT architecture used to support the implementation, and on the rescheduling triggers. The optimized reschedule of the use case shows that moving the computation closer to the cloud improves the CPU run time for larger instances. However, the combined CPU run time with the data exchange and querying introduces a non-negligible communication delay for smaller instances. In situations where fast scheduling solutions are required, fog computing near the edge is the best approach. On the other hand, for larger-size instances, moving the computation closer to the cloud is the recommended approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber-Physical Production Systems; Dynamic Scheduling; Fog Computing; Industrial IoT; Real-Time Rescheduling Events","Artificial intelligence; Cyber Physical System; Decision support systems; Electronic data interchange; Energy efficiency; Fog; Integration; Internet of things; Memory architecture; Production efficiency; Real time systems; Scheduling; Smart sensors; Cloud-computing; Cybe-physical production system; Cyber physicals; Dynamic scheduling; Industrial IoT; Production system; Real-time rescheduling; Real-time rescheduling event; Runtimes; Technology advancement; Fog computing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134596173

While heated regulatory debates about online platforms and AI are currently ongoing, we can look to existing horizontal norms, especially concerning the fairness of standard terms, which can serve as a benchmark against which to assess business-to-consumer practices in light of European Union law. We argue that such an assessment can to a certain extent be automated; we thus present an AI system for the automatic detection of unfair terms in business-to-consumer contracts, a system developed as part of the CLAUDETTE project. On the basis of the dataset prepared in this project, we lay out the landscape of contract terms used in different digital consumer markets and theorize their categories, with a focus on five categories of clauses concerning (i) the limitation of liability, (ii) unilateral changes to the contract and/or service, (iii) unilateral termination of the contract, (iv) content removal, and (v) arbitration. In so doing, the paper provides empirical support for the broader claim that AI systems for the automated analysis of textual documents can offer valuable insights into the practices of online vendors and can also provide valuable help in their legal qualification.

Advanced computer vision issues like image processing, object recognition, and biometric authentication can benefit from using deep learning methods. As smart devices and facilities advance rapidly, current networks such as 4 G and the forthcoming 5 G networks may not adapt to the rapidly increasing demand. Classification of images, object classification, and facial recognition software are some of the most difficult computer vision problems that can be solved using deep learning methods. As a new paradigm for 6Core network design and analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been used. Therefore, in this paper, the 6 G wireless network is used along with Deep Learning to solve the above challenges by introducing a new methodology named Optimizing Computer Vision with AI-enabled technology (OCV-AI). This research uses deep learning – efficiency algorithms (DL-EA) for computer vision to address the issues mentioned and improve the system's outcome. Therefore, deep learning 6 G proposed frameworks (Dl-6 G) are suggested in this paper to recognize pattern recognition and intelligent management systems and provide driven methodology planned to be provisioned automatically.

Based on firm-level data from the German part of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2018, we examine the role of different AI methods and application areas in innovation. The results show that 5.8% of firms in Germany were actively using AI in their business operations or products and services in 2019. We find that the use of AI is associated with annual sales with world-first product innovations in these firms of about €16 billion (i.e. 18% of total annual sales of world-first innovations). In addition, AI technologies have been used in process innovation that contributed to about 6% of total annual cost savings of the German business sector. Firms that apply AI broadly (using different methods for different applications areas) and that have already several years of experience in using AI obtain significantly higher innovation results.

These accidents lead to direct economic damages, which results in the withdrawal of capital for the reconstruction of damaged areas. In addition, there are other indirect economic losses, such as business interruption and reputational losses. The DOW Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI-DOW) is currently the most complete methodology for quantifying economic losses. Notwithstanding, the F&EI-DOW focuses on quantifying the hazardous potential of process units, and, does not provide an overall criterion for the hazardous potential of the entire industrial site with regard to: the inclusion of the so-called domino effect, the probabilistic risk assessment, the updating of existing risk analysis tools with new emerging Artificial Intelligence Techniques, and the quantification of reputation losses. For this purpose, the development of a new Fire and Explosion Economic Losses-Index (FEEL-Index) is proposed, which integrates the F&EI-DOW with new factors, such as the Damaged Area Factor, the Accident Probability Factor and the Reputation Loss Factor. With regard to the application to a case study, the total losses quantified by the overall FEEL-Index predict a value higher than the one predicted by the F&EI-DOW. The results obtained on an hydrocarbon storage case study show that the application of the FEEL-Index is relevant for increasing the risk perception, as well as providing guidance for prevention, mitigation, and risk management of accidents in process industries. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Artificial Intelligence; Domino effect; Economic impact; Explosion; Fire; Risk analysis","Accidents; Artificial intelligence; Explosions; Hazards; Hydrocarbons; Losses; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Case-studies; Damaged area; Domino effects; Economic damages; Economic impacts; Economic loss; Fire and explosion; Loss indices; New approaches; Storage sites; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133938691

Considering a survey-based sample of buyers of supersaver tickets, we use causal machine learning to assess the impact of the discount rate on rescheduling a trip, which seems relevant in the light of capacity constraints at rush hours. Assuming that (i) the discount rate is quasi-random conditional on our rich set of characteristics and (ii) the buying decision increases weakly monotonically in the discount rate, we identify the discount rate's effect among ‘always buyers’, who would have traveled even without a discount, based on our survey that asks about customer behavior in the absence of discounts. We find that on average, increasing the discount rate by one percentage point increases the share of rescheduled trips by 0.16 percentage points among always buyers.

It defines four “basic AI virtues”, namely justice, honesty, responsibility and care, all of which represent specific motivational settings that constitute the very precondition for ethical decision making in the AI field. Moreover, it defines two “second-order AI virtues”, prudence and fortitude, that bolster achieving the basic virtues by helping with overcoming bounded ethicality or hidden psychological forces that can impair ethical decision making and that are hitherto disregarded in AI ethics. Lastly, the paper describes measures for successfully cultivating the mentioned virtues in organizations dealing with AI research and development. © 2022, The Author(s).","AI ethics; AI virtues; Artificial intelligence; Bounded ethicality; Business ethics; Implementation; Machine learning; Moral psychology",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132138493

Understanding of climate change impact is important to design adaptation options for dry land agricultural systems. Thus, the present review was conducted with the objectives to identify gaps and suggest technology-based intervention that can support dry land farming under changing climate. Careful management of the available agricultural resources in the region is a current need, as it will play crucial role in the coming decades to ensure food security, reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Technology based regional collaborative interventions among Universities, Institutions, Growers, Companies etc. for water conservation, supplemental irrigation, foliar sprays, integrated nutrient management, resilient crops-based cropping systems, artificial intelligence, and precision agriculture (modeling and remote sensing) are needed to support agriculture of the region. Different process-based models have been used in different regions around the world to quantify the impacts of climate change at field, regional, and national scales to design management options for dryland cropping systems. Modeling include water and nutrient management, ideotype designing, modification in tillage practices, application of cover crops, insect, and disease management. However, diversification in the mixed and integrated crop and livestock farming system is needed to have profitable, sustainable business. The main focus in this work is to recommend different agro-adaptation measures to be part of policies for sustainable agricultural production systems in future. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Cropping systems; Diversification; Management options; Precision agriculture",,Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130279576

Blockchain technology integrates different recognition techniques of distributed pattern for monitoring database of a dedicated network and has proven a very promising technology. An automated pattern recognition decentralizes and distributes customized specific data. Machine learning, originated from artificial intelligence is primarily related to recognition of behavior patterns. Methods like knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining focus on unsupervised approaches and are widely used in business and climatic weather applications. Blockchain addresses data-security concerns and builds trust by creating distributed ledger. Theft, willful fraud, software and hardware are considered by blockchain in data protection. Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable. The predictive model aids in identifying customers at churn risk in the telecommunication system. Existing proactive methods are unable to explain difficulties in customer interaction understanding and meeting their genuine needs. The proposed model organizes the customer situation and designs a customer proactive re-engagement over mobile-based telecommunication systems. Performance measures like churn prediction, classifier, confusion matrix, machine learning in the telecommunication system are used to evaluate and validate the results. © 2022","Blockchain technology; Churn prediction; Classifier; Climatic Weather; Support vector machine; Telecommunication system","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Crime; Data mining; Distributed ledger; Forecasting; Hash functions; Hidden Markov models; Recurrent neural networks; Sales; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Churn predictions; Climatic weather; Customer retention; Customer-service; Distributed patterns; Prediction-based; Proactive measures; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125816960

Design/methodology/approach: Exploratory, inductive research design. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with 47 bank managers in both developed and developing countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria and Vietnam. Findings: Managers are aware of the prospects of AI and are making efforts to address AI as a business need but find that there often exist certain challenges in accelerating AI adoption. The study also presents a conceptual framework of AI in relation to financial service marketing, which captures and highlights the interactions among the customers, banks and external stakeholders, as well as the regulators. Research limitations/implications: Banks must understand their business objectives, the available resources and the needs of their customers. Managers should keep the ethical implications of their working relationships in mind when selecting a team or collaborating with partners. In addition, managers should be trained and assisted in comprehending AI in relation to financial services, while the regulators must be involved in the development of AI for financial service marketing. Finally, it is critical to communicate the prospects for AI to consumers. Originality/value: This study provides empirical insight into the opportunities, prospects and challenges pertaining to the use of AI in the area of financial service marketing. It also specifically calls into question certain preconceptions regarding AI and its role in financial services, the chatbots adopted for financial service delivery and the role of marketing managers in developing AI. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Banking; Financial services; Managers; Marketing; Qualitative",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122124821

By bringing together some of the emerging changes in education governance, in this article we argue for a new constitution of governance, precision education governance. Precision education governance combines three overlapping and strengthening lines of governance: (i) global governance of education, (ii) marketisation, privatisation and digitalisation, and (iii) behavioural and life sciences as the basis for managing the future education. In the article, we highlight the importance in bringing these so far separately studied lines together to understand how they shape the aims and outcomes of education, knowledge and understanding of human subjectivity more thoroughly than before. © The Author(s) 2021.","behavioural and life sciences; datafication; digitalisation; marketisation; Precision education governance; privatisation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121836287

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to develop a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) mathematical model with a single-objective, single-product, multi-stage closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSC ND), considering the fixed transportation charge in the distribution network that has been neglected in the recently published papers in the field of CLSC ND. Since such network design challenges belong to the class of NP-hard problems, an algorithm based on ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed to design a multi-stage RL network with fixed transportation cost and variable cost for the routes. Four network characteristics of different sizes were designed, and 30 instances were randomly generated for each network characteristic to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The computational analysis of the results shows the high-quality effectiveness of the proposed ACO algorithm compared with the exact results. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","ant colony optimization; Closed-loop supply chain; logistics network; reverse logistics","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Integer programming; Logistics; Nonlinear programming; Product design; Quality control; Transportation routes; Ant colonies; Closed-loop; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain network designs; Customers' satisfaction; Logistics network; Multi-stages; Network characteristics; Reverse logistic networks; Reverse logistics; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119913228

In this study, it is aimed to investigate the perceived management and customer support for corporate social responsibility, the identification of the employees with the business and the customers and its effect on CO. Another aim of the study is to obtain a model that classifies employee–customer identification (ECI)-CO levels for employees by using artificial intelligence methods not used in previous studies. The research data were obtained from salesperson working in shopping malls in Istanbul. Hypothesis testing with structural equation modelling (SEM) has shown that perceived management and customer support for corporate social responsibility have an impact on employee identification with the business and customers. It has been observed that ECI affects CO, while organizational identification has no significant effect on CO.

It is also causing several irreversible shifts in most of the job structure, exacerbating the rift between workforce capabilities and the expectations of the employers. In this industrial revolution, the ability to anticipate future changes in employment trends and the knowledge to adapt to those changes is a necessity in helping organizations to stay competitive and productive. In other words, companies need to focus on two aspects 1- technical aspects of change (technological advancements and computerization) and 2- the people-related aspects (educating and growing the workforce skills). Limited availability of research on both aspects, specifically educating aspects such as the skills/capabilities of the workforce and the available job training curriculum, in the industrial distribution industry and especially warehousing has drawn our attention for doing this research. Regarding Small and Mid-size Enterprises (SME), Koshal et al., 2019 outlines some of the results obtained from a survey comprising sixteen Likert-type questions, gathered from 56 potential respondents from industries such as manufacturing, retail, distribution and third-party organizations. Results show a lack of confidence in executives with regards to employees' preparedness for future technological advancements and the available training. They offered collecting open response data to provide further information on the role educational institutions play in better preparing the future workforce. Furthermore, Xie et al.,2020 provides us with a systematic review of the available literature on how to train and prepare a specific population, warehouse workers, in the face of industry 4.0. In this work, we have investigated the impact of industry 4.0 on the industrial distribution industry and warehousing, as a heart of the company's operations. We have targeted different Business-to-business sectors located across the USA and conducted interviews with 22 individuals from CEO positions down to warehouse/operations managers. Common technologies identified in these industries included but not limited to, barcoding through Radio Frequency (RF) handlers, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), followed by the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for process automations. According to the previous related works, we will explore our factual interview data on addressing challenges faced by warehouses' managers and employees with regard to using future automation and designing training and educational programs that will address both technical and professional skills of these workforce of the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",,"Big data; Engineering education; Enterprise resource planning; Human resource management; Learning systems; Managers; Personnel training; Process control; Robot programming; Surveys; Warehouses; Employment trends; Industrial distribution; Industrial revolutions; Innovative technology; Job trainings; Process automation; Technical aspects; Technological advancement; Training curriculum; Way industries; Industry 4.0",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138302264

The IoT can afford businesses predictive maintenance, improve field service, asset tracking, and further enhance customer satisfaction and facility management in industrial sectors. However, the privacy concern in IoT is a big challenge in IoT applications and services. This work proposed a lightweight privacy-preserving scheme based on homomorphic encryption in the context of the IoT, in which we investigated and analyzed the privacy issues between the data owners, untrustworthy third-party cloud servers, and the data users.

In addition, as more time series data are collected and stored, how to handle the huge amount of data efficiently is crucial in many applications. We note that these significant challenges exist in various tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and fault cause localization. Therefore, how to design effective and efficient time series models for different tasks, which are robust to address the aforementioned challenging patterns and noise in real-world scenarios, is of great theoretical and practical interests. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive and organized tutorial on the state-of-the-art algorithms of robust time series analysis, ranging from traditional statistical methods to the most recent deep learning based methods. We will not only introduce the principle of time series algorithms, but also provide insights into how to apply them effectively in practical real-world industrial applications. Specifically, we organize the tutorial in a bottom-up framework. We first present preliminaries from different disciplines including robust statistics, signal processing, optimization, and deep learning. Then, we identify and discuss those most-frequently processing blocks in robust time series analysis, including periodicity detection, trend filtering, seasonal-trend decomposition, and time series similarity. Lastly, we discuss recent advances in multiple time series tasks including forecasting, anomaly detection, fault cause localization, and autoscaling, as well as practical lessons of large-scale time series applications from an industrial perspective. © 2022 Owner/Author.","anomaly detection; forecasting; robustness; root cause analysis; time series","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Fault detection; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Signal processing; Time series; Ubiquitous computing; Anomaly detection; Business-intelligence; Cloud-computing; Localisation; Real-world scenario; Robustness; Root cause analysis; Time-series analysis; Time-series data; Times series; Time series analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137151265

Therefore, we propose an end-to-end automated decision support system with explanation for business processes.

Increasingly, the applications of AI are no longer limited to search and recommendation systems, such as web search and movie and product recommendations, but AI is also being used in decisions and processes that are critical for individuals, businesses, and society. With AI based solutions in high-stakes domains such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI are far-reaching. Consequently, it becomes critical to ensure that these models are making accurate predictions, are robust to shifts in the data, are not relying on spurious features, and are not unduly discriminating against minority groups. To this end, several approaches spanning various areas such as explainability, fairness, and robustness have been proposed in recent literature, and many papers and tutorials on these topics have been presented in recent computer science conferences. However, there is relatively less attention on the need for monitoring machine learning (ML) models once they are deployed and the associated research challenges. In this tutorial, we first motivate the need for ML model monitoring[14], as part of a broader AI model governance[9] and responsible AI framework, from societal, legal, customer/end-user, and model developer perspectives, and provide a roadmap for thinking about model monitoring in practice. We then present findings and insights on model monitoring desiderata based on interviews with various ML practitioners spanning domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, online retail, computational advertising, and conversational assistants[15]. We then describe the technical considerations and challenges associated with realizing the above desiderata in practice. We provide an overview of techniques/tools for model monitoring (e.g., see [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10-13, 18-21]. Then, we focus on the real-world application of model monitoring methods and tools [3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 16, 17], present practical challenges/guidelines for using such techniques effectively, and lessons learned from deploying model monitoring tools for several web-scale AI/ML applications.

Today, many RecSys solutions deployed in the real world rely on categorical user-profiles and/or pre-calculated recommendation actions that stay static during a user session. However, recent trends suggest that RecSys need to model user intent in real time and constantly adapt to meet user needs at the moment or change user behavior in situ. There are three primary drivers for this emerging need of online adaptation. First, in order to meet the increasing demand for a better personalized experience, the personalization dimensions and space will grow larger and larger. It would not be feasible to pre-compute recommended actions for all personalization scenarios beyond a certain scale. Second, in many settings the system does not have user prior history to leverage. Estimating user intent in real time is the only feasible way to personalize. As various consumer privacy laws tighten, it is foreseeable that many businesses will reduce their reliance on static user profiles. Therefore, it makes the modeling of user intent in real time an important research topic. Third, a user's intent often changes within a session and between sessions, and user behavior could shift significantly during dramatic events. A RecSys should adapt in real time to meet user needs and be robust against distribution shifts. The online and adaptive recommender systems (OARS) workshop offers a focused discussion of the study and application of OARS, and will bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners from both industry and academia. KDD, as the premier data science conference, is an ideal venue to gather leaders in the field to further research into OARS and promote its adoption. This workshop is complementary to several sessions of the main conference (e.g., recommendation, reinforcement learning, etc.) and brings them together using a practical and focused application. © 2022 Owner/Author.","artificial intelligence; data science; machine learning; recommender system","Behavioral research; Data Science; Learning systems; Online systems; Reinforcement learning; User profile; Dynamic information; Machine-learning; Personalizations; Real- time; Real-world; System solution; User behaviors; User need; User sessions; User's profiles; Recommender systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137141501

However, the role of customer trust has received limited attention in the home-sharing economy. Drawing on the revised stimulus organism response model and trust transfer theory, this paper examines how customer trust in home-sharing hosts and platforms affects customer relationships, manifested in customer engagement and loyalty. As artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively utilized within home-sharing platforms to facilitate business operations and enhance the customer experience, this study also examines the influence of AI on customer trust and other related outcomes. The research was undertaken in China, with respondents who had used home-sharing platforms. Results from structural equation modeling show that customer trust had a significant positive relationship with customer engagement and loyalty. Customer engagement mediates the relationship between trust and loyalty, while AI may have a negative moderating effect between host trust and customer engagement and customer engagement and loyalty.

The digital age has brought a lot of changes transforming the business environment. The extensive use of the internet combined with the recent technological advances have greatly affected tourism companies, which need to face increased competition, changing tourists' needs and quick development of customer services. Furthermore, due to the widespread digitization, the tourism industry is overwhelmed by a huge amount of data that needs to be processed and analysed. AI is a rapidly evolving set of technologies, which can to some extent replace the analytical ability and decision-making capabilities of human beings. It can thus enable the development of innovative services and the intelligent processing of large amounts of data. Although AI is a widely known technology, it is still not widely used in the tourism industry. However, the adoption of AI is accelerated during the last 3 years, which is also reflected in the literature. By conducting an extensive literature review, this study aims to examine the level of adoption of AI applications in different sectors of the tourism industry and to discuss their role in big data analytics and in smart tourism (ST). It also aims to examine under which circumstances the adoption of these applications and technologies could enable tourism companies to obtain a competitive advantage. To explain this, the paper develops a conceptual framework using the resource based view theory. Based on the proposed framework, it shows that the adoption of the above combination may enable tourism companies to increase their business performance, achieve economic results and potentially attain a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, this research discusses the strategic role of AI and BDA in ST, makes propositions of implementation and forms the base for future research. © 2022 WIT Press.","artificial intelligence; big data analytics; business performance; competitive advantage; smart tourism; tourism industry",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136250167

This paper aims to highlight the potential effects of Industry 4.0 on AM via tools such as digitalisation, data transfer, tagging technology, information in Industry 4.0 and intelligent features. Design/methodology/approach: In successive phases of industrialisation, there has been a rise in the use of, and dependence on, data in manufacturing. In this review of Industry 4.0 and AM, the five pillars of success that could see the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, robotics and materials science enabling new levels of interactivity and interdependence between suppliers, producers and users are discussed. The unique effects of AM capabilities, in particular mass customisation and light-weighting, combined with the integration of data and IoT in Industry 4.0, are studied for their potential to support higher efficiencies, greater utility and more ecologically friendly production. This research also illustrates how the digitalisation of manufacturing for Industry 4.0, through the use of IoT and AM, enables new business models and production practices. Findings: The discussion illustrates the potential of combining IoT and AM to provide an escape from the constraints and limitations of conventional mass production whilst achieving economic and ecological savings. It should also be noted that this extends to the agile design and fabrication of increasingly complex parts enabled by simulations of complex production processes and operating systems. This paper also discusses the relationship between Industry 4.0 and AM with respect to improving the quality and robustness of product outcomes, based on real-time data/feedback. Originality/value: This research shows how a combined approach to research into IoT and AM can create a step change in practice that alters the production and supply paradigm, potentially reducing the ecological impact of industrial systems and product life cycle.

The specific objectives are to identify changes in logistical activities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, to determine the dynamics of changes in business revenues and in quantitative parameters for total logistics services and their segments during the pandemic, to establish the relationship between the economic situation and parameters related to logistics services, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the method of purposive selection, Poland, which is well developed in logistics and aspires to be a crucial logistical hub of Europe, was selected for the study. The analysed period covered the years 2015–2021. The material sources were the literature on the subject and data from reports on individual logistics segments. Dynamic indicators with a fixed and variable base, coefficient of variation and Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient were used for analysis and presentation. It was found that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated changes in logistics activities. These changes included digitalisation, the development of the e-commerce market, multi-channel sales and the development of these services, and the introduction of automation and artificial intelligence. In all activities, 2020 was the most challenging year, but there was generally a reduction in revenue growth and, less often, stagnation. Logistics companies gained in the second year of the pandemic (2021) when implemented solutions generated record revenues. Among the winning segments were logistics services in general, especially sea freight forwarding, warehousing services, courier services related to e-commerce, and a lesser extent, freight transport. Losses were incurred in the segment related to passenger transport. COVID-19 became a positive catalyst for change. The logistics industry ultimately benefited from the pandemic. Additionally, due to the pandemic, logistics operations have had greater sustainability, contributing to resource conservation and environmental protection. © 2022 by the authors.","courier services; digitisation of logistics; innovations in logistics; logistics companies; logistics market; passenger transport; smart logistics; transport of goods; warehouse rental; warehouse space","electronic commerce; Europe; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137747984

PPM enables foreseeing the future of an ongoing business process by predicting, for example, relevant information on the way in which running processes terminate or on related process performance indicators. A large share of PPM approaches adopt Machine Learning (ML), taking advantage of the accuracy and precision of ML models. Consequently, PPM inherits the challenges of traditional ML approaches. One of these challenges concerns the need to gain user trust in the generated predictions. This issue is addressed by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). However, in addition to ML characteristics, the choices made and the techniques applied in the context of PPM influence the resulting explanations. This necessitates the availability of a study on the effects of different choices made in the context of a PPM task on the explainability of the generated predictions. In order to address this gap, we systemically investigate the effects of different PPM settings on the data fed into an ML model and subsequently into the employed XAI method. We study how differences between the resulting explanations indicate several issues in the underlying data. Example of these issues include collinearity and high dimensionality of the input data. We construct a framework for performing a series of experiments to examine different choices of PPM dimensions (i.e., event logs, preprocessing configurations, and ML models), integrating XAI as a fundamental component. In addition to agreements, the experiments highlight several inconsistencies between data characteristics and important predictors used by the ML model on one hand, and explanations of predictions of the investigated ML model on the other. © 2022 by the authors.","machine learning; machine learning eXplainability; outcome prediction; predictive process monitoring; process mining; XAI",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137356855

A large part of this level of automation is due to the use of robotics, which in turn ends up both hindering and accelerating the process of Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is driven by innovative technologies that have an effect on production systems and business models. Although technologies are the driving motors of production within Industry 4.0, many production systems require collaboration between robotics and humans, and safety is required for both parties. Given the need for robots to collaborate with humans simultaneously or in parallel, a new generation of robots, called cobots, “Collaborative Robots”, are gaining prominence to face these challenges. With cobots, it is possible to overcome security barriers and envisage working safely side-by-side with humans. This paper presents the development and testing of a low-cost, within standards, 6-axis collaborative robot that can be used for educational purposes in different task-specific applications. The development of this collaborative robot involves the design and 3D printing of the structure (connections and parts), sizing and selection of circuits and/or electronic components, programming, and control. Furthermore, this study considers the development of a user interface application with the robotic arm. Thus, the application of technological solutions, as well as of the scientific and educational approaches used in the development of cobots can foster the wide implementation of Industry 4.0. © 2022 by the authors.","3D printing; collaborative robot; control; direct and indirect kinematics; electronic circuit; filaments; human; Industry 4.0; MATLAB; microcontroller; motor; safety; technologies",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137220877

This study aimed to determine the optimal machine learning predictive model for the credit risk of companies under the Reactiva Peru Program because of COVID-19. A multivariate regression analysis was applied with four regressor variables (economic sector, granting entity, amount covered, and department) and one predictor (risk level), with a population of 501,298 companies benefiting from the program, under the CRISP-DM methodology oriented especially for data mining projects, with artificial intelligence techniques under the machine learning Lasso and Ridge regression models, with econometric algebraic mathematical verification to compare and validate the predictive models using SPSS, Jamovi, R Studio, and MATLAB software. The results revealed a better Lasso regression model (λ60 = 0.00038; RMSE = 0.3573685) that optimally predicted the level of risk compared to the Ridge regression model (λ100 = 0.00910; RMSE = 0.3573812) and the least squares model with algebraic mathematics, which corroborates that the Lasso regression model is the best predictive model to detect the level of credit risk of the Reactiva Peru Program.

The rapid digitalization and technological advancement of financial institutions (FI) have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such branchless banks are expected to offer financial customers meaningful access whilst promoting responsible usage of suitable and affordable financial solutions. The objectives of this paper are to identify CSF to conduct branchless banking for bank performance during the attack of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. These CSFs are important to reinforce the new business model recommended by the central bank of Malaysia (BNM). Through this study five CSFs have been identified which are customers do not physically attend to the bank for their banking needs, it is more efficient, saves time, secured, and low cost. As the industrial revolution (IR) 4.0 approaches, public acceptance, innovation, and strong financial services, as well as demand of digital payment will take over the country.

This has increased the number of online multi-category e-commerce retailers that sell a variety of product categories. Due to the growth in the number of players, each company needs to optimize its own business strategy in order to compete. Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a common metric that multi-category e-commerce retailers usually consider for competition because it helps determine the most valuable customers for the retailers. However, in this paper, we introduce two additional novel factors in addition to CLV to determine which customers will bring in the highest revenue in the future: distinct product category (DPC) and trend in amount spent (TAS). Then, we propose a new framework. We utilized, for the first time in the relevant literature, a multi-output deep neural network (DNN) model to test our proposed framework while forecasting CLV, DPC, and TAS together. To make this outcome applicable in real life, we constructed customer clusters that allow the management of multi-category e-commerce companies to segment end-users based on the three variables. We compared the proposed framework (constructed with multiple outputs: CLV, DPC, and TAS) against a baseline single-output model to determine the combined effect of the multi-output model. In addition, we also compared the proposed model with multi-output Decision Tree (DT) and multi-output Random Forest (RF) algorithms on the same dataset. The results indicate that the multi-output DNN model outperforms the single-output DNN model, multi-output DT, and multi-output RF across all assessment measures, proving that the multi-output DNN model is more suitable for multi-category e-commerce retailers’ usage. Furthermore, Shapley values derived through the explainable artificial intelligence method are used to interpret the decisions of the DNN. This practice demonstrates which inputs contribute more to the outcomes (a significant novelty in interpreting the DNN model for the CLV). © 2022 by the authors.","customer lifetime value; customer segmentation; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); multi-category e-commerce; multi-output deep learning models","Costs; Decision trees; Electronic commerce; Neural network models; Sales; Customer lifetime value; Customers segmentations; E- commerces; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Learning models; Multi-category e-commerce; Multi-output; Multi-output deep learning model; Neural network model; Product categories; Deep neural networks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136626228

Solving this problem could improve transportation efficiency to bring great benefit to shipping customers. During the last two decades, many heuristic, meta-heuristic and hybrid algorithms have been proposed to maximize container volume utilization to reduce the waste of container space significantly. Despite their success in many real-world applications, it is still a challenging task to recommend satisfactory loading levels within a limited time frame when clients approach for options of different combinations of shipping items. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-strategy hybrid heuristic algorithm to achieve timely planning for clients in a required short time frame. In specific, a probabilistic model is used to combine the strength of two optimization strategies, i.e. an ant colony method and a constructive greedy method, to speed up the optimization process and ensure better convergence. In addition, a tree pruning strategy is designed to further improve the efficiency of the hybrid heuristic algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of both volume utilization rate and algorithm processing speed compared to state-of-the-art methods. Based on the comparison results by using BR dataset, we achieved averagely 94.31% volume utilization rate and 50.16 s processing speed, which is the best performance by considering both algorithm effectiveness and efficiency. Further, our proposed method has been deployed in a real business case to provide plan solutions to individual customer shipping requests and achieved high customer satisfaction rate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","3D-CLP; Ant colony algorithm; Constructive heuristic algorithm; Multi-strategy optimization; Weakly heterogeneous single container loading problem","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Customer satisfaction; Efficiency; Heuristic algorithms; Loading; Sales; Ships; Trees (mathematics); 3d-CLP; Ant colonies algorithm; Constructive heuristic algorithm; Container-loading problems; Hybrid heuristic algorithms; Loading problem; Multi-strategy optimization; Single container loading; Strategy optimization; Weakly heterogeneous single container loading problem; Containers",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132231873

In this framework, artificial intelligence, GIS, geospatial analysis and space assets can play a crucial role. Social media analytics can be used to trigger Earth Observation (EO) satellite acquisitions over potential new areas of human aggregation. Similarly, EO satellites can be used jointly with social media analytics to systematically monitor well-known areas of aggregation (green urban areas, public markets, etc.). The information that can be obtained from the Earth Cognitive System 4 COVID-19 (ECO4CO) are both predictive, aiming to identify possible new clusters of outbreaks, and at the same time supervisorial, by monitoring infrastructures (i.e. traffic jams, parking lots) or specific categories (i.e. teenagers, doctors, teachers, etc.). In this perspective, the technologies described in this paper will allow us to detect critical areas where individuals can be involved in risky aggregation clusters. The ECO4CO data lake will be integrated with ad hoc data obtained by health care structures to understand trends and dynamics, to assess criticalities with respect to medical response and supplies, and to test possibilities useful to tackle potential future emergencies. The System will also provide geographical information on the spread of the infection which will allow an appropriate context-specific public health response to the epidemic.

To better understand the ergonomic design of such systems and how to integrate them in strategic management driven by artificial intelligence, we engaged in a systematic literature review to summarize the field and guide future research. We identified use cases, data source types, and algorithms that have been developed in 40 publications between 2002 and 2019. We found that existing approaches neglect to identify indirect and potential competitors at the periphery of a company's vision. Such a blind spot exposes companies to increased risks of disruption, given that disruptive change often starts in the form of weak signals.

Addressing sustainability concerning stakeholders' opinions aligned with upstream policies escalates the problem, demanding new reliable frameworks. This paper aims to develop an integrated simulation–optimization decision support system for electricity generation planning. A differential evolution algorithm simulates the future power supply configurations. A linear programming model characterizes the optimal pathways towards those futures. Multi-criteria decision-making methods are also included for determining the preference weights of sustainability indicators and ranking the scenarios. The proposed framework offers a sustainable plan for Iran by 2050. The sustainability criteria are tracked and compared with a business as usual (BAU) scheme. The results show that the broader deployment of wind turbine primarily, solar thermal subsequently, is the major source of difference in the sustainable expansion compared to BAU. Those technologies along with photovoltaics, contribute to 48% of the generation at the end of the planning horizon. However, the findings indicate that even the extensive utilization of renewable energy sources cannot guarantee sustainability improvement all through the planning period. Thus, supply-side plans should be appropriately supported by demand-side strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionary algorithm; Optimization; Renewable electricity; Simulation; Sustainability","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electric power generation; Evolutionary algorithms; Linear programming; Renewable energy resources; Business-as-usual; Electricity-generation system; Integrated simulations; Modeling approach; Optimisations; Power supply; Renewable electricity; Simulation; Simulation-optimization models; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development; algorithm; alternative energy; computer simulation; decision making; demand-side management; electricity generation; energy planning; energy resource; integrated approach; numerical model; optimization; power plant; strategic approach; sustainability; technology adoption; wind power; wind turbine; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123049685

Consider a pool of lessons and a number of students who are required to take a subset of these lessons to graduate. Each lesson consists of a predetermined and consecutive sequence of phases with possibly different resource requirements and duration. Students who take a lesson must be present in certain phases of the lesson. Similarly, resources that are allocated to the lesson must be present in certain phases of the lesson depending on their roles. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of student-lesson allocations subject to some capacity, availability and prerequisite constraints. The problem is formulated as an integer linear program called the session-index formulation. The formulation is then extended by introducing various side constraints that capture business requirements of a pilot training program. An enhanced branch-and-check algorithm is proposed to solve the problem more efficiently. Large instances of the problem are solved by utilizing an effective fix-and-optimize matheuristic. Results of a computational study on a set of real-world instances of the problem demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed exact and matheuristic algorithms.

We run text mining algorithms to identify the types of risks from narratives and incorporate them with a readability measure (i.e., linguistic cue(s)) to conjecture a firm manager’s attitude toward corporate risk. We consider a two-stage network data envelopment analysis (TNDEA) with the benefit of opening up the black-box of a production process via considering internal activities. The outcome derived from TNDEA is determined by users who decide “a priori” what the specification of the model should be, without considering any alternatives. The study further incorporates the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with TNDEA by considering inclusion/exclusion or different combinations of inputs, intermediates, and outputs so as to realize a corporate’s underlying business situation. Decision attributes taken from the outcome of FRST-TNDEA and condition attributes gathered from annual reports are jointly inserted into an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to establish the forecasting model. The integrated circuit (IC) industry has long been viewed as an essential backbone of Taiwan’s economy, and therefore it is taken as our research target. The results show that the introduced linguistic cues have positive and considerable impacts on firm performance. Overall, the findings herein provide direct support for recent regulators that require corporates to add a new section on risk factors in accounting narratives so as to prevent users from making biased judgments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Readability; Risk management; Text mining",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115318894

The emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are expected to augment the decision making in Asset Management (AM) and Fleet Management (FM). The AI technologies need to be adapted to the specific needs of any industrial domain, e.g. railways, to facilitate the implementation and achievement of the overall business goals. This adaptation is denoted as ‘Industrial AI’(IAI). IAI for railways infrastructure and rolling stock, is dependent on an appropriate technology roadmap reflecting necessary know-hows. The IAI roadmap aims to provide a strategic and executive plan to augment managing railway assets i.e. ‘Augmented Asset Management (AAM)’. AAM can be applied through an end-to-end secure platform for e.g. data sharing among stakeholders, the development of analytics, and model sharing through distributed computing. AAM in railways can be enhanced through implementation of a generic fleet management (FM) approach. In the FM approach, any population of assets with common characteristics and also the relationship of the asset to the fleet is considered. This paper aims to develop and propose a concept for AAM enabled through IAI and digital technologies to provide augmented decision support through a secure platform, for AM in railways. A FM approach towards a holistic operation and maintenance of assets, based on a System of Systems thinking, for AAM in railways is applied for population of infrastructure assets and rolling stock assets with common characteristics. Finally, a taxonomy of issues and challenges, in the application of AAM to FM in railways is provided. The data for this taxonomy has been collected from railway organizations through iterative rounds of interviews. This taxonomy can be used for research and development of frameworks, approaches, technologies, and methodologies for AAM in railways. © IMechE 2021.","Asset management in railways; augmented asset management; decision support systems; fleet management in railways; Industrial Artificial Intelligence; maintenance in railways; railways; rolling stock","Artificial intelligence; Asset management; Data Sharing; Decision making; Decision support systems; Fleet operations; Frequency modulation; Iterative methods; Railroad rolling stock; Railroads; System of systems; Taxonomies; Appropriate technologies; Decision supports; Digital technologies; Infrastructure assets; Issues and challenges; Operation and maintenance; Railways infrastructures; Research and development; Railroad transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114879353

Based on this, this work first makes a detailed analysis of the business environment and CLR. Second, the research hypotheses are put forward, and the conceptual model is proposed. At the same time, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to analyze the business environment, ES, and ED, and their relationships. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) is constructed and the CLR-optimized business environment is used as the intermediary variable to explore the impact of the business environment on ES and ED. Then, 200 QSs (recovering 192 valid ones) are distributed to investigate entrepreneurs' attitudes toward ES and ED in different regions. Statistical analysis and independent t-tests are performed on the survey results to judge the relationship between variables. The results of empirical analysis show that (1) The significance coefficient P of ES and ED is 0.005 < 0.01, and the scores of ES and ED of large enterprises are 132.7864 and 142.3243, respectively, which are the highest. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the ED. (2) The influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ES is 0.60, and the influence coefficient of CLR-optimized business regulation and ED is 0.75. Therefore, CLR-optimized business regulation plays a positive role in the development of ES. CLR-optimized business regulation plays a regulating role between ES and ED. (3) CLR-optimized business regulation has a significant positive impact on the formation of ES. The policy enlightenment of this work mainly has three points. First, optimizing the business environment can stimulate and protect ES, thus improving the quality of economic growth. All regions should promote “mass entrepreneurship and innovation” and high-quality economic development by improving the convergence of economic policies and building a legal and market-oriented business environment. Second, all regions should implement dynamic and differentiated policies to optimize the business environment's spatial pattern in Chinese cities. Third, there is a need to further strengthen the construction of new infrastructure through cutting-edge information technologies, such as Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI""as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere-emerging AI startups-and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: They often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI. © 2022 Owner/Author.","artificial intelligence; ethical systems; industry practice; organizational theory; qualitative methods","Ethical technology; Artificial intelligence tools; Company building; Critical questions; Ethical system; Industry practices; Institutional pressures; Organizational context; Organizational theory; Qualitative method; Tool change; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137167400

Although such models have been developed to try to reduce human bias and thus bring greater fairness to financial services decisions, studies have found that there is still significant discrimination by both face-To-face and algorithmic lenders. In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects. This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-The-Art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows:-What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them?-In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation?-To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques? Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it. © 2022 Owner/Author.","bias; fairness; financial services; machine learning","Crime; Economic and social effects; Finance; Risk assessment; Bias; Credit risks; Credit scoring; Detection models; Fairness; Financial service; Fraud detection; Intelligence models; Machine-learning; Risk detections; Machine learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137161652

We find that 58% of these startups have established a set of AI principles. Startups with data-sharing relationships with high-Technology firms or that have prior experience with privacy regulations are more likely to establish ethical AI principles and are more likely to take costly steps, like dropping training data or turning down business, to adhere to their ethical AI policies. Moreover, startups with ethical AI policies are more likely to invest in unconscious bias training, hire ethnic minorities and female programmers, seek expert advice, and search for more diverse training data.

The purpose of this research is to explore these issues and respond to calls in the literature to determine how AI can enhance salesperson adaptability and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from a sample of 246 B2B salespeople was used to test the conceptual model and research hypotheses. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The findings provide broad support for the model. An AI-feedback rich environment and salesperson feedback orientation predicted perceived accuracy of AI feedback which, in turn, strengthened intentions to use AI feedback. These favorable reactions to AI feedback positively related to adaptive selling behaviors, and adaptive selling behaviors mediated the relationships between intentions to use AI feedback and organizational commitment, as well as sales performance. Contrary to expectations, it did not mediate the relationship between intentions to use AI feedback and job satisfaction.

How can the AI-based and IT-based smart decision-support tools help implementation of circular economy principles from micro to macro scales? This chapter provides a conceptual framework about the current status and future development of smart decision-support tools for facilitating the circular transition of smart industry, focussing on the implementation of the industrial symbiosis (IS) practice. IS, which is aimed at replacing production inputs of one company with wastes generated by a different company, is considered as a promising strategy towards closing the material, energy and waste loops. Based on the principles of a circular economy, the utility of such practices to close resource loops is analyzed from a functional and operational perspective. For each life cycle phase of IS businesses – e.g., opportunity identification for symbiotic business, assessment of the symbiotic business and sustainable operations of the business – the role played by decision-support tools is described and embedding smartness in these tools is discussed. Based on the review of available tools and theoretical contributions in the field of IS, the characteristics, functionalities and utilities of smart decision-support tools are discussed within a circular economy transition framework. Tools based on recommender algorithms, machine learning techniques, multi-agent systems and life cycle analysis are critically assessed.

Text analysis are the simplest and most developed types of sentiment analysis so far. The text-based business sentiment analysis still has some unresolved challenges. For example, the machine learning algorithms are unable to recognize double meanings, jokes and allusions. The regional differences between language and non-native speech structures cannot be explained. To solve this problem, an undirected weighted graph is constructed for news topics. The sentences in an article are modeled as nodes, and the normalized sentence similarity is used as the link of the nodes, which can help avoid the influence of sentence length on the summary results. In the topic extraction process, the keywords are not limited to a single word, to achieve the purpose of improving the readability of the abstract. To improve the accuracy of sentiment classification, this work proposes a robust news mining-based business sentiment analysis framework, called BuSeD. It contains two main stages: (1) news collection and preprocessing, and (2) feature extraction and sentiment classification. In the first stage, the news is collected by using crawler tools. The news dataset is then preprocessed by reducing noises. In the second stage, topics in each article is extracted by using traditional topic extraction tools. And then a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based text analyzing model is designed to analyze news from sentence level. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of BuSeD for sentiment classification. Compared with four classical classification algorithms, the proposed CNN-based classification model of BuSeD achieves the highest F1 scores. We also present a quantitative trading application based on sentiment analysis to validate BuSeD, which indicates that the news-based business sentiment analysis has high economic application value.

New flexibility in value-capture concepts like dynamic and value-based pricing is introduced, which was impossible before. This paper explores two things. Firstly, how embracing contractual flexibility of price-variance and contract lengths influences customer perceived value in artificial intelligence (AI) enabled digital offerings. Secondly, the role transparency plays in the perceived value of such offerings. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an experiment-based survey and quantitative assessment within a business-to-business setup with 137 respondents across a couple of industrial manufacturers in the Nordic region. Findings: The authors observations indicate that value-capture-related flexibilities introduced by digital offerings, namely price fluctuations and longer contract lengths, are perceived to deliver more value to customers than standard offerings with known conditions. The authors findings indicate that introduced flexibilities are perceived as opportunities rather than uncertainties leading to higher perceived value by customers. The increased value perception can be explained by the transparency of these offerings provided by data-driven digital technologies'.

In the European Union context, the development of such new business is accompanied by a regulatory and political framework. An important aspect of this regulatory framework regards the legal conditions that enable the data collection, availability, sharing, use and reuse. Within the larger context, this article analyses the development of the European Union regulatory framework governing the availability, sharing and reuse of public sector data, also referred to as Public Sector Information policy. Anchored in the analytical tools provided by Discursive Institutionalism and Critical Data Studies and after studying the evolution of this policy over 25 years, this article argues that economic considerations have been overwhelmingly decisive in the European Union Public Sector Information policy and much less attention has been paid to fundamental rights and democracy issues. It also shows how European Union Public Sector Information policy contributes to the data infrastructure, enabling a thriving data-driven economy. In doing so, this article argues that the possible problematic effects of this new data-driven economy are not only affordances of the technology itself but are also the result of political and regulatory choices. More globally, the article stresses the need for policymakers to inscribe each of the policies and regulations affecting the digital transformation in the framework of fundamental rights and democracy. © The Author(s) 2022.","critical data studies; data economy; discursive institutionalism; open government data; Public sector information; regulation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139964407

In order to reduce the negative effects drilling has on the health of the environment, the drilling noise has to be measured, assessed, and controlled. The main purpose of this work is to investigate an experimental-intelligent method to predict the noise value of drilling in the dimension stone industry. For this purpose, 135 laboratory tests are designed on five types of rocks (four types of hard rock and one type of soft rock): and their results are measured in the first step. In the second step, due to the unpredicted and uncertain issues in this case, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are applied, and the modeling is conducted using three intelligent systems (IS): namely an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-SCM (ANFIS-SCM): an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-FCM (ANFIS-FCM): and the radial basis function network (RBF) neural network. 75% of the samples are considered for training, and the rest for testing. Several models are constructed, and the results indicate that although there is no significant difference between the models according to the performance indices, the proposed construction of ANFIS-SCM can be considered as an efficient tool in the evaluation of drilling noise. Finally, several scenarios are designed with different input modes, and the results obtained prove that the types of rock and the drill bits are more important than the operational characteristics of the machine. © 2022, Shahrood University of Technology.

Digital revolution, a paradigm shift of mechanical products into digital products; face-to-face services into virtual. Lower overhead costs, wide market, low entry barrier, no inventory issue are the points where digital products get edge over physical products. Feel-good experience marked even in case of services. Asynchronous featured, own-pace and timeliness digital services have added worth to the conventional one. Since the inception the pace of the digital change continues to accelerate like anything. Methodology: This review-paper considers vital research works done on digital product and digital services under the umbrella of the statutory provisions of GST. And magnifies both the aspects, digital market growth and GST provisions governing the same. Thus, the paper speaks about the factual role of GST Law, either maintaining transparency in digital transactions or marked to be a constraint. Implications: Nation like India, is witnessing an unprecedent growth post digitalization through ecommerce transactions. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cloud Based Platforms, Block-chain Technology are the new normal trends affecting how business interacts with clients and each other. Even Hybrid Work Model of rendering services has changed the conventional concept of office. The digital transactions happen over the internet and according to the Indian Laws such transactions are treated to be OIDAR that is Online Information Database Access & Retrievals. In this league levying charge on supply of intangible products or services is subject to a scrupulous statute and its provision. Conclusion: The nascent statute, Goods and Service Tax (GST) Laws have taken exclusively care of the same. A promising future with a digital hike has been registered. And imposing undisputed charge upon is tedious that the present statutory provisions are making it possible. © 2022 University of Stockholm.

We also included competences required for sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and circular economy. The selected competences formed the core for the conceptual development of a decision support tool for the individualised selection of training for employees. The concept was tested in customised training to improve employees’ skills and motivation for lifelong learning at the selected industrial partner. The developed assessment algorithm was used to monitor the progress of individual employees’ skills development before and after their training participation. The results of the assessment help human resource departments make decisions for selecting the most effective and optimal training for employees to improve their sustainability-related competences.

As a result of the scientific and technological revolution 4.0, organizational structures and business models have changed, and new ones have emerged. Consequently, the accounting activities that record operations and provide the necessary information to managers for decision making have faced threats, challenges, and opportunities, which have changed and will change the DNA of managerial accounting, determining a reinventing of it. As a result of the evolution of data collection and processing technologies, managerial accounting activities have become increasingly complex, encompassing increasing volumes of data. Resistance to change, organizational culture, lack of trust, and the high price of technology are the most critical barriers that interfere with adopting artificial intelligence technology in managerial accounting. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of artificial intelligence technology among accountants in Romanian organizations in the context of the modernization and digitization of managerial accounting. This research was quantitative, carried out through a survey based on a questionnaire. In total, 396 specialists in managerial accounting from Romanian organizations filled and returned the questionnaire. Using structural equation modeling, we tested the model of accepting artificial intelligence technology in managerial accounting. The results show that implementing artificial intelligence solutions in managerial accounting offers multiple options to managers through innovation and shortening processes, improves the use of accounting information, and is relatively easy to use, given the high degree of automation and customization. © 2022 by the author.","artificial intelligence; managerial accounting; technology acceptance; use; usefulness",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136426764

The field of managerial accounting is a successful example of the implementation of artificial intelligence in operations and the decision-making process based on accounting information. However, ethical issues within managerial accounting and those added through the implementation of artificial intelligence need to be addressed carefully. In this paper, the main objective is to investigate these ethical issues regarding the perception of accountants on the usefulness, efficiency, and effectiveness of implementing artificial intelligence in managerial accounting. To investigate these effects, we conducted a study based on a questionnaire among 396 accountants in Romania who use various artificial intelligence solutions in their activities in managerial accounting. The results of structural equation modeling showed that the ethical issues of autonomy, responsibility, and trust significantly influence the perceived usefulness and the performance of artificial intelligence solutions. The research concludes that artificial intelligence solutions solve many ethical issues in managerial accounting. Still, through their design and application, artificial intelligence solutions can create other ethical problems specific to managerial accounting and business ethics. Therefore, despite all the barriers and reluctance of professionals, artificial intelligence will substantially impact managerial accounting in the years to come. © 2022 by the author.","artificial intelligence; effectiveness; efficiency; ethical issues; managerial accounting; usefulness",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136420733

Investors also consider ESG indexes as an essential factor for their investments, and some research yielded that the return on sustainable funds is more significant than on non-sustainable ones. Nevertheless, a deficiency in research exists about analyzing ESG through artificial intelligence algorithms due to adversity in collecting ESG-related datasets. Therefore, this paper suggests integrated AI approaches to the ESG datasets with the five different experiments. We also focus on analyzing the governance and social datasets through NLP algorithms and propose a straightforward method for predicting a specific firm’s ESG rankings. Results were evaluated through accuracy score, RMSE, and MAE, and every experiment conducted relevant scores that achieved our aim. From the results, it could be concluded that this paper successfully analyzes ESG data with various algorithms. Unlike previous related research, this paper also emphasizes the importance of the adversarial attacks on the ESG datasets and suggests methods to detect them effectively. Furthermore, this paper proposes a simple way to predict ESG rankings, which would be helpful for small businesses. Even though it is our limitation that we only use restricted datasets, our research proposes the possibility of applying the AI algorithms to the ESG datasets in an integrated approach. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; data analysis; data science; deep learning; ESG; machine learning","algorithm; COVID-19; data acquisition; machine learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136371158

The main goal of researchers, engineers and technology companies is to increase the safety and optimality of the movement of vehicles, as well as to reduce the environmental damage caused by the automotive industry. The difficulty of managing traffic flows is that cars are driven by a person and their behavior, even in similar situations, is different and difficult to predict. To solve this problem, ground-based unmanned vehicles are increasingly being developed and implemented; however, like any other intelligent system, it is necessary to train different road scenarios. Currently, an engineer is driving an unmanned vehicle for training and thousands of kilometers are being driven for training. Of course, this approach to training unmanned vehicles is very long, and it is impossible to reproduce all the scenarios that can be found in real operations on a real road. Based on this, we offer a simulator of a realistic urban environment which allows you to reduce the training time and allows you to generate all kinds of events. To implement such a simulator, it is necessary to develop a method that would allow recreating a realistic world in one passage with cameras (monocular) installed on board the vehicle. Based on this, the purpose of this work is to develop an intelligent vehicle recognition system using convolutional neural networks, which allows you to create mesh objects for further placement in the simulator. It is important to note that the resulting objects should be optimal in size so as not to overload the system, since a large number of road infrastructure objects are stored there. Also, neural complexity should not be excessive. In this paper, the general concept and classification of convolutional neural networks are given, which allow solving the problem of recognizing 3D objects in images. Based on the analysis, the existing neural network architectures do not solve the problems mentioned above. In this connection, the authors first of all carried out the design of the system according to the methodology of modeling business processes, and also modified and developed the architecture of the neural network, which allows classifying objects with sufficient accuracy, obtaining optimized mesh objects and reducing computational complexity. The methods proposed in this paper are used in a simulator of a realistic urban environment, which reduces the time and computational costs when training unmanned transport systems. © 2022 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; CNN; neural networks; recognition","Accident prevention; Automotive industry; Complex networks; Convolution; Environmental technology; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Network architecture; Personnel training; Roads and streets; Simulators; Urban planning; Urban transportation; 20th century; 3D object; Convolutional neural network; Environmental damage; Neural-networks; Optimality; Rapid process; Recognition; Technology companies; Urban environments; Neural networks; car; car driving; human; movement (physiology); Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Humans; Movement; Neural Networks, Computer",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135113073

We present field study results from Texas and California that show the potential for imaging pipelines and other subsurface infrastructure by using AI-based methods on high-resolution aboveground magnetic data. The superior resolution and interpretability over conventional geophysical inversion is demonstrated. The method has the potential to provide actionable intelligence in several business-use cases for detecting and characterizing pipelines, crossing zones for multiple pipes, etc. at dramatically reduced costs. The advanced algorithms and workflows used resulted in a 100-fold increase in efficiency and delivered results in two days compared to what could take several months using generally available open-source deep learning AI workflows and software. Future direction of development is to validate against excavation-/drill-bit-/inline-tool-based ground truth and further extend and develop this process to deliver near real-time results.

The applicability of DM includes several areas such as education, healthcare, business, and finance. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an interdisciplinary domain which focuses on the applicability of DM, machine learning (ML), and statistical approaches for pattern recognition in massive quantities of educational data. This type of data suffers from the curse of dimensionality problems. Thus, feature selection (FS) approaches become essential. This study designs a Feature Subset Selection with an optimal machine learning model for Educational Data Mining (FSSML‐EDM). The proposed method involves three major processes. At the initial stage, the presented FSSML‐EDM model uses the Chicken Swarm Optimization‐based Feature Selection (CSO‐FS) technique for electing feature subsets. Next, an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier is employed for the classification of educational data. Finally, the Artificial Hum-mingbird (AHB) algorithm is utilized for adjusting the parameters involved in the ELM model. The performance study revealed that FSSML‐EDM model achieves better results compared with other models under several dimensions. © 2022 by the authors.

AI isn’t a futuristic concept; it is already here, and it is being implemented in a range of industries. Finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities are all examples of this. There are countless examples of AI having a substantial impact on the world and complementing human abilities. However, due to the immense societal ramifications of these technologies, AI is on the verge of disrupting a host of industries, so the technique by which AI systems are created must be better understood. The goal of the study was to look at what it meant to be human-centred, how to create human-centred, and what considerations should be made for human-centred AI to achieve sustainability and the SDGs. Using a systematic literature review technique, the study discovered that a human-centred AI strategy strives to create and implement AI systems in ways that benefit mankind and serve their interests. The study also found that a human-in-the-loop concept should be used to develop procedures for creating human-centred AI, as well as other initiatives, such as the promotion of AI accountability, encouraging businesses to use autonomy wisely, to motivate businesses to be aware of human and algorithmic biases, to ensure that businesses prioritize customers, and form multicultural teams to tackle AI research. The study concluded with policy recommendations for human-centred AI to help accomplish the SDGs, including expanding government AI investments, addressing data and algorithm biases, and resolving data access issues, among other things. © 2022 by the author.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey, 1.4 million people have died, and 50 million people have been injured worldwide every year. The key cause of death is the unavailability of medical care at the accident site or the high response time in the rescue operation. A cognitive agent-based collision detection smart accident alert and rescue system will help us to minimize delays in a rescue operation that could save many lives. With the growing popularity of smart cities, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are drawing major interest in academia and business, and are considered as a means to improve road safety in smart cities. This article proposed an intelligent accident detection and rescue system which mimics the cognitive functions of the human mind using the Internet of Things (IoTs) and the Artificial Intelligence system (AI). An IoT kit is developed that detects the accident and collects all accident-related information, such as position, pressure, gravitational force, speed, etc., and sends it to the cloud. In the cloud, once the accident is detected, a deep learning (DL) model is used to validate the output of the IoT module and activate the rescue module. Once the accident is detected by the DL module, all the closest emergency services such as the hospital, police station, mechanics, etc., are notified. Ensemble transfer learning with dynamic weights is used to minimize the false detection rate. Due to the dataset’s unavailability, a personalized dataset is generated from the various videos available on the Internet. The proposed method is validated by a comparative analysis of ResNet and InceptionResnetV2. The experiment results show that InceptionResnetV2 provides a better performance compared to ResNet with training, validation, and a test accuracy of 98%, respectively. To measure the performance of the proposed approach in the real world, it is validated on the toy car. © 2022 by the authors.

In recent years, federated learning (FL) is proposed to attack the challenges of learning shared models collaboratively while protecting security based on the data from cross-domain clients. However, data in the real environment is usually not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) due to the differences in business, working environments, and data acquisition, and thus classic federated methods suffer from significant performance degradation. In this paper, a novel federated framework is proposed for secure textile fiber identification (FedTFI) via cross-domain texture representation based on high-definition fabric images. In addition to sharing the gradient of FedTFI, the local patch of feature maps between cross-domain clients is randomly exchanged to build a richer image texture feature distribution while protecting data security simultaneously for secure computing. Furthermore, a texture embedding layer is designed to provide a joint representation through similarity measure between triplet samples in low-dimensional space. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, two textile image datasets, i.e., one public and the other we collected, are utilized to construct four Non-IID scenarios, including label skew, feature skew, and two combined skew scenarios. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our model to obtain better detection accuracies than benchmarks in four Non-IID scenarios by keeping data privacy for secure computing in fabric IIoT. © 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","federated learning; image classification; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); machine vision; Non-IID; secure computing; texture encoding","Computer vision; Cryptography; Data acquisition; Data privacy; Encoding (symbols); Image texture; Internet of things; Learning systems; Signal encoding; Textiles; Textures; Cross-domain; Feature map; Federated learning; Images classification; Industrial internet of thing; Local feature; Machine-vision; Not independent and identically distributed; Secure computing; Texture encoding; Image classification",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132981698

In comparison with traditional insurance, AI and machine learning have altered the way insurers create health insurance policies and helped consumers receive services faster. Insurance businesses use ML to provide clients with accurate, quick, and efficient health insurance coverage. This research trained and evaluated an artificial intelligence network-based regression-based model to predict health insurance premiums.

Using Google Assistant – an artificial intelligence-driven virtual assistant – as a case study, we argue that these rules are overreaching and difficult to apply in the present-day information society and Internet of Things environments. First, as a consequence of recent developments in case law and supervisory guidance, these rules lead to a complex and ambiguous test to determine (joint) control. Second, due to advances in technological applications and business models, it is increasingly challenging to apply such rules to contemporary processing operations. In particular, as illustrated by the Google Assistant, individuals will likely be qualified as joint controllers, together with Google and also third-party developers, for at least the collection and possible transmission of other individuals’ personal data via the virtual assistant. Third, we identify follow-on issues relating to the apportionment of responsibilities between joint controllers and the effective and complete protection of data subjects.

This paper briefly explains AI and looks into the future to highlight some of AI's broader and longer-term societal implications. We propose that AI can be combined with entrepreneurship to represent a super tool. Scholars can research the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship to explore the possibilities of this potential AI-entrepreneurship super tool and hopefully direct its use to productive processes and outcomes. We focus on specific entrepreneurship topics that benefit from AI's augmentation potential and acknowledge implications for entrepreneurship's dark side. We hope this paper stimulates future research at the AI-entrepreneurship nexus. Executive summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines that are trained to perform tasks associated with human intelligence, interpret external data, learn from that external data, and use that learning to flexibly adapt to tasks to achieve specific outcomes. Machine learning is the most common form of AI and largely relies on supervised learning—when the machine (i.e., AI) is trained with labels applied by humans. Deep learning and adversarial learning involve training on unlabeled data, or when the machine (via its algorithms) clusters data to reveal underlying patterns. AI is simply a tool. Entrepreneurship is also simply a tool. How they are combined and used will determine their impact on humanity. While researchers have independently developed a greater understanding of entrepreneurship and AI, these two streams of research have primarily run in parallel. To indicate the scope of current and future AI, we provide examples of AI (at different levels of development) for four sectors—customer service, financial, healthcare, and tertiary education. Indeed, experts from industry research and consulting firms suggest many AI-related business opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue. Further, we elaborate on several of these opportunities, including opportunities to (1) capitalize on the “feeling economy,” (2) redistribute occupational skills in the economy, (3) develop and use new governance mechanisms, (4) keep humans in the loop (i.e., humans as part of the decision making process), (5) expand the role of humans in developing AI systems, and (6) expand the purposes of AI as a tool. After discussing the range of business opportunities that experts suggest will prevail in the economy with AI, we discuss how entrepreneurs can use AI as a tool to help them increase their chances of entrepreneurial success. We focus on four up-and-coming areas for entrepreneurship research: a more interaction-based perspective of (potential) entrepreneurial opportunities, a more activities-based micro-foundation approach to entrepreneurial action, a more cognitively hot perspective of entrepreneurial decision making and action, and a more compassionate and prosocial role of entrepreneurial action. As we discuss each topic, we also suggest opportunities to design an AI system (i.e., entrepreneurs as potential AI designers) to help entrepreneurs (i.e., entrepreneurs as AI users). AI is an exciting development in the technology world. How it transforms markets and societies depends in large part on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs can use AI to augment their decisions and actions in pursuing potential opportunities for productive gains. Thus, we discuss entrepreneurs' most critical tasks in developing and managing AI and explore some of the dark-side aspects of AI. Scholars also have a role to play in how entrepreneurs use AI, but this role requires the hard work of theory building, theory elaboration, theory testing, and empirical theorizing. We offer some AI topics that we hope future entrepreneurship research will explore. We hope this paper encourages scholars to consider research at the nexus of AI and entrepreneurship. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Entrepreneurship; Machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130404734

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda. Research on the theme is relevant and urgent for the fashion business, which is still in its infancy. Work on the agenda topics could benefit distinct fashion stakeholders, not just customers, and produce well-grounded decision-making in varied FRSC contexts and dynamics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Customer model; Decision support systems; Fashion; Retail supply chain; User model","Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Online systems; Sales; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Customer preferences; Customer-modeling; Decision supports; Decisions makings; E- commerces; Fashion; Online retails; Retail supply chain; Social sustainability; User Modelling; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129897941

Addressing this gap, the objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of CE application in the aerospace industry. This research makes two contributions to the field. Firstly, the CE-related practices applicable to the aerospace industry were identified and analyzed. Secondly, the main practices were evaluated in three companies that develop and manufacture aerospace products in the global scenario, resulting in a guidance framework of CE practices for the aerospace industry. Among the main findings, it was observed that: (i) financial benefits have stimulated companies towards the application of circular strategies; (ii) ethanol has been used as an alternative and renewable fuel; (iii) several materials are reused and recycled in this and in different industrial sectors; and (iv) the use of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, drones and additive manufacturing drive CE in the aerospace industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aerospace industry; Circular business models; Digital transformation; Sustainable design","air transportation; design; environmental economics; manufacturing; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129792829

We test and confirm the hypothesis that AI rather than ML attracts more positive sentiments in the marketplace. Additionally, we find that AI is mostly used when the discussion centers on innovativeness, and that discussions concerning collaboration in these technologies attract more positive sentiments. We further contribute methodologically by leveraging textual data available online on the titles of web-page contents and the results of the Vader sentiment analysis to test our hypothesis.

Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks.

Many of these businesses rely on word-of-mouth marketing, delivering business cards to customers. Furthermore, the lack of a dedicated marketing team and budget for brand image consolidation and design creation often limits the brand expansion capability. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel system prototype that can suggest personalized designs for business cards, based on an existing business card picture. Using perspective transformation, text extraction and colour reduction techniques, we were able to obtain features from the original business card image and generate an alternative design, personalized for the end user. We have successfully been able to generate customized business cards for different business types, with textual information and a custom colour palette matching the original submitted image.

We offer a theoretical contribution to consider AI ethics outside of high-level and top-down approaches, based on the distinction between “reality” and “world” from Luc Boltanski. To do so, we provide a new perspective on the debate on AI fairness and show that criticism of ML unfairness is “realist”, in other words, grounded in an already instituted reality based on demographic categories produced by institutions. Second, we show that the limits of “realist” fairness corrections lead to the elaboration of “radical responses” to fairness, that is, responses that radically change the format of data. Third, we show that fairness correction is shifting to a “domination regime” that absorbs criticism, and we provide some theoretical and practical avenues for further development in AI ethics. Using an ad hoc critical space stabilized by reality tests alongside the algorithm, we build a shared responsibility model which is compatible with the radical response to fairness issues. Finally, this paper shows the fundamental contribution of pragmatic sociology theories, insofar as they afford a social and political perspective on AI ethics by giving an active role to material actors such as database formats on ethical debates. In a context where data are increasingly numerous, granular, and behavioral, it is essential to renew our conception of AI ethics on algorithms in order to establish new models of responsibility for companies that take into account changes in the computing paradigm. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Business ethics; Fairness; Machine learning; Pragmatic sociology; Responsibility model",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125255555

This study uses data-driven analysis to clarify circular supply chain trends and opportunities in practice. A valid hierarchical circular supply chain structure is composed of a big dataset. However, the attributes of the hierarchical circular supply chain structure must be explored to identify the opportunities and challenges of the circular supply chain. A combination of data-driven content and cluster analysis, including the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy decision-making trials, evaluation laboratories, and the entropy weight method, is utilized to address this gap. The study analyzes a set of five attributes from the literature, and 23 criteria are validated.

Although AI represents extraordinary opportunities for businesses, companies must avoid the dangers and risks associated with the adoption of such systems. Integrating perspectives from emerging research on AI, morality of machines, and norm activation, we examine how individuals morally behave toward AI agents and self-service machines. Across three studies, we demonstrate that consumers’ moral concerns and behaviors differ when interacting with technologies versus humans. We show that moral intention (intention to report an error) is less likely to emerge for AI checkout and self-checkout machines compared with human checkout. In addition, moral intention decreases as people consider the machine less humanlike. We further document that the decline in morality is caused by less guilt displayed toward new technologies.

The broad spectrum of potential ethical issues pertains to using driverless cars, AI robots in care homes, and in the military, such as Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems. However, there is a scarcity of in-depth theoretical, methodological, or empirical studies that address these ethical issues, for instance, the impact of morality and where accountability resides in AI robots’ use. To address this dearth, this study offers a conceptual framework that interpretively develops the ethical implications of AI robot applications, drawing on descriptive and normative ethical theory. The new framework elaborates on how the locus of morality (human to AI agency) and moral intensity combine within context-specific AI robot applications, and how this might influence accountability thinking. Our theorization indicates that in situations of escalating AI agency and situational moral intensity, accountability is widely dispersed between actors and institutions. ‘Accountability clusters’ are outlined to illustrate interrelationships between the locus of morality, moral intensity, and accountability and how these invoke different categorical responses: (i) illegal, (ii) immoral, (iii) permissible, and (iv) supererogatory pertaining to using AI robots. These enable discussion of the ethical implications of using AI robots, and associated accountability challenges for a constellation of actors—from designer, individual/organizational users to the normative and regulative approaches of industrial/governmental bodies and intergovernmental regimes. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accountability; AI robots; Artificial intelligence; Descriptive ethical theory; Locus of morality; Moral intensity; Normative ethical theory",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124719639

This paper aims to extend previous studies analyzing social media reviews through text mining and sentiment analysis to provide useful recommendations for management in the restaurant industry. Design/methodology/approach: The Lexalytics, a text mining artificial intelligence tool, is applied to analyze the text of the online reviews of the restaurants in a touristic Dutch village extracted from the most frequently used social media platforms focusing on the four restaurant quality factors, namely, food and beverage, service, atmosphere and value. Findings: The findings of this research are presented by the identified key themes with comparisons of the customers’ review sentiment between a selected restaurant, Zwaantje, vis-à-vis its bench-mark restaurants set by a specific approach under the abovementioned quality dimensions, in which the food and beverage and service are the most commented by customers. Results demonstrate that text mining can generate insights from different aspects and that the proposed approach is valuable to restaurant management. Originality/value: The paper provides a relatively big scale in numbers and resources of social media reviews to further explore the most important service dimensions in the restaurant industry in a specific tourist area.

In recent years, nature-inspired metaheuristics are proved to be robust solvers for global optimization problems. Hybridization is a commonly used technique that can further improve metaheuristic algorithms. Hybrid algorithms are designed by combining the advantages of various algorithms, which produce a synergistic effect. Hybridization results in intensifying specific advantages in different algorithms and the hybridized algorithm implementation often performs better than the original version. In this paper, we present the hybridized artificial flora optimization algorithm, named genetically guided best artificial flora. This hybridization is achieved by using a uniform crossover and mutation operators from the genetic algorithms that facilitate exploration of the search space and make the right balance between diversification and intensification. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid algorithm is adopted for two real-world problems, artificial neural network training, and feature selection problem. Following good practice, proposed method was first tested on standard unconstrained functions before it was evaluated for these two very important machine learning challenges. The experimental results show that the proposed hybridized algorithm is highly competitive and that it establishes a better balance between exploration and exploitation than the original one and that it is superior over other state-of-the-art methods in artificial neural network training and feature selection. © 2021, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association.","Artificial flora algorithm; Artificial neural network; Feature selection; Hybridized algorithms; Optimization; Swarm intelligence","Biomimetics; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Neural networks; Personnel training; Polynomial approximation; Swarm intelligence; Artificial flora algorithm; Features selection; Hybrid algorithms; Hybridisation; Hybridized algorithms; Neural network features; Neural networks trainings; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Feature extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118582648

AI-powered social bots can sense, think and act on social media platforms in ways similar to humans. The challenge is that social bots can perform many harmful actions, such as providing wrong information to people, escalating arguments, perpetrating scams and exploiting the stock market. As such, an understanding of different kinds of social bots and their authors’ intentions is vital from the management perspective. Drawing from the actor-network theory (ANT), this study investigates human and non-human actors’ roles in social media, particularly Twitter.

The authors elaborate on the three different sectors in this industry namely upstream, midstream, and downstream. Herein, a review is presented to evaluate the applications and scope of machine learning in the oil and gas industry to optimize the upstream operations (including exploration, drilling, reservoir, and production), midstream operations (including transportation using pipelines, ships, and road vehicles), and downstream operations (including production of refinery products like fuels, lubricants, and plastics). Enhanced processing of seismic data is illustrated which provides the industry with a better understanding of machine learning applications. Basing on the investigation of AI implementation prospects and the survey of subsisting implementations, they diagram the latest patterns in creating AI-based instruments and distinguish their impacts on speeding up and de-gambling measures in the business. They examine AI proposition and calculations, just as the job and accessibility of information in the portion. Furthermore, they examine the principal non-specialized difficulties that forestall the concentrated use of man-made brainpower in the oil and gas industry (OGI), identified with information, individuals, and new types of joint effort.

This paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Harry Kloor is a successful serial entrepreneur, scientist, technologist, educator, policy advisor, author and Hollywood filmmaker. He is the CEO and co-founder of Beyond Imagination, a company that has developed a suite of exponential technology solutions that deploys artificial intelligence (AI), AR, robotics, machine learning and human–computer interaction technology to enhance and revolutionize the world’s workforce. The company early in 2021 completed BEOMNI 1.0, the world’s first fully functional humanoid robotic system with an AI evolving brain, enabling remote work at a high level of fidelity to be done from around the globe. Kloor describes how he transformed his childhood dream into his brainchild and tangible reality. Findings: Kloor was born a groundbreaker who did not take no for an answer. He was born partially crippled with his legs facing backwards. The doctors said that he would spend his life in braces and would never be able to run. His parents told him not to let those ideas limit him and by the age of seven he ran for the first time and went on to become a martial arts master. Kloor’s childhood dream was to create ways to leave his body and inhabit a robotic body so that he could physically be free from his limited mobility. Kloor built his first computer at the age of seven and invented his first product at the age of eight. Kloor's inspiration to study science came largely from science fiction and his 20,000-plus collection of comic books. Knowing the nature of exponential growth, he spent the next 40 years building the expertise, relationships, networks and experience in all areas of exponential technology. Kloor obtained a BA from Southern Oregon State College, an MEd from Southern Oregon University and two simultaneous PhDs, one in chemistry and one in physics, from Purdue University. Kloor co-founded the company Universal Consultants, where he served as chief science consultant, providing guidance to clients in the development of new technological products, patents and policy positions. Kloor was the founder of Stem CC Inc. – a stem cell company that was sold in 2018 to Celularity, one of the world’s most cutting edge clinical-stage cell therapeutics company. Kloor is also the founder and president of Jupiter 9 Productions and is a credited film writer, director and producer. Since his graduation from Purdue University, he has written for Star Trek: Voyager and was the story editor for Gene Roddenberry’s Earth: Final Conflict, a series he co-created/developed. Kloor helped create Taiwan’s animation industry, bringing Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey, the first big animation film that starred major Hollywood stars, to Taiwan. Kloor also sits on the board of Brain Mapping and Therapeutics Society and serves as their Chief Scientific Advisor and Educational Outreach Coordinator. Originality/value: Kloor is a “creative consultant and universal problem solver, with an emphasis in technology and education.” Kloor has worked with Dr Peter Diamandis since the first class of the International Space University in 1988. Kloor was one of the five founding team members of XPRIZE serving as its CSO until 2005 and was one of the founders of the Rocket Racing League. He was on the founding team of Singularity University and taught at Singularity’s first summer program. In 2016 he created the $10m Avatar XPRIZE, and in 2018 he co-created the Carbon Extraction XPRIZE which obtained the largest incentive prize in history, a $100m, funded by Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation. Kloor is the only person in world history to earn two PhDs simultaneously in two distinct academic disciplines. In recognition of this achievement, he was named ABC World News’ Person of the Week in August 1994. Kloor has received numerous awards, including The Golden Axon Award from the Society for Brain Mapping & Therapeutics. He has recently created the Kloor Cycle, a four-stage experiential autonomous learning process within Beomni’s “AI Brain,” adapted from Kolb’s Learning Cycles. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Haptic devices; Humanoid robots; Medical robots; Neural networks; Teleoperation","Anthropomorphic robots; Engineering education; Helium; Human computer interaction; Intelligent robots; Neural networks; Commercialized products; Exponentials; Haptic devices; Hollywood; Humanoid robot; Medical robots; Neural-networks; Personal experience; Purdue University; Robotic industry; Human robot interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132766080

Cultivating the entrepreneurship of college students is not only a response to the national call, but also a basic requirement for implementing quality education and promoting the comprehensive development of college students. To better study the entrepreneurship of college students, cultivate a group of newcomers of the era who have patriotic feelings, dare to innovate, hardworking and sustainable struggle, and solve the problem of college students' employment difficulties from the root, the cultivation mode of college students' entrepreneurship is studied. Firstly, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on social ethics is analyzed. Secondly, it analyzes the current situation of the cultivation of science and engineering college students' entrepreneurship from three aspects: Chinese traditional cultural thoughts influence the concept of career choice, enterprises emphasize utilitarianism, and colleges and universities attach importance to knowledge education and despise spiritual education. Finally, the data statistics on the cultivation of entrepreneurship of science and engineering college students are carried out in the form of questionnaires. The results demonstrate that among the students surveyed, 21.31% have a strong willingness to start their own business, and 72.84% have the idea of starting their own business, which means that most students still want to start a business through their own efforts, not blindly looking for jobs. Simultaneously, among many majors, 87.5% of students majoring in agriculture and medicine are better at finding new ways to solve problems, while the proportion of students majoring in literature and history is the lowest. It also indicates that most students believe that schools should add more seminar courses, internship courses, design courses, experimental courses, etc., and allow students to choose learning courses across colleges and majors, to cultivate college students' entrepreneurship.

The increasing adoption of AI is generating technological turbulence in the business environment. Previous studies have also shown that employees are aware of the high risk of losing their jobs when being replaced by AI. The risk of employees engaging in opportunistic behaviors, such as knowledge hiding, is thus fairly high. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the mediating effect of employee’s AI awareness on the relationship between technological turbulence generated by AI and the three types of knowledge hiding: evasive hiding, playing dumb and rationalized hiding. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equations by the partial least squares method were used to test the proposed research model. Findings: The most interesting finding is that employee’s AI and robotics awareness fulfills almost all mediating functions in the relationship between technological turbulence generated by AI and the three types of knowledge hiding. Originality/value: The results show that knowledge hiding in the digital age is first and foremost a strategy by employees to sabotage and induce failure in process automation, to reduce the risk of being replaced in the workplace by AI. This study indicates that employees are willing to hide knowledge in all possible ways when perception that AI is a threat to their job increases. In other words, technological turbulence generated by AI and employee’s AI awareness are the two great new triggers of knowledge hiding in the digital age. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counterproductive knowledge behavior; Digital transformation; Employee’s artificial intelligence awareness; Intelligent process automation; Knowledge hiding; Transaction cost theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113726376

This is due to the agility of most QSR brands in adapting to consumer needs, quality food products and service innovation. Offering the convenience of brands reach for their consumers such as a restaurant within the reach of the customer, as well as providing online ordering and food delivery convenience. The convenience of the omnichannel digital services offered by typical QSR restaurant brands to their customer provides convenience for service delivery and at the same time provides an opportunity to collect, collate, check, consume and analyse the data to examine, explore and provide hindsight, insight and foresight for the QSR industry to be ahead of the competition. Not only are these digital customer channels a great way of providing a better customer experience, but they also help QSR operators in capturing massive data such as sales transactions, customer details, product performance, and daypart (breakfast, lunch and dinner) sales insights. With the ability to analyse and perform analytics on the data and from a data strategy perspective, it is paramount to have a robust big data platform, data warehouse and ability to consolidate data from all the IT systems. This is to enable the development of BI/dashboards to provide better business insights, such as real-time and daypart product sales. Data could also be used to develop new digital products for more positive customer engagements such as upselling and loyalty programmes or for implementing of ""smart kitchen""that is able to connect various datasets for maximum kitchen efficiency and cost optimisation. Due to a lack of data science approach and machine learning capability, most QSR brands are missing this sales uplifting opportunity. To develop an effective A.I. and machine learning in the QSR business, there is a need to evaluate and select the best machine learning techniques to address the business challenges. Our objective is to explore and recommend the various machine learning techniques that can be applied to the QSR industry to gain insights and provide the necessary analysis and analytics to ensure quality service and also address changing business challenges in the competitive and ever-changing market by deploying various machine learning models for prediction and pattern analysis through classification and association approaches. © 2022 ACM.","Association; Big Data; Classification; Data Analytics; Data Management; Data Warehousing; Information systems applications Data Mining; Machine Learning; Prediction","Big data; Classification (of information); Commerce; Competition; Data mining; Data warehouses; Information management; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Market Research; Quality control; Sales; Application data; Business challenges; Consumer's needs; Data analytics; Information system application data mining; Information systems application; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Market researches; Product and service innovations; Data Analytics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139919797

More recently, it has also been profoundly impacting the computational science and engineering domains, like geoscience, climate science, and health science. In these domains, users need to perform comprehensive data analyses combining scientific data and ML models to provide for critical requirements, such as reproducibility, model explainability, and experiment data understanding. However, scientific ML is multidisciplinary, heterogeneous, and affected by the physical constraints of the domain, making such analyses even more challenging.

In the simplest sense, AI is a branch of intelligence involved in constructing intelligent machines that can be used for work that usually requires human understanding. Human resources management plays a vital role in the company's management and generally encompasses people and their behaviour. HR policies are a set of guidelines for the organisation's management of its staff. Today, HR managers must examine the skills and talents required by employee artificial intelligence in different departments. The problem identified here is that human limitations, such as biases, preconceptions, and time restrictions, can prevent an HRM process's effectiveness. This is a problem because it can lead an organisation to lose its job and monetary value candidates.

During this process, the expectations of the enterprises can create sustainable innovations that will have a competitive advantage in the market in which they play a role. From this point of view, innovation is considered an important resource that will bring high returns and competitiveness to businesses. Moreover, innovation is also evaluated as a rapid development indicator of small businesses and family businesses. Entrepreneurial leaders have the ability to analyse the environment well, and are role models for employees. Entrepreneurial leaders ensure that innovation is a sustainable competence within the organisation. On the other hand, making the necessary preparations for the adaptation of the employees who resist in situations where change is needed, and explaining the necessity of change are an issue that entrepreneurial leaders emphasise. In addition, the concept of innovation climate, which enables innovation to be an organisational element, is also significant for the evolvement of the innovation in the workplace. The role of leadership in creating an innovation climate and adapting it to the organisational structure has a major role on businesses performance.

Despite increased attention to business model research, the understanding of business models’ impact on entrepreneurial development is quite constrained. In particular, the question of how an entrepreneurial firm’s business model is influenced by its organizational members’ managerial cognition remains under-explored. To tackle this research question, we drew a linkage between the business model literature and a managerial cognition perspective to build the theoretical foundation. We used this theoretical lens to investigate the failure of Better Place, an Israeli entrepreneurial company that focused on its proprietary battery-swap electric vehicles. In our findings, we argued that organizational members’ managerial-cognition-based conceptual framework is critical to the business model decision-making of an entrepreneurial firm. The discrepant and strongly held conceptual framework may result in misjudgment of environmental changes, especially when emerging-market numbers in an industry are high, and consensus regarding technology innovation in an industry is still lacking. The improper conceptual framework can generate mistaken business models, which further bring about an organizational decline. It is crucial for entrepreneurial firms to learn and improve existing conceptual frameworks and consequent business models by business interaction in the initiative stage if they are to avoid failure.

In the 20th century it was believed that stable development is impossible, if the company focuses its production on the preservation and protection of the environment. Since the second half of the 20th century, ideas have been increasingly heard that sustainable economic development cannot be achieved at the expense of the predatory depletion of natural resources. The environmental agenda plays an important role in the ESG principles, largely formulated by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, reflected in Sustainable Development Goals 12–15, reflected in Resolution 70/1 - Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Companies such as Tesla Motors, called “green giants”, have proven by their experience and development dynamics that in today’s environment a business that does not have a negative impact on the environment can be profitable and successful. Thus, modern trends in the development of the world economy determine the relevance of the present study, aimed at studying the new conditions of economic activity by enterprises - the conditions of smart ecology and development of recommendations for the effective transformation of enterprises under these conditions. The purpose of this study is to analyze and identify the main problems of sustainable development of enterprises in terms of preservation and protection of the environment - “smart ecology”, and based on the formulated problems the authors have developed ways to overcome them. The subject of the study are managerial and other relationships arising during the implementation of innovative Smart projects by enterprises. Methods: In the process of analyzing the problems and developing ways to overcome them and the transition of enterprises to the conditions of smart ecology, the authors used methods of system analysis, methods of statistical analysis, methods of artificial intelligence. Results: The conducted analysis shows that in modern conditions of development of innovative technologies in Russia there is no unified approach to the process of effective management of breakthrough development projects. The analysis proposed the concept of SMART ecology and showed its importance for understanding the processes taking place in the modern world. Factors influencing the effectiveness of the implementation of innovative smart ecology projects have been identified. Methods that can be used during the implementation of these projects were proposed.

Model quality is crucial for such research. At present, inter-organizational business process (IOBP) has been widely used in the model design and development of the distributed system. Before implementing the intelligent analysis of the IOBP model, conformance as a foundation for model quality checking plays a key role because it ensures in advance that the participants can successfully interact without violating the global communication constraints imposed by the choreography. In fact, the multi-instance participant is a common requirement in IOBP. This paper provides a formal approach and framework supporting the conformance between BPMN choreography and collaboration while considering multi-instance participants and message communication modes. As a core, the formalization proposed is based on BNF syntax and structured CSP# processes. It can well support multi-instance features and multiple communication modes. Combined with CSP#, the formal definitions of communication modes and verification properties are given. On this basis, an integrated framework is provided to support automated formal verification referring to multiple communication modes. Finally, a set of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Artificial intelligence; BPMN; communication mode; conformance; inter-organizational business process; multi-instance","Artificial intelligence; Formal verification; BPMN; Communication mode; Conformance; Interorganizational business process; Model development; Modeling analyzes; Modeling designs; Modeling quality; Multi-instance; Process-models; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129899810

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a content and thematic analysis of 325 academic sources extracted from the Scopus database and 683 patents retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) dataset. Additionally, the research applies the Kruskal–Wallis test as a non-parametric test for evaluating differences in the main concepts discussed in the two sources. Findings: The academic and practitioners' debate highlights a trading zone among the two streams. patents' analysis from the EPO reveals four main common themes as a new business that benefits from AI in weather predictions, new smart and intelligent ways to monitor crops, new businesses that use clouds to control plant's humidity. The analysis of Scopus's sources demonstrates theoretical approaches related to the technology acceptance model (TAM) and practical strategies in terms of entrepreneurial skills to support the agricultural sector. However, barriers among the two streams of sources exist in innovation management and scale-up entrepreneurial initiatives. Research limitations/implications: Regarding implications, the authors aim to connect academic and practitioners' views by understanding the new potential innovation applications and the connected new research avenues. Limitations might arise from the sources used to develop our analysis. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it investigates the issues arising from the relationship between AE and new technologies by examining original validated patents released by practitioners and approved by the EPO, rather than reviewing blogs or the financial press. This leads to a holistic understanding of the impact of tangible practices among agricultural entrepreneurs. The results support the view that new trading zones and case studies are needed to highlight and show the positive impact of technologies in this field. The authors argue that practitioners require scholars to reduce the ambiguity between AE and its expected results, leading to investments to boost new agricultural business ideas. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural entrepreneurship; Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Big data; Content analysis; Machine learning","article; artificial intelligence; augmented reality; big data; blogging; content analysis; crop; entrepreneurship; human; humidity; investment; Kruskal Wallis test; machine learning; nonhuman; nonparametric test; patent; physician; prediction; scale up; Scopus; skill; thematic analysis; theoretical study; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121743237

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enable or inhibit transitions to sustainability, due to its capacity to facilitate transformational change and disruption. Thus, AI can have major impacts on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those related to food systems. This paper focuses on critically exploring different aspects during the implementation of a software project in US schools that used AI techniques to enable agility and provide healthy food options for schoolchildren. Participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis were used to inform the case study and uncover the new processes developed using the technology. As a key barrier to the effective management of school food programs and nutrition is the administrative load associated with statutory compliance, this case study demonstrates the difference that AI-powered tools can make in alleviating the weight of administrative processes. An Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled boundary spanning framework is used to extend the case study toward an analysis of the systems, boundaries, relationships and perspectives which starts mapping the areas where the private sector, public institutions and civil society can meet to fast-track sustainable transition activities, particularly in the context of food systems. This article presents some possible approaches to facilitating these activities, inviting policy makers to bridge the gap with businesses and use business agility to support common societal goals to achieve sustainable food systems.

At other times, as the global pandemic showed us, it happens without warning. Either way, traditional marketing tactics have no place in modern customer experiences (CX). So how can brands build trust and develop deeper relationships through ever-changing sentiment or market conditions? They need to show customers that they understand their unique situation and can provide tangible value. Marketing and customer engagement practitioners can achieve true one-to-one engagement with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered, ‘always-on’ models that continuously engage customers during calculated ‘moments of need’. Legacy marketing techniques will no longer be sustainable in a rapidly evolving business landscape riddled with data constraints, regulatory challenges and labour shortages. Organisations need to move away from data silos and channel-specific strategies and instead rely on a single ‘brain’ that helps orchestrate engagement with each customer. Brands can survive only by moving beyond sales and mixing additional messages that support retention, service, nurture and resilience actions into their marketing framework; only then can they deliver truly personalised customer experiences across channels while always remaining sensitive to their circumstances. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.","artificial intelligence; customer experience; data; empathy; empathy; marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135467446

However, strategies and practical experiences surrounding the adoption and implementation of AI in health care are lacking. This is likely because of the high implementation complexity of AI, legacy IT infrastructure, and unclear business cases, thus complicating AI adoption. Research has recently started to identify the factors influencing AI readiness of organizations. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing AI readiness as well as possible barriers to AI adoption and implementation in German hospitals. We also assessed the status quo regarding the dissemination of AI tools in hospitals. We focused on IT decision makers, a seldom studied but highly relevant group. Methods: We created a web-based survey based on recent AI readiness and implementation literature. Participants were identified through a publicly accessible database and contacted via email or invitational leaflets sent by mail, in some cases accompanied by a telephonic prenotification. The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: We contacted 609 possible participants, and our database recorded 40 completed surveys. Most participants agreed or rather agreed with the statement that AI would be relevant in the future, both in Germany (37/40, 93%) and in their own hospital (36/40, 90%). Participants were asked whether their hospitals used or planned to use AI technologies. Of the 40 participants, 26 (65%) answered “yes.” Most AI technologies were used or planned for patient care, followed by biomedical research, administration, and logistics and central purchasing. The most important barriers to AI were lack of resources (staff, knowledge, and financial). Relevant possible opportunities for using AI were increase in efficiency owing to time-saving effects, competitive advantages, and increase in quality of care. Most AI tools in use or in planning have been developed with external partners. Conclusions: Few tools have been implemented in routine care, and many hospitals do not use or plan to use AI in the future. This can likely be explained by missing or unclear business cases or the need for a modern IT infrastructure to integrate AI tools in a usable manner. These shortcomings complicate decision-making and resource attribution. As most AI technologies already in use were developed in cooperation with external partners, these relationships should be fostered. IT decision makers should assess their hospitals’ readiness for AI individually with a focus on resources. Further research should continue to monitor the dissemination of AI tools and readiness factors to determine whether improvements can be made over time. This monitoring is especially important with regard to government-supported investments in AI technologies that could alleviate financial burdens. Qualitative studies with hospital IT decision makers should be conducted to further explore the reasons for slow AI. © Lina Weinert, Julia Müller, Laura Svensson, Oliver Heinze.","AI readiness; artificial intelligence; decision-making; descriptive analysis; implementation; quantitative study",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133528195

On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since then, a group of new COVID-19 variants has emerged posing a greater danger to humanity. By the start of August 2021, the reported COVID-19 related death toll across the globe has rocketed to 4,233,139. To deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the world have rushed to develop various techniques in order to embrace an array of solutions to the problem. Covid-19 negatively affected countries in several sectors including industry, business, health, and education to name a few. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are among the top countries which use cutting-edge technologies in several sectors. This significantly helped these countries to overcome the spread of this virus. In this paper, we present an overview of the technologies, techniques, solutions, and strategies deployed by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in order to safeguard their citizens and speedy return of life to normalcy © 2022.

PPM provides useful predictions on the future of the running business processes with respect to different perspectives, such as the upcoming activities to be executed next, the final execution outcome, and performance indicators. In the context of PPM, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are widely employed. In order to gain trust of stakeholders regarding the reliability of PPM predictions, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods have been increasingly used to compensate for the lack of transparency of most of predictive models. Multiple XAI methods exist providing explanations for almost all types of ML models. However, for the same data, as well as, under the same preprocessing settings or same ML models, generated explanations often vary significantly. Corresponding variations might jeopardize the consistency and robustness of the explanations and, subsequently, the utility of the corresponding model and pipeline settings. This paper introduces a framework that enables the analysis of the impact PPM-related settings and ML-model-related choices may have on the characteristics and expressiveness of the generated explanations. Our framework provides a means to examine explanations generated either for the whole reasoning process of an ML model, or for the predictions made on the future of a certain business process instance. Using well-defined experiments with different settings, we uncover how choices made through a PPM workflow affect and can be reflected through explanations. This framework further provides the means to compare how different characteristics of explainability methods can shape the resulting explanations and reflect on the underlying model reasoning process. © 2022 by the authors.

Diagnosis of CD is based on the evaluation of symptoms and anti-transglutaminase antibodies IgA (TGA-IgA) levels, with values above a tenfold increase being the basis of the biopsy-free diagnostic approach suggested by present guidelines. This study showcased the largest screening project for CD carried out to date in school children (n=20,000) aimed at assessing the diagnostic accuracy of minimally invasive finger prick point-of-care tests (POCT) which, combined with conventional celiac serology and the aid of an artificial intelligence-based system, may eliminate the need for intestinal biopsy. Moreover, this study delves deeper into the “coeliac iceberg” in an attempt to identify people with disorders who may benefit from a gluten-free diet, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, abnormal serology and histology. This was achieved by looking for TGA-IgA mucosal deposits in duodenal biopsy. This large European multidisciplinary health project paves the way to an improved quality of life for patients by reducing the costs for diagnosis due to delayed findings of CD and to offer business opportunities in terms of diagnostic tools and support. © 2022 by the authors.

In the same way, deep learning techniques are also used to develop software and techniques that pose a danger to privacy, democracy, and national security. Fake content in the form of images and videos using digital manipulation with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches has become widespread during the past few years. Deepfakes, in the form of audio, images, and videos, have become a major concern during the past few years. Complemented by artificial intelligence, deepfakes swap the face of one person with the other and generate hyper-realistic videos. Accompanying the speed of social media, deepfakes can immediately reach millions of people and can be very dangerous to make fake news, hoaxes, and fraud. Besides the well-known movie stars, politicians have been victims of deepfakes in the past, especially US presidents Barak Obama and Donald Trump, however, the public at large can be the target of deepfakes. To overcome the challenge of deepfake identification and mitigate its impact, large efforts have been carried out to devise novel methods to detect face manipulation. This study also discusses how to counter the threats from deepfake technology and alleviate its impact. The outcomes recommend that despite a serious threat to society, business, and political institutions, they can be combated through appropriate policies, regulation, individual actions, training, and education. In addition, the evolution of technology is desired for deepfake identification, content authentication, and deepfake prevention. Different studies have performed deepfake detection using machine learning and deep learning techniques such as support vector machine, random forest, multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, convolutional neural networks with and without long short-term memory, and other similar models. This study aims to highlight the recent research in deepfake images and video detection, such as deepfake creation, various detection algorithms on self-made datasets, and existing benchmark datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

Researchers aim to contribute to the digital transformation of the manufacturing ecosystem both in theory and mainly in practice by identifying the real problems that the industry faces. Researchers focus on providing practical solutions using technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Edge Computing (EC). On the other hand, universities educate young engineers and researchers by formulating a curriculum that prepares graduates for the industrial market. This research aimed to investigate and identify the industry’s current problems and needs from an educational perspective. The research methodology is based on preparing a focused questionnaire resulting from an extensive recent literature review used to interview representatives from 70 enterprises operating in 25 countries. The produced empirical data revealed (1) the kind of data and business management systems that companies have implemented to advance the digitalization of their processes, (2) the industries’ main problems and what technologies (could be) implemented to address them, and (3) what are the primary industrial needs and how they can be met to facilitate their digitization. The main conclusion is that there is a need to develop a taxonomy that shall include industrial problems and their technological solutions. Moreover, the educational needs of engineers and researchers with current knowledge and advanced skills were underlined. © 2022 by the authors.

Computer systems are capable of imitating a number of human intelligence functions, such as learning, reasoning, problem solving, speech recognition, and planning. In this regard, artificial intelligence applications have been developed to assist corporations and entrepreneurs in making business decisions. Hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the adoption of AI applications at the Vietnamese organizational level. Using the core structures of the technology–organization–environment (TOE), the theoretical model was constructed based on how technical and environmental elements influence companies’ technological innovation adoption decisions. Ten critical factors related to AI adoption are identified. To test the model, data were obtained from 193 senior managers who are directly in charge of information systems in both private and public companies in Vietnam. Subsequently, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the data. The findings indicate that technical compatibility, relative advantage, technical complexity, technical capability, managerial capability, organizational readiness, government involvement, market uncertainty, and vendor partnership are significantly related to AI application adoption. Interestingly, the study results indicated that the relationship between organization size and AI adoption was not statistically significant. Therefore, the suggested adoption of the AI application could contribute to the existing research on the adoption of AI through the TOE. Finally, the significant government law implications and future research directions are further addressed. © 2022 by the author.

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Active learning; computational notebooks; computational thinking (CT); fieldwork learning; gamification; motivation","Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Motivation; Signal encoding; Students; Teaching; Active Learning; Code; Computational notebook; Computational thinkings; Encodings; Fieldwork learning; Game; Gamification; Hybrid learning; Programming profession; Python",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131735097

New data streams (""big data"") and the exponential increase in computing power have allowed the appearance of ""new""modeling methodologies, under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI). However, many of these modeling methodologies have been around for decades. According to Gartner, technological innovation follows five distinct phases: Technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. The appearance of AI certainly elicited much hype within agriculture leading to overpromised plug-And-play solutions in a field heavily dependent on custom solutions. The threat of failure can become real when advertising a disruptive innovation as sustainable. This does not mean that we need to abandon AI models. What is most necessary is to demystify the field and place a lesser emphasis on the technology and more on business application. As AI becomes increasingly more powerful and applications start to diverge, new research fields are introduced, and opportunities arise to combine ""old""and ""new""modeling technologies into hybrids. However, sustainable application is still many years away, and companies and universities alike do well to remain at the forefront. This requires investment in hardware, software, and analytical talent. It also requires a strong connection to the outside world to test, that which does, and does not work in practice and a close view of when the field of agriculture is ready to take its next big steps. Other research fields, such as engineering and automotive, have shown that the application power of AI can be far reaching but only if a realistic view of models as whole is maintained. In this review, we share our view on the current and future limitations of modeling and potential next steps for modelers in the animal sciences. First, we discuss the inherent dependencies and limitations of modeling as a human process. Then, we highlight how models, fueled by AI, can play an enhanced sustainable role in the animal sciences ecosystem. Lastly, we provide recommendations for future animal scientists on how to support themselves, the farmers, and their field, considering the opportunities and challenges the technological innovation brings. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Do they perceive AI as a threat? The adoption of AI in the accounting field has increased significantly in the last few years. Since the techniques continue to evolve, more companies will integrate these solutions to facilitate the accounting processes. Therefore, the accountants’ skills should be adapted to efficiently use these solutions and continue to provide valuable support. This study explores the perception of accounting practitioners regarding the most important benefits and challenges of using AI-based technologies and analyses whether AI is being perceived as a threat that might impact employability. The data were collected during June–August 2021 using a questionnaire addressed to accounting practitioners from Romania. The exploratory research was conducted by statistically analysing the data collected. The results highlight that the practitioners have a clear understanding regarding the main benefits and challenges associated with the use of AI-based solutions in accounting processes, and AI is not perceived as a threat to employability; however, practitioners acknowledge that skills transformation is required and are willing to undergo the changes. By providing a glimpse of the main drivers that encourage accounting practitioners to embrace AI, employers, professional bodies and academia can address the main concerns and continue to support the practitioners in adapting their skills. © 2022 by the authors.

This is because we ought to expect vulnerability to be the norm rather than the exception. The information paradigm prevalent in EU consumer law also needs to be altered to solve the systemic vulnerability problems rife in digital markets. It should no longer be about consumers defending themselves (using rather imperfect instruments in the process), but about businesses behaving fairly and skilled enforcers ensuring obligations are fulfilled.

The use of AI, coupled with the availability of extensive amounts of ‘alternative’ data, poses several questions as to the level of protection granted to consumers in relation to the discriminatory effects that an ungoverned used of such technology can generate. The article addresses the suitability of the Proposal for a new Directive on Consumer Credit to protect consumers that enter into credit agreements where access to credit is determined by AI-based credit scoring systems. In doing so, it also takes into consideration other rules within the EU legal framework that can provide, albeit indirectly, protection to consumers, such as antidiscrimination law and Article 22 of the GDPR.

For enterprises, relying on past experiences and strategies to respond to such an unforeseen financial crisis is not appropriate or sufficient. Thus, there is an urgent requirement to reexamine and revise an enterprise’s inherent crisis management architecture so as to help it recover sooner after having encountered extremely negative economic effects. To fulfill this need, the present paper introduces a fusion architecture that integrates artificial intelligence and multiple criteria decision making to exploit essential risk factors and identify the intertwined relations between dimensions/criteria for managers to prioritize improvement plans and deploy resources to key areas without any waste. The result indicated the accurate improvement priorities, which ran in the order of financial sustainability (A), customer and stakeholders (B), enablers’ learning and growth (D), and internal business process (C) based on the measurement of the impact. The method herein will help to effectively and efficiently support crisis management for an organization confronting COVID-19.

Its philosophy is to democratize UK dermatological clinical research and to tackle important clinical questions that industry has no incentive to answer. The network also plays a key role in training and capacity development. Its membership of over 1000 individuals includes dermatology consultants, trainees, dermatology nurses, general practitioners, methodologists and patients. Its organizational structures are lean and include a co-ordinating team based at the Centre of Evidence-Based Dermatology in Nottingham, and an executive with independent members to ensure probity and business progression. A prioritization panel and steering group enable a pipeline of projects to be prioritized and refined for external funding from independent sources. The UK DCTN has supported and completed 12 national clinical trials, attracting investment of over £15 million into UK clinical dermatology research. Trials have covered a range of interventions from drugs such as doxycycline (BLISTER), silk clothing for eczema (CLOTHES) and surgical interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa (THESEUS). Trial results are published in prestigious journals and have global impact. Genuine partnership with patients and carers has been a strong feature of the network since its inception. The UK DCTN is proud of its first 20 years of collaborative work, and aims to remain at the forefront of independent dermatological health technology assessment, as well as expanding into areas including diagnostics, artificial intelligence, efficient studies and innovative designs. © 2022 The Authors.

Hence, instead of fully automated scheduling systems, steel manufacturers prefer auxiliary recommendation algorithms. Through the suggestion of suitable orders, these algorithms assist human expert planners who are tasked with the selection and scheduling of customer orders. However, it is hard to estimate, what degree of complexity these algorithms should have as steel campaign planning generally lacks precise rule-based procedures; in fact, it requires far-reaching domain knowledge as well as intuition that can only be acquired by years of business experience. Here, contrary to developing new algorithms or improving older ones, we introduce a shuffling-aided network method to assess the complexity of the selection patterns established by a human expert. This technique allows us to formalize and represent the tacit knowledge that enters the campaign planning. As a result of the network analysis, we have discovered that the choice of appropriate customer orders for immediate production is primarily determined by the orders’ carbon content (to be precise: the carbon equivalent).

Patent management, especially the search for and analysis of patents, is also being shaped by digitalization advances. Unlike prior studies – which mainly focus on the purposes and methods used for patent search and analysis –, this review focuses on the underlying digitalization trends that have become mainstream in the landscape of providers’ patent information databases and interrogation tools. By analyzing seven public and 20 commercial providers, a total of 15 different digitalization trends are outlined. Public providers specifically focus on trends for patent search, e.g. machine translation, while commercial providers rather focus on more sophisticated trends for patent analysis, e.g. predictive analytics. All of the 15 identified trends point toward four digitalization domains that were discerned by means of a hybrid coding approach, namely cloud computer technology, data management, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Conclusively, tensions that are caused by the progress of these trends are discussed, e.g. the seamless transition from search to analysis versus less explainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computer technology; Data analytics; Data management; Digitalization; Patent search and analysis",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126660774

The increasing use of cutting-edge technologies has boosted effectiveness, efficiency and productivity, as existing and new knowledge within an organization continues to improve AI abilities. Consequently, AI can identify redundancies within business processes and offer optimal resource utilization for improved performance. However, the lack of integration of existing and new knowledge makes it problematic to ascertain the required nature of knowledge needed for AI's ability to optimally improve organizational performance. Hence, organizations continue to face reoccurring challenges in their business processes, competition, technological advancement and finding new solutions in a fast-changing society. To address this knowledge gap, this study applies a fuzzy set-theoretic approach underpinned by the conceptualization of AI, knowledge sharing (KS) and organizational performance (OP). Our result suggests that the implementation of AI technologies alone is not sufficient in improving organizational performance. Rather, a complementary system that combines AI and KS provides a more sustainable organizational performance strategy for business operations in a constantly changing digitized society. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Business processes; Knowledge sharing; Organizational performance; Performance management",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126594358

Firms invest billions of dollars every year in knowledge management systems, which commonly use artificial intelligence to allow within-firm knowledge transfer to occur automatically. Despite this investment, these systems often fall short of producing expected results. Using psychology theory on goal dilution, we argue that a potential cause of the failure is that the prospect of knowledge transfer has a negative effect on knowledge creation. We further propose a mechanism to mitigate that effect. Specifically, we predict that the negative effect of knowledge transfer on knowledge creation will be mitigated when the linkages among firm- and unit-level goals are communicated. We conduct an experiment and find that while, as predicted, the prospect of knowledge transfer has a negative effect on knowledge creation when the linkages among firm- and unit-level goals are not communicated, it has the predicted positive effect when the linkages among firm- and unit-level goals are communicated due to increased goal congruence. Additional analyses provide support for our underlying theories.

There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR. Future research directions are proposed for AI-enabled resilient supply chain management.

Whereas human resources analytics has been largely discussed in literature in the last decade, a systematic identification and classification of key topics is yet to be introduced. In particular, there is room for conceptual contributions aiming to provide a comprehensive definition of concepts and investigation areas related to HR analytics. Using a systematic literature review process, we deconstruct the concept of human resources analytics as presented in a vast although fragmented literature, and we identify 106 key research topics associated to three major areas, i.e. enablers of HR analytics (technological and organizational), applications (descriptive and diagnostic/prescriptive), and value (employee value and organizational value). We also speculate on an “exponential” view of HR analytics enabled by the affirmation of artificial intelligence and cognitive technologies. The article provides a large systematization effort and a research agenda for developing further studies in the field of HR analytics. By a practitioner perspective, the study offers insights to support the design of innovative analytics projects within organizations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Digital technologies; Exponential analytics; Framework; Human capital; Human resources analytics; Research topics; Systematization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099133863

Artificial intelligence has been proved as one of the innovative tools of digitalization to change consumer's media habits. Owing to the growing trends of e-commerce, the traditional advertising model is insufficient. Therefore, advertisers are taking advantage of artificial intelligence technology to meet current requirements. Thus, a deeper understanding of product advertisement with reference to consumer sentiments and its implications need to be established. The current research depicts the contribution of artificial intelligence to analyze the consumers' attention, cognition, and emotion. The target product was Samsung Galaxy. Researcher of the current study has employed Think-aloud procedure for data analysis. Tweets dataset was divided into 2 categories. For international consumers' sentiments 30,877 tweets whereas for Pakistani consumers' sentiments tweets dataset was 26,834. For data analysis, authors used Nvivo for generating theme. The Nvivo produced word cloud. The word cloud generated with Pakistani tweets revealed that consumer attachment with Samsung product is based on emotional and attention and the preferred features of Samsung products are linked with emotional and attention. In contrary to that rest of the world tweets unfolded that emotion, attention, and cognition make consumer preferences while selecting Samsung products. This study is useful to the cellular companies for targeting across the world population. The consumer preference varies while selecting cell phones. This study will provide a better idea to cell phone companies for manufacturing consumer oriented cell phones to get better results. Moreover, future research should add more countries separate data and generate a comparative study between developed countries consumer and developing countries consumer preferences. In addition to companies with better insights of consumer can highlight the most attractive features of cell phone in their advertisements.

This scenario may impede the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8). In this context, the role of government and regulation becomes crucial in order to prevent an undesirable scenario, where technological change, namely automation and AI, comes at the cost of mass unemployment and growing inequality. This paper focuses on the role of taxation as a possible tool for sharing the gains from automation and AI. Nowadays, advances in technology may have a direct impact on tax systems, which should be re-adapted to take into account new forms of jobs and new business models. The paper discusses pros and cons of several possible solutions and then compares progresses achieved in different countries. Concerning robot tax and digital taxes there are already some concrete steps undertaken both at national and international level, while other proposals remain still nebulous. Of course, taxation per se, and any single policy in general, is not sufficient to achieve a more inclusive and equal growth. It is instead crucial to create synergies across policies and a strong link between employment creation strategies, redistributive policies, skill development and social protection systems.

A few trends are already foreseeable such as an increased number of patients, advanced technologies, different health-related business models, increased costs, revised ethics, and regulatory procedures. Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The “P4 of health”, a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem. Lastly, based on the developed framework, we aim to conduct regular surveys to capture up-to-date technological trends, sustainable health-related business models, and interdependencies. The engagement of stakeholders through awareness and participation is the key to recognizing and improving healthcare needs and services.

Viewed as black boxes, corporations can be seen as widely and frequently regulated, regarded, and active in the same ways as conscious, thinking human beings. Viewed as white boxes, corporations can be seen to incorporate structures and functions analogous to those in the human mind that give rise to awareness and cognition, and they may possess other features that contribute to the realization of cognition in ways not found in humans. While there are certainly differences between humans and corporations in the basis and expression of cognition, the study of cognition in corporations is interesting and instructive and can be pursued as a field of inquiry in its own right. The relevance of software and systems process to corporate cognition is fundamental. Put directly, cognition is a process and corporate cognition is programmable. Thus, what we know from software engineering, process programming, and software and systems process engineering should be directly applicable to the programming (broadly construed) of corporate cognitive systems. An assessment framework such as CMMI (perhaps with a grounding on key cognitive capabilities) should remain broadly applicable to corporate cognitive processes and should serve as a guide to applying best practices in an organization. The study of corporations as artificial cognitive entities should lead to results of scientific interest and practical consequence in many areas, including codification and quantification of measures of corporate cognition, better understanding of corporate cognitive mechanisms, identification of best cognitive practices for corporations, broadening of the discipline of cognitive science, and opportunities for synergism with artificial intelligence applications in corporations. The results may be broadly applicable in society in areas of regulation; investing; employment; business contracting, mergers, and acquisitions; and with respect to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) concerns. © 2022 ACM.","Artificial cognition; cognitive engineering; cognitive process programming; corporate cognition; corporate cognitive assessment","Environmental regulations; Mergers and acquisitions; Software engineering; Artificial cognition; Cognitive assessments; Cognitive engineering; Cognitive process; Cognitive process programming; Corporate cognition; Corporate cognitive assessment; Corporates; Process programming; Cognitive systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130818555

Recent works have shown great improvements in this area thanks to artificial intelligence, but even state of the art neural networks encounter difficulties to generalize to buildings that are different from the training dataset. 3D modeling applications also requires the elevation information often retrieved from a pair of High Resolution satellite images. In this article, we show that using both images of a stereo pair as inputs to a neural network trained for building semantic segmentation achieves better results than using a single view. Especially, stereo training gives a greater ability to generalize. We show that using neural networks designed for disparity estimation performs well for building semantic segmentation from a pair of satellite views in epipolar geometry. We also discuss how radiometry and disparity both affect the definition of what a building is depending on the multi-view network architecture. © 2022 M.

The research effectively uses the holistic multiple case study design to highlight the phenomenon of how AI as the holy grail of investments is proving to be a game changer for the Indian P2P markets. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a unique research design and curates six Indian licensed Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)-P2P as exemplary cases to cull out unique contextual findings on how AI has penetrated the Indian P2P market and road ahead. The research is based on a total of 18 semi-structured interviews of six NBFC-P2P founders and 12 Fintech and P2P industry experts. These interviews were used as alternate sources of evidence for data triangulation along with within case analysis, cross-case analysis to achieve well-rounded results. Findings: The findings have been propounded in the form of unique, context specific results achieved with a bouquet of six NBFC-P2P cases and supplemented through triangulation of data done through multiple industry experts. Findings indicate that AI has reached that tipping point in India. Research limitations/implications: There is a scope of further refinement of our results with a larger sample size. Therefore future researches could consider conducting a comprehensive study including all existing NBFC-P2Ps in the space. Practical implications: The research builds perspective for improving the practice in many ways. It shows the way to the other P2Ps still stuck to manual underwriting and see merit in AI-driven processes. It would guide them to embrace new technology driven business models to enhance customer experience and champion service transformation by making financial processes faster and secure. It also highlights how some of the P2Ps are scaling up and improving their visibility and outreach through strategic partnerships. Social implications: The research would assist in creating awareness about the unique P2P sector and AI solutions for individual investors, particularly the “new to credit customers” and “thin file borrowers”. AI led initiatives in the P2P space validate a certain amount of sophistication thereby giving sanctity to the sector and would therefore enforce confidence in the minds of new age investors and borrowers. Originality/value: This original research unravels avenues for novel and untraversed area in the Indian settings where paucity of extant literature and structured data highlighted a research gap and hence necessitated this study. AI as a form of disruptive innovation offering predictive intelligence to the Indian P2P space and empowering it with process efficiency, cost optimization and client engagement is definitely paving the way for an exponential growth in the Indian Fintech Industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Credit decisioning; Cross-case analysis; Disruptive innovation; Fintech; India; NBFC-P2Ps; P2P lending",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124247698

The relationship between the variables is established using the modified total interpretive structural modelling (m-TISM) methodology. The factors are identified through literature review and expert opinion. This study investigates the hierarchical relationship between these variables. Design/methodology/approach: The modified total interpretive structural modelling (m-TISM) method is used to develop a hierarchical interrelationship among variables that display direct and indirect impact. The competitiveness of a tourism firm is measured by investigating the effect of variables on the firm's financial performance. Findings: The study identifies ten key factors essential for analysing the impact of AI on a firm's competitiveness. The m-TISM methodology gave us the hierarchical relationship between the factors and their interpretation. A theoretical TISM model has been constructed based on the hierarchy and relationship of the elements. The elements that fall in Level V are “AI Skilled Workforce”, “Infrastructure” and “Policies and Regulations”. Level IV includes the elements “AI Readiness”, “AI-Enabled Technologies” and “Digital Platforms”. Elements that fall under Level III are “Productivity” and “AI Innovation”. Level II and Level I comprise “Tourist Satisfaction” and “Financial Performance”, respectively. The levels indicate the elements' hierarchical level, with Level I the highest and Level V the lowest. Research limitations/implications: Tourism and AI scholars can analyse the given variables by including the transitive links and incorporate new variables depending upon future research. The m-TISM model constructed from literature review and expert opinion can act as a theoretical base for future studies to be conducted by researchers. Practical implications: Management/Practitioners can focus on the available characteristics and capitalise on them while working on the factors lacking in their organisation to enhance their competitiveness. Entrepreneurs starting their own business can utilise the elements in understanding the ecosystem of strengthening a firm's competitiveness. They can work to improve on the aspects which are crucial and trigger the impact on competitiveness. The government and management can devise policies and strategies that encompass the essential factors that positively impact the competitiveness of the firms. The approach can then be looked at with a holistic approach to cater to the other related components of the tourism industry.

Recently, data-driven predictions have attracted interest in high-stakes decision-making. Despite this, advanced AI methods are less often used for such tasks. This is because AI technology is a black box for the social systems it is meant to support; trustworthiness and fairness have not yet been established. Meanwhile in the field of marketing, strategic decision-making is a high-stakes problem that has a significant impact on business trends. For global marketing, with its diverse cultures and market environments, future decision-making is likely to focus on building consensus on the formulation of the problem itself rather than on solutions for achieving the goal. There are two important and conflicting facts: the fact that the core of domestic strategic decision-making comes down to the formulation of the problem itself, and the fact that it is difficult to realize AI technology that can achieve problem formulation. How can we resolve this difficulty with current technology? This is the main challenge for the realization of high-level human-AI systems in the marketing field. Thus, we propose customer journey mapping (CJM) automation through model-level data fusion, a process for the practical problem formulation known as explainable alignment. Using domain-specific requirements and observations as inputs, the system automatically outputs a CJM. Explainable alignment corresponds with both human and AI perspectives and in formulating the problem, thereby improving strategic decision-making in marketing. Following preprocessing to make latent variables and their dynamics transparent with latent Dirichlet allocation and a variational autoencoder, a post-hoc explanation is implemented in which a hidden Markov model and learning from an interpretation transition are combined with a long short-term memory architecture that learns sequential data between touchpoints for extracting attitude rules for CJM. Finally, we realize the application of human-AI systems to strategic decision-making in marketing with actual logs in over-the-top media services, in which the dynamic behavior of customers for CJM can be automatically extracted.

Issues related to protecting trade secrets, confidential information, company information and customer data continue to be problematic, especially as hackers learn new ways to defeat security measures. In addition to utilizing enhances security techniques, such as two-factor authentication (2FA). Artificial Intelligence recognizes a user's keystrokes and habits to provide additional security. Currently a big debate raging about whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a good or bad thing in terms of its impact on human life, with more and more enterprises using AI for their needs. Biometric logins are increasingly being used to create secure logins by either scanning fingerprints, retina or palm prints. This can be used alone or in conjunction with a password and is already being used in most new smart phones. Biometrics is a method of providing authentication through measurable physical characteristics. It uses characteristics of the body as a method to code or scramble/descramble data. Physical characteristics such as fingerprints, retinas and irises, palm prints, handwritten signature, wrist veins, facial structure, and voice recognition are just some of the many methods of biometric encryption in use today. Since these characteristics are unique to each individual, biometrics are seen as the answer to combat theft and fraud, particularly when dealing with commerce over the Internet. The reason that this new technology is believed to be superior to the use of passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs) is that a biometric trait cannot be lost, stolen, or recreated, at least not easily. It is based on the concept that 'you are your own password'. Soon, this kind of request may become a daily reality. Today, so many transactions and exchanges happen electronically, it is necessary to prove to a machine that you are who you claim to be. The current options are not the best way to protect private information. People loose cards, forget passwords, or write PIN numbers on a piece of paper for everyone to see. The way to keep information secure is to offer up a piece of yourself-a biometric identifier-to be recorded and used to verify your identity. © 2022 Author(s).","AI; Biometric; Business; Commerce; Hackers; Pin; Security",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130295751

Design/methodology/approach: The data in this study was collected through a structured questionnaire survey conducted in three big cities in the North of Vietnam (Hanoi, Hai Phong and Ha Long). The data set consists of 625 valid responses by Vietnamese tourists. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the causal relationships among time perspective, city image, travel motivations and tourist intention. Confirmatory factor analysis is conducted to verify the reliability and validity of each latent construct and to evaluate the discriminant validity, convergent validity, composition reliability and average variance extracted for the latent constructs. Findings: This study finds that tourists’ travel motivations, time perspective and city image are significantly and positively associated with their intention to visit city tourism. This study also reports that tourists’ time perspective and city image are significantly and positively related to their travel motivation which is in turn significantly and positively correlated to their intention to engage in city tourism. Practical implications: City tourism providers need to seek for understanding travel motivations of potential customers. City tourism products should be promoted to people who want to travel for knowledge enhancement, seeking, self-fulfillment, socializing and escape. Tourism businesses and marketers focus more on developing the overall image of city. They should have city slogan and have strategy to establish the city branding to evoke or remind the customers to come in. Since the Corona (COVID-19) pandemic impact on every nation around the world, the artificial intelligence has to be taken on city tourism to minimize the negative influence of this pandemic. Originality/value: This study reveals three key determinants of tourists’ intention including travel motivations, city image and time perspective, which have unclear study in the city tourism literature. This study also explains the role of travel motivations in mediating the impacts of their time perspective and city image on their intention to visit city tourism. Improving the city image is important to attract tourists who want to engage in city tourism for knowledge enhancement, seeking, self-fulfillment, socializing or escape. Tourism providers need to have a strategy for establishing the city branding to evoke or remind the customers to come in. The time perspective should be paid more attention to tourists who want to travel to city tourism for knowledge enhancement, seeking, self-fulfillment, socializing or escape. © 2021, International Tourism Studies Association.","City image; City tourism; Time perspective; Tourist intention; Travel motivations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116857235

This is linked with changes in working conditions that may be substantial and entail serious health risks for employees. With our paper we are the first to conduct an empirical analysis of employers' increasing flexibility requirements in the course of advancing digitalization, based on a representative business survey, the IAB Job Vacancy Survey. We combine establishment-level data from the survey and occupation-specific characteristics from other sources and apply non-linear random effects estimations. According to employers' assessments, office and secretarial occupations are undergoing the largest changes in terms of flexibility requirements, followed by other occupations that are highly relevant in the context of AI: occupations in company organization and strategy, vehicle/aerospace/shipbuilding technicians and occupations in insurance and financial services. The increasing requirements we observe most frequently are those concerning demands on employees' self-organization, although short-term working-time flexibility and workplace flexibility also play an important role. The estimation results show that the occupational characteristics, independently of the individual employer, play a major role for increasing flexibility requirements. For example, occupations with a larger share of routine cognitive activities (which in the literature are usually more closely associated with artificial intelligence than others) reveal a significantly higher probability of increasing flexibility demands, specifically with regard to the employees' self-organization. This supports the argument that AI changes above all work content and work processes. For the average age of the workforce and the unemployment rate in an occupation we find significantly negative effects. At the establishment level the share of female employees plays a significant negative role. Our findings provide clear indications for targeted action in labor market and education policy in order to minimize the risks and to strengthen the chances of an increasing application of AI technologies.

A decision-support system (DSS) is required for AMS that can integrate key mechanics of dynamic biological processes with farm economics. Here we developed and evaluated a web-based DSS named the Integrated Management Model (IMM) designed for assisting AMS farmers and their advisors to evaluate and improve the physical and economic performance of their businesses (https://bit.ly/MilkingEdgeAMSTool). The IMM comprises a series of empirically determined predictive equations derived from the main drivers of productivity and profitability in AMS, together with stochastic simulation and optimisation modelling. The equations and models in the IMM were developed using two data sources available through the Milking Edge project: (a) an annual physical and economic dataset collected from 14 AMS farms across Australia (from years 2015 to 2018), and (b) a monthly physical dataset from 23 AMS farms located across Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and Chile (years 2015 to 2019). Model predictions were evaluated using two similar datasets: (a) an annual physical and economic dataset from 11 Australian AMS farms (2018 to 2020) and a monthly physical dataset from 20 AMS from Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Argentina (2019 to 2020). The DSS was tested by 11 AMS farmers that provided feedback using the technology acceptance model framework. Results from the model evaluation showed the accuracy of the equations and simulations to predict physical variables such as milk harvested (kg milk/robot.d) or milking frequency (milkings/cow.d) was reasonably good (2–14% differences between observed and predicted values). The economic equations, which predicted operating profit margin (OP) (%) and return on total assets (ROTA) (%), could determine the relative changes and direction of profitability when physical variables change. However, the accuracy of these equations to estimate absolute values was low (ROTA: R2 0.26 and MAE 2.0%; OP: R2 0.36 and MAE 13.5%), probably due to the empirical nature of the equations and the relatively small number of farms involved in their development. Overall, farmers agreed that the IMM was a useful and easy-to-use DSS that can be used confidently to simulate physical scenarios and optimise the system performance. Whilst this DSS was designed for AMS farmers and farmers considering investing in AMS, future applications could include research, training, extension, teaching, consultancy or even innovation and development of new technology. © 2022","Dairy; Decision-making; Pasture-based; Precision livestock farming; Robotic milking","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Forecasting; HTTP; Productivity; Profitability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Australia; Automatic milking; Decisions makings; Integrated management; Ireland; Management Model; Milking systems; Pasture-based; Precision livestock farming; Robotic milking; Decision making; biological processes; Argentina; Australia; Chile; Ireland; New Zealand; Sjaelland",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134621227

Second, we propose an AI governance framework that aims to better assess AI challenges as well as how different governance modalities (architecture, laws, norms, and market) can support AI. At the heart of our framework lies the governance forces that apply to institutions, organizations, and individuals, who ultimately provide, regulate, and use AI decision-making. We discuss how businesses may harness AI’s economic power through governance solutions without creating or amplifying societal biases and inequalities. Third, as part of our section on future research, we identify a set of governance trade-offs in AI adoption, suggest future research avenues to conceptually strengthen research on the governance of AI, and lay out key policy recommendations. © The Author(s) 2022.","artificial intelligence; big data; governance; institutions; machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131858357

Many companies are propelling company-wide digital transformation strategies based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology for the digital innovation of organizations and businesses. This study aims to define the factors affecting digital transformation strategies and present a decision-making model required for digital transformation strategies based on the definition. It also reviews previous AI technology and digital transformation strategies and draws influence factors. The research model drew four evaluation areas, such as subject, environment, resource, and mechanism, and 16 evaluation factors through the SERM model. After the factors were reviewed through the Delphi methods, a questionnaire survey was conducted targeting experts with over 10 years of work experience in the digital strategy field. The study results were produced by comparing the data’s importance using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) on each group. According to the analysis, the subject was the most critical factor, and the CEO (top management) was more vital than the core talent or technical development organization. The importance was shown in the order of resource, mechanism and environment, following subject. It was ascertained that there were differences of importance in industrial competition and market digitalization in the demander and provider groups. © 2022 by the authors.

With the theme “Building on Its Past,” the nine articles address a host of contemporary issues, including climate change, wicked problems, business and human rights, human health, certifications standards, the governance of artificial intelligence, stakeholder engagement, stakeholder theory, and corporate political activity. Together, these reviews offer a wealth of suggested themes, theories and approaches that can drive our research forward for the next decades in business and society research and practice. Using the lens of a miner-prospector continuum to categorize the diversity of articles within this special issue, a common theme emerges across the portfolio of reviews: they all call for a more systemic and integrative perspective toward studying the complex interactions that link business and society actors and issues. Building on these findings, we encourage future scholars to fill long-standing researched gaps through a more open systems approach, which supports both contextually sensitive and multi-level and multi-disciplinary approaches to address grand societal challenges. We conclude with specific suggestions as to how business and society scholars might use an open systems approach, including embracing methodologies to address complex causal pathways, theorizing with a view towards spanning external and internal elements of an organization, and reflecting on the temporal and spatial dynamics of complex systems. © The Author(s) 2022.","Literature Reviews; Open Systems; Social Issues; Stakeholders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130553468

However, this article analyzes the potential for altering the traditional terms of the contradictory capital-labor relationship. Through an extensive literature review, industry 4.0 is described in its historical-economic context, highlighting the trends it drives. While most authors emphasize connectivity and technical interaction, this text emphasizes the distinctive economic aspect of this revolution. It highlights how the involvement of disruptive technologies to achieve high automation represents a clear trend towards the disappearance of salaried employment, with the exception of the minimal occupation of skilled labor and services. The union of this type of technologies represents a qualitative leap due to the elimination of downtime between individual companies and along all production chains.

In this paper, findings from neuroscience studies concerned with adaptive behavior for ecological fitness are applied to explore industrial adaptive behavior. This is important because many companies are not able to manage dynamics between adaptability and stability. The reported analysis relates business-to-business signaling in competitive environments to three levels of inference. In accordance with neuroscience studies concerned with adaptive behavior, trade-offs between complexity and accuracy in business-to-business signaling and inference are explained. In addition, signaling and inference are related to risks and ambiguities in competitive industrial markets. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of industrial adaptive behavior in terms of relevant neuroscience constructs. In doing so, the paper makes a contribution to the field of organizational neuroscience, and to research concerned with industrial adaptive behavior.

Relevant data acquisition, analysis, harnessing, and mining are now fully considered vital drivers for business growth in these industries. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), can assist, particularly in learning patterns in big data chunks, intelligent extrapolative extraction of data and automatic decision-making in predictive learning. Firstly, in this paper, a detailed performance benchmarking of adaptive learning capacities of different key machine-learning-based regression models is provided for extrapolative analysis of throughput data acquired at the different user communication distances to the gNodeB transmitter in 5G new radio networks. Secondly, a random forest (RF)-based machine learning model combined with a least-squares boosting algorithm and Bayesian hyperparameter tuning method for further extrapolative analysis of the acquired throughput data is proposed. The proposed model is herein referred to as the RF-LS-BPT method. While the least-squares boosting algorithm is engaged to turn the possible RF weak learners to form stronger ones, resulting in a single strong prediction model, the Bayesian hyperparameter tuning automatically determines the best RF hyperparameter values, thereby enabling the proposed RF-LS-BPT model to obtain desired optimal prediction performance. The application of the proposed RF-LS-BPT method showed superior prediction accuracy over the ordinary random forest model and six other machine-learning-based regression models on the acquired throughput data. The coefficient of determination (Rsq) and mean absolute error (MAE) values obtained for the throughput prediction at different user locations using the proposed RF-LS-BPT method range from 0.9800 to 0.9999 and 0.42 to 4.24, respectively. The standard RF models attained 0.9644 to 0.9944 Rsq and 5.47 to 12.56 MAE values. The improved throughput prediction accuracy of the proposed RF-LS-BPT method demonstrates the significance of hyperparameter tuning/optimization in developing precise and reliable machine-learning-based regression models. The projected model would find valuable applications in throughput estimation and modeling in 5G and beyond 5G wireless communication systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not all types of AI are human-like–in fact, many of the most powerful systems are very different from humans–and an excessive focus on developing and deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers. © 2022 by Erik Brynjolfsson Published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.",,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129161325

The emerging Industry 4.0 has introduced promising potential technologies that have expedited the transition of Internet of Things (IoT) into the Internet of Everything (IoE), utilizing the advances in artificial intelligence. Such a transition implies that sensitive data can be effortlessly accessed via the open network used by various domains such as military, business, transportation, medical, and education, leading to potential security concerns.

In view of the fact that the previous control approaches were usually overly dependent on the model parameters of system, and most existing RL methods are based on state feedback, their application in actual industrial production is limited. Additionally, developing accurate process system models and ensuring the closed-loop system's control performance is more challenging, as modern businesses place a premium on product quality and economic efficiency. As a result, this work introduces a novel data-driven two-dimensional (2D) off-policy Q-learning method based on output feedback is used to achieve optimal tracking control for batch process. First, the error between the actual output and the given set-point is extended to the system to ensure the good tracking performance. Second, by analyzing the relationship between the value function and the Q-function obtained from the 2D system's performance index, the 2D Bellman equation is obtained in terms of output feedback that is independent of the model parameters. The optimal control problem can be effectively solved by the proposed method in this paper when the policy iteration is executed using only the measurement data of system along the batch and time directions. Following that, the proposed approach's unbiasedness and convergence are strictly confirmed.

New technologies have made considerable improvements in the whole process of inventory management; Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the best options for the industry and their search for more intelligent and robust logistics solutions. Based on a real-world scenario, we approach the challenge of defining delivery routes within a city such that the time they require to be traveled is approximately the same. Moreover, while the routes must ensure that drivers’ workload is time balanced and contract regulations can be met, they also must correspond to a customers’ partition (sectorization) according to well-defined, non-overlapping delivery areas. We introduce an approach to solve the problem through the algorithm HSAC (Hierarchical Simulated Annealing Clustering). The proposed algorithm first applies a divisive approach to the data, using simulated annealing at each step to create time-balanced partitions, and then solves the TSP problem to create optimal routes within the defined groups. Based on real data concerning two Mexican cities, our experimental results show that HSAC can solve the sectorization problem efficiently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Balanced clustering; Biobjective optimization; Simulated annealing","Clustering algorithms; Inventory control; Supply chains; Balanced clustering; Bi-objective optimization; Chain organizations; Clusterings; Delivery-logistics problems; Distribution business; Manufacturing business; Retail business; Sectorization; Wholesale business; Simulated annealing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126578612

It needs proper coordination from various teams in planning, execution, and testing. Many software products have high numbers of defects revealed in a production environment. Software failures are costly regarding money, time, and reputation for a business and even life-threatening if utilized in critical applications. Identifying and fixing software defects in the production system is costly, which could be a trivial task if detected before shipping the product. Binary classification is commonly used in existing software defect prediction studies. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence techniques, there is a great potential to provide meaningful information to software development teams for producing quality software products. An extensive survey for Software Defect Prediction is necessary for exploring datasets, data validation methods, defect detection, and prediction approaches and tools. The survey infers standard datasets utilized in early studies lack adequate features and data validation techniques. According to the finding of the literature survey, the standard datasets has few labels, resulting in insufficient details regarding defects. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) on Software Defect Prediction are limited. Hence this SLR presents a comprehensive analysis of defect datasets, dataset validation, detection, prediction approaches, and tools for Software Defect Prediction.

Utilities around the world incur huge costs due to NTLs estimated at billions of dollars. Therefore, reducing NTLs has become pertinent for utilities to improve revenue generation, profitability on investment, and grid reliability. In the last decade, artificial intelligence and machine learning have been the predominant trend to detect NTL in the industry and academia to elicit scrutiny of suspicious customers. While these methods have succeeded in identifying and detecting NTLs, it continues to thrive, particularly in developing economies. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the issues hindering customers from paying for electricity consumed and the quantum effect on the utilities. Bayesian Network, a machine learning approach that has proven to help depict causes and effects, has been explored to provide valuable insights into the impact of some of the significant causes of NTLs. We evaluated the resultant Bayesian model with five other Machine Learning models. Causes of NTLs like unpaid bills and electricity theft have been a severe challenge to utilities from inception. Thus, utilities are facing enormous business challenges and are seeking some form of transformation to ensure sustainability. The study shows that revenue collection through customers paying bills is fundamental to this strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","Bayesian network; Power utilities; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125035820

The most readily available source of energy is solar energy but solar energy has nonlinear nature due to the random nature of climate conditions. So, one way to solve is solar radiation prediction and solar energy prediction using more accurate techniques. Also, energy business and power system control units require more accuracy along with very short to large duration prediction in advance. So, to complete the requirement many prediction techniques are used and among them, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Fuzzy are more accurate and reliable techniques. In this paper basically, a literature study for solar radiation and energy prediction using ANN and Fuzzy logic techniques has been carried out. Many studies are reviewed and then selected some most accurate, reliable, and relevant studies for further study. ANN models with different algorithms such as feed-forward back-propagation-based ANN, Multi-layer feed-forward-based ANN model, Linear regression with ANN model, GNN-based model are reviewed in the study. ANN models with different input parameters combinations and the different number of neurons were also reviewed. Fuzzy logic-based and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy interface (ANFIS)-based different models have been reviewed and observed that the ANFIS technique performs better. From the study, it has been noted that ANN and Fuzzy logic employed models are most effective for estimation than any other empirical models. It is found that solar radiation and energy prediction models are dependent on input parameters more. At last, highlighted some possible research opportunities and areas for better efficiency of the results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial Intelligence; Solar Energy Estimation; Solar Radiation","alternative energy; artificial intelligence; climate conditions; empirical analysis; regression analysis; solar radiation; algorithm; fuzzy logic; solar energy; statistical model; Algorithms; Fuzzy Logic; Linear Models; Neural Networks, Computer; Solar Energy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124739963

The comparison is made along two sets of criterias capturing: the ability to pass compliance tests used by the regulators during on-site missions of model validation (i), and the induced changes in capital requirement (ii). The different models show noticeable differences in their ability to pass the regulatory tests and to lead to a reduction in capital requirement. While displaying a similar ability than the traditional model to pass compliance tests, neural networks provide the strongest incentive for banks to apply AI models for their internal model of credit risk of corporate businesses as they lead in some cases to sizeable reduction in capital requirement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Credit risk; Regulatory requirement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123614970

Unfortunately, many schools lack a sense of social responsibility when applying digital education. Students are online more than ever before. There are the potential for increased exposure to risks such as exposure to harmful content, cyberbullying, age-inappropriate advertising and data misuse, which affect students’ well-being and undermine their right to privacy. Schools should bear the overall social moral level of social responsibility. This paper focuses on the social responsibility of schools under the new crown epidemic and holds that implanting social responsibility into the value system of the current digital education reform, which can promote the sustainable development of education. This is also a relatively neglected problem in the practice of educational reform. European standard: ISO26000 is adopted as a CEN-standard. 21 October 2020 the stakeholder consultation process in the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) decided that ISO 26000 is approved as a CEN-standard. For businesses and organizations committed to operating in a socially responsible way, there's ISO 26000. It provides guidance to those who recognize that respect for society and environment is a critical success factor.

This article describes advancements made within the pharmaceutical industry from theoretical concepts to utilization of structured content and data in CMC submissions. The term Structured Content and Data Management (SCDM) outlines the end-to-end scientific data lifecycle from capture in source systems, aggregation into a consolidated repository, and transformation into semantically structured blocks with metadata defining relationships between scientific data and business contexts. Automation of regulatory authoring (termed Structured Content Authoring) is feasible because SCDM makes data both human and machine readable. It will offer health authorities access to the digital data beyond the current standard of PDF documents and, for a review process, SCDM would “enrich the effectiveness, efficiency, and consistency of regulatory quality oversight” (Yu et al., 2019).

Conventional methods of scoring and subjective evaluation are at odds with the requirements of timeliness, objectivity, intelligence and authority of green certification risk assessment in the era of “big data.” In this study, an improved prototype decision structure was developed based on published literature. Then the Delphi method was used to reach consensus among experts, identify the key risk points of green building materials certification (GBMC), and build a formal decision structure consisting of three aspects and 11 risk points. A conventional back-propagation (BP) neural network model and a Levenberg–Marquardt (L–M) improved BP model, were used to assess the risk of GBMC. The applicability and characteristics of the two models were compared using empirical data. Both models accurately described the risk of GBMC, but the improved LMBP model performed better. The results showed that the new LMBP model performs better than the conventional BP model in terms of mean square error, gradient to a solution, and training efficiency. The enhancement effects were improved by 99.1%, 91.9%, and 33.3%, respectively. This paper believes that when assessing the risk of GBMC, considerations should include not only the risk in the certification process, but also the internal risk of certification agencies and certification businesses. Furthermore, the proposed LMBP model is suitable for use in assessing the risk assessment of GBMC, especially in the environment of “big data”. In order to effectively control the risk of GBMC, the risk of certification institutions, including historical risk, experience risk and ability risk, as well as the risk related to the application enterprise, including its credit risk, satisfaction risk and green index risk, should be taken into account seriously. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","BP neural network; Delphi method; Green building materials certification; L–M algorithm; Risk assessment","artificial neural network; certification; construction material; Delphi analysis; risk assessment; training",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112153266

However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1) divergent perspectives on fairness, 2) the accuracy of AI, 3) the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4) the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5) the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace. © 2022 ACM.","Algorithmic management; Artificial intelligence (AI); Explainable AI (XAI); Fair and responsible AI; Future of work; Human Intervention; Human resource management; Interpretability; Stakeholder-centered design; Transparency","Economic and social effects; Human resource management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Algorithmic management; Algorithmics; Artificial intelligence; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Fair and responsible artificial intelligence; Future of works; Human intervention; Human resources management; Interpretability; Stakeholder-centered design; Transparency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130584897

However, the existing studies have explored the mechanism of the role of RQ in a limited way. In order to respond to this critical issue, this study constructs a theoretical model based on attachment theory and combined with self-determination theory, with autonomy needs (AN), competence needs (CN), and relationship needs (RN) as influencing factors, emotional attachment (EA) as mediating variables and relationship quality as outcome variables, and the moderating role of attachment anxiety (AA) in which this study also analyzes the mechanism of short video applications users’ psychological needs on relationship quality by combining the moderating role of AA. In this study, a sample of 512 university students using short video applications was used. The results of the data analysis indicated that EA was significantly influenced by psychological needs that played a positive role in relationship quality and mediated the relationship between psychological needs and relationship quality. The results of further analysis also revealed that attachment anxiety plays a moderating role in the relationship between emotional attachment and relationship quality. This study examines the intrinsic mechanism by which psychological needs affect relationship quality through emotional attachment, reveals the practical effects of short video applications users’ sustained use behavior, and provides a reference for innovative management and business practices of short video applications.

Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in achieving DT. As DT is touching each sphere of humanity, AI led DT is raising many fundamental questions. These questions raise concerns for the systems deployed, how they should behave, what risks they carry, the monitoring and evaluation control we have in hand, etc. These issues call for the need to integrate ethics in AI led DT. The purpose of this study is to develop an “AI led ethical digital transformation framework”. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature survey, various existing business ethics decision-making models were synthesised. The authors mapped essential characteristics such as intensity and the individual, organisational and opportunity factors of ethics models with the proposed AI led ethical DT. The DT framework is evaluated using a thematic analysis of 23 expert interviews with relevant AI ethics personas from industry and society. The qualitative data of the interviews and opinion data has been analysed using MAXQDA software. Findings: The authors have explored how AI can drive the ethical DT framework and have identified the core constituents of developing an AI led ethical DT framework. Backed by established ethical theories, the paper presents how DT pillars are related and sequenced to ethical factors. This research provides the potential to examine theoretically sequenced ethical factors with practical DT pillars. Originality/value: The study establishes deduced and induced ethical value codes based on thematic analysis to develop guidelines for the pursuit of ethical DT. The authors identify four unique induced themes, namely, corporate social responsibility, perceived value, standard benchmarking and learning willingness. The comprehensive findings of this research, supported by a robust theoretical background, have substantial implications for academic research and corporate applicability. The proposed AI led ethical DT framework is unique and can be used for integrated social, technological and economic ethical research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AI ethics; Artificial intelligence (AI); Business ethics; Digital transformation; Ethical decision-making models; MAXQDA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120477032

Determining how to profit from data deluge can give companies an edge in the market because data have the potential to add tremendous value to many aspects of a business. The market has already seen a level of monetization across vertical domains in the form of layering connected devices with a variety of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) choices, such as subscription plans or smart device insights. Out of this arena is evolving a 'machine economy' in which the ability to correctly monetize data rather than simply hoard it, will provide a significant advantage in a competitive digital environment. The recent advent of the technological advances in the fields of big data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues of competition, where data are utilized strategically and treated as a continuously changing asset able to unleash new revenue opportunities for monetization. Such growth has made room for an onslaught of new tools, architectures, business models, platforms, and marketplaces that enable organizations to successfully monetize data. In fact, emerging business models are striving to alter the power balance between users and companies that harvest information. Start-ups and organizations are offering to sell user data to data analytics companies and other businesses. Monetizing data goes beyond just selling data. It is also possible to include steps that add value to data. Generally, organizations can monetize data by: 1) utilizing it to make better business decisions or improve processes; 2) surrounding flagship services or products with data; or 3) selling information to current or new markets. This article will address all important aspects of IoT data monetization with more focus on the healthcare industry and discuss the corresponding challenges, such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, security, and privacy. In addition, it presents a holistic reference architecture for the healthcare data economy with an in-depth case study on the detection and prediction of cardiac anomalies using multiparty computation (MPC) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); big data; blockchain; eHealth; healthcare; Internet of Things (IoT)","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Blockchain; Commerce; eHealth; Information management; Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sales; Software as a service (SaaS); Artificial intelligence; Block-chain; Business models; Digital environment; Ehealth; Internet of thing; Modeling platforms; Power balance; Smart devices; Technological advances; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128491511

The opportunities are significantly greater when data can be shared using a marketplace concept. This provides a framework where many suppliers of data can interact with consumers of data, such as artificial intelligence (AI) developers and IoT service providers. Their marketplace interactions provide a means to identify the demand for specific types of data and to incentivize suppliers to offer high quality and dependable data. Standardization is a prerequisite for an effective marketplace in terms of setting the rules for interactions and in establishing a technical baseline for data supply and consumption. This article introduces an IoT data marketplace framework and illustrates its application through a set of smart city and intelligent transport system deployments. It highlights the use of oneM2M, which is an open standard for the middleware layer in the IoT technology stack. oneM2M's middleware capabilities reside between IoT devices and communication networks, and the AI/ML and IoT applications that consume IoT data. The proposed IoT data marketplace also includes licensing, usage tracking, and secured data sharing features. These provide marketplace users with the tools to control data sharing and monetization.

However, there are still some deficiencies in the BSGs, such as limited guidance, low uncertainty and limited simulation environment, which make it impossible to exert the maximum effect. Artificial intelligence (AI) can solve the above shortcomings. The combination of AI and BSGs is the possible development direction of BSGs. But how to effectively combine BSGs with AI is still an open question. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze how participants’ entrepreneurial attitude changes in BSGs. The results show that BSGs can effectively improve entrepreneurial attitude, and there are four types of promotion configurations. These four configurations consist of five antecedent conditions. According to the above conclusions, AI can improve entrepreneurial attitude in BSGs in various ways, such as simulating competitors, providing targeted feedback for failures, and improving game experience. The contribution of this paper is to highlight the possibility of combining AI with BSGs, and to provide suggestions on how AI can intervene in BSGs.

It is the disorder in which the cyst is formed in the ovary. The oocyte does not get mature at its natural which and form a fluid-filled sacs known as cyst. When there are many cysts in the ovary, it is then known as polycystic ovary. It may affect both the ovaries. It causes absent menstrual cycles, weight gain, hirsutism, pigmentation, and decrease in hair volume. There are some studies which say that this is a lifestyle disorder, but the main reason is not known yet. PCOS leads to an obstacle in conceiving. It can be suppressed by some changes in lifestyle patterns such as daily exercise and food patterns. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a science and engineering subject that deals with intelligent behavior. It is a subfield of computer science that has improved human existence in a variety of ways. AI is a combination of reasoning, learning, problem-solving perception, and language understanding. A general introduction to the subject of AI creates a new revolution in the world and creates a great scope in future to describe machines that mimic human nature in association with 'cognitive' functions of human mind, such as 'learning' and 'problem-solving.'AI is the technique in which the human work is totally handled by machines. In various domains, AI has recently outperformed humans, and there is enormous potential in healthcare. The health-care system deals with a massive volume of data that is difficult to examine using standard approaches. AI's success in health-care offers improved illness prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment. There are many inventions in machines which can take over the manual work. The AI can reduce the percentage of human error and provides the best and fast result. Together, human people and innovation may pave the road for better health-care services. The ability for a system to automatically learn and improve is provided by machine learning, a branch of AI logically planned. Its main objective is to create new machine learning algorithms that allow users to access specific datasets and use the information for analysis and research the unstructured. Applications of machine learning support significant change, particularly in businesses such as health care that deal with data identification, image recognition, prediction, and identification. Much critical attention has been paid to PCOS screening. In order to address this problem, the current study was created to investigate a noninvasive way to aid in PCOS screening. Our research demonstrates that the suggested algorithm successfully detects PCOS (mean area under the curve of 0.978), suggesting that deep learning may be a potent technique for PCOS identification. In addition, research findings may suggest the exceptional potential of using scleral pictures to diagnose diseases. A fruitful study area may emerge from the integration of AI and characteristics taken from scleral pictures. This article mainly is about PCOS and the role of AI for its diagnosis and better results. The transvaginal ultrasound machine is a noninvasive means of examining the human ovary to show important aspects for PCOS diagnosis. The key characteristics that distinguish ovarian pictures are the number of follicles and their diameters. As a result, PCOS is diagnosed by manually counting follicles and measuring their diameters. This procedure is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. So to make this process easy and error free the introduction of AI is needed. © 2022 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Follicle; hirsutism; polycystic ovary syndrome; transvaginal ultrasound machines",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140212468

Considering the problems of non-cellular and cellular wireless access technology, the advantages of cooperatively using heterogeneous wireless resources around rail transit for network convergence and cooperative communications were expounded. The convergence schemes of heterogeneous smart cooperative vehicular networks were discussed from the aspects of the network model and network architecture. In view of the business requirements of intelligent rail transit, the existing research on heterogeneous smart cooperative vehicular networks was systematically classified from the perspectives of reliability and resource utilization. The future development trends of heterogeneous smart cooperative vehicular networks were proposed regarding artificial intelligence, security, and cloud-edge combination. Research results show that the reliability of heterogeneous smart cooperative vehicular networks is comprised of network architecture reliability and data transmission reliability. The former mainly proposes improving reliability in the ways of redundant network architecture, vehicle-to-cloud transmission architecture, software-defined network architecture, and smart and cooperative network architecture. The latter focuses on reducing the packet loss rate in the process of transmission through three ways, i.e., multi-path transmission, network coding, and handoff algorithms. The resource utilization of heterogeneous smart cooperative vehicular networks can be divided into wireless access resource utilization and link scheduling resource utilization. The former improves the throughput and resource utilization by three methods, i.e., channel state prediction, spectrum division, and frequency shift compensation. The latter reduces the influence of heterogeneous links on data transmission and the times of data retransmission and raises the utilization of network resources mainly by scheduling algorithm, receiving and buffer algorithm, and congestion control algorithm. © 2022, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

One problem that urgently needs to be solved in the industry involves how to perform feature extractions, transformations, and operations in graph-structured data to solve downstream tasks, such as node classifications and graph classifications in actual business scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a gated recursion-based graph neural network (GR-GNN) algorithm to solve tasks such as node depth-dependent feature extractions and node classifications for graph-structured data. The GRU neural network unit was used to complete the node classification task and, thereby, construct the GR-GNN model. In order to verify the accuracy, effectiveness, and superiority of the algorithm on the open datasets Cora, CiteseerX, and PubMed, the algorithm was used to compare the operation results with the classical graph neural network baseline algorithms GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, respectively. The experimental results show that, on the validation set, the accuracy and target loss of the GR-GNN algorithm are better than or equal to other baseline algorithms; in terms of algorithm convergence speed, the performance of the GR-GNN algorithm is comparable to that of the GCN algorithm, which is higher than other algorithms. The research results show that the GR-GNN algorithm proposed in this paper has high accuracy and computational efficiency, and very wide application significance. © 2022 by the authors.

Blockchains have demonstrated impressive and effective applications throughout many aspects of the business. Blockchain technology can lead to the advent of the construction of Digital Twins (DTs). DTs involve the real representation of physical devices digitally as a virtual representation of both elements and dynamics prior to the building and deployment of actual devices. DT products can be built using blockchain-based technology in order to achieve sustainability. The technology of DT is one of the emerging novel technologies of Industry 4.0, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, the present study adopts intelligent decision-making techniques to con-duct a biased analysis of the drivers, barriers, and risks involved in applying blockchain technologies to the sustainable production of DTs. The proposed model illustrates the use of neutrosophic theory to handle the uncertain conditions of real-life situations and the indeterminate cases evolved in decision-makers’ judgments and perspectives. In addition, the model applies the analysis of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods through the use of ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and the Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to achieve optimal rankings for DT production providers based on consistent weighted decision-maker’s judgments in order to maintain and to assure sustainability. An empirical study is applied to the uncertain environment to aid decision-makers in achieving ideal decisions for DT providers with respect to various DT challenges, promoting sustainability and determining the best service providers. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to illustrate, predict, and forecast the importance of the weights of decision-makers' judgments as well as the direct impact on the sustainability of DT production. © 2022 by the authors.

The technological revolution in supply chain logistics is experiencing a significant wave of new innovations and challenges. Despite the current fast digital technologies, customers expect the ordering and delivery process to be faster, and as a result, this has made it easier and more efficient for organizations looking to implement new technologies. “Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)”, which means using the Internet of Things to perform intelligent tasks with the help of artificial intelligence integration, is one of these expected innovations that can turn a complex supply chain into an integrated process. AIoT innovations such as data sensors and RFID (radio detection technology), with the power of artificial intelligence analysis, provide information to implement features such as tracking and instant alerts to improve decision making. Such data can become vital information to help improve operations and tasks. However, the same evolving technology with the presence of the Internet and the huge amount of data can pose many challenges for the supply chain and the factors involved. In this study, by conducting a literature review and interviewing experts active in FMCG industries as an available case study, the most important challenges facing the AIoT-powered supply chain were extracted. By examining these challenges using nonlinear quantitative analysis, the importance of these challenges was examined and their causal relationships were identified.

However, few studies have focused on studying the differences in the effects of types of customer service on customer purchase intentions. Based on service encounter theory and superposition theory, we designed two shopping experiments to capture customers’ thoughts and feelings, in order to explore the differences in the effects of three different types of online customer service (AI customer service, manual customer service, and human–machine collaboration customer service) on customer purchase intention, and analyses the superposition effect of human–machine collaboration customer service. The results show that the consumer’s perceived service quality positively influences the customer’s purchase intention, and plays a mediating role in the effect of different types of online customer service on customer purchase intention; the product type plays a moderating role in the relationship between online customer service and customer purchase intention, and human–machine collaboration customer service has a superposition effect. This study helped to deepen the understanding of AI developers and e-commerce platforms regarding the application of AI in online business service, and provides reference suggestions for the formulation of more perfect business service strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

Expressions such as digital transformation and digitalization of business are common in the communication channels of economic entities, which want to benefit from the advantages of information technology (artificial intelligence, software robots, and blockchain) to streamline their business. The aim of this research is to highlight the impact of the digitalization of accounting on the business environment, the work style, and the role of professional accountants: the paradigm shift. The study is based on theoretical research as well as empirical research based on a questionnaire applied in economic entities, and respondents are both decision makers and professional accountants. The results obtained by the statistical analysis of the questionnaire (Chi‐square, Crosstabulation, Friedman test) suggest that digitization is more than a conventional change, being equally about technology and people. The orientation towards digitalization implies, in addition to a well‐organized implementation plan, a change in the mentalities of the human factor corroborated with the evolution of the organizational culture of economic entities. At the same time, we are witnessing a change in the accounting paradigm, and the role of professional accountants is evolving from “transaction logger” to analyst and consultant for entrepreneurs. Research confirms that the digitalization of accounting is proving to be not only a modern solution, imposed by technological progress, but also timely, necessary, and even mandatory given the difficulty of anticipating the economic and social context due to the pandemic crisis. This study stands out both because of the innovative character of the approached subject, the digitalization of accounting, which represents a concept in full expansion, and because of its practical utility. This is proven by the analyses performed and the conclusions drawn in the context of an economic environment that is constantly looking for solutions. All operations can be moved to a controlled and accessible digital environment that can be accessed from any location. © 2022 by the author.

Many algorithms with different clustering approaches have been proposed in the literature. As they are easy and straightforward, partitioning methods such as K-means and K-medoids are the most commonly used algorithms. These are greedy methods that gradually improve clustering quality, highly dependent on initial parameters, and stuck a local optima. For this reason, in recent years, heuristic optimization methods have also been used in clustering. These heuristic methods can provide successful results because they have some mechanism to escape local optimums. In this study, for the first time, Artificial Algae Algorithm was used for clustering and compared with ten well-known bio-inspired metaheuristic clustering approaches. The proposed AAA clustering efficiency is evaluated using statistical analysis, convergence rate analysis, Wilcoxon’s test, and different cluster evaluating measures ranking on 25 well-known public datasets with different difficulty levels (features and instances). The results demonstrate that the AAA clustering method provides more accurate solutions with a high convergence rate than other existing heuristic clustering techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial algae algorithm; Clustering analysis; Data clustering","Biomimetics; Cluster analysis; Heuristic methods; Image recognition; K-means clustering; Optimization; Artificial alga algorithm; Bioinformation; Clustering analysis; Clustering approach; Clusterings; Convergence rates; Data clustering; Local optima; Partitioning methods; Web searches; Algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124820296

In this article, we develop this relational and context-dependent analysis, arguing that ethics should not be understood as abstract values or design decisions, but as socio-technical achievements, enacted in the practices of students, teachers and corporations. We propose that the ethics of using AI in education are political, involving the distribution of power, privilege and resources. To illustrate this, we trace the controversies that followed from an incident in which a student was misclassified as a cheat by an online proctoring platform during the Covid-19 lockdown, analysing this incident to reveal the socio-technical arrangements of academic integrity. We then show how Joan Tronto’s work on the ethics of care can help think about the politics of these socio-technical arrangements — that is, about historically constituted power relations and the delegation of responsibilities within these institutions. The paper concludes by setting the immediate need for restorative justice against the slower temporality of systemic failure, and inviting speculation that could create new relationships between universities, students, businesses, algorithms and the idea of academic integrity. © 2021, The Author(s).","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Care; Ethics; Higher education; Online proctoring",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124365371

Water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits, including improving water quality, water supply, aesthetics, urban cooling, spaces for recreation, and habitat for biodiversity. However, in most cities, investment in such systems has been relatively low, in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of WSUD projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses. We describe the development, testing and application of INFFEWS (Investment Framework For the Economics of Water Sensitive cities), an economic decision-support system for investment in WSUD projects. INFFEWS is based on a Benefit: Cost Analysis (BCA) framework and is consistent with standard BCA. A prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary-equivalent values of intangible (non-market) benefits from WSUD projects. Development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users, review of existing tools, and primary research over eight years (2013–2020).

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital technologies applications continue to emerge to enhance and improve novel ways of communication on social media platforms, particularly Instagram. Indeed, this has caused a change in the behavioral and social customer journey, where customers need to embrace a digital experience adoption. The AI applications primarily aim to study the shoppers browsing trend to draw new clients and expand businesses. Even the fashion industry has tapped into Instagram's business benefits in this fast-paced and competitive industry. With this quick and compelling way to capture shoppers’ attention towards fashion products, the purchase decision may differ between e-shoppers and conventional shoppers. AI seems to be extremely promising and has the potential to be a game changer for Instagram users, advertisers, and influencers. This study applies the Engel-Kollat-Blackwell (EKB) theory to investigate the effects of AI-based digital technology experiences on Instagrammers’ fashion apparel purchase decisions - perceived eWOM, perceived emotional value, perceived quality, perceived risk and perceived price. Based on data collected from Instagram users, the framework of this study was evaluated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Semi-structured in-depth interviews were also conducted as part of the research to get a more in-depth understanding of the profiles and behaviors of Instagram users. Our findings from both methodologies confirm that perceived emotional value, perceived quality, and perceived eWOM revealed a statistically significant and positive influence on Instagrammers’ purchase decisions for fashion apparel. Meanwhile, the importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) identified perceived emotional value as the most important factor for Instagrammers, but the highest performance was perceived quality. This research has important implications for Malaysian online retailers and shoppers to adapt to the fast-changing digital transformation. Assuredly, this study makes a noteworthy contribution to attitudinal research on social media commerce within the fashion industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI; Digital transformation; Fashion; Instagram; Purchase decision","Behavioral research; Quality control; Sales; Apparel industry; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Fashion; Fashion industry; Instagram; Online social networkings; Perceived quality; Purchase decision; Technological advancement; Social networking (online); artificial intelligence; clothing industry; competitiveness; decision making; social media; technological change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123988809

The oil industry has been following the path of several other industrial sectors and has implemented digitalization to solve different challenges and problems. The present work, supported by extensive research carried out in the specialized literature, shows relevant applications of digital transformation to solve problems in drilling and production operations during the life cycle of an oil well. The main issues addressed in the research were stuck pipes and hydrate formation. The achievements show that control systems and the various sensors used during drilling and the useful life of an oil well generate data that creates opportunities for the use of computational and artificial intelligence techniques. New technologies associated with digital transformation include smart surveillance systems, real-time monitoring, and intelligent equipment. In a well oil environment, these novelties are associated with fault detection and prediction systems to avoid or reduce problems or accidents that may cause costs or, in extreme cases, lead to the loss of the well. The study also points out that the oil industries, research centers, and universities are increasingly working together to understand the challenges and overcome the problems associated with the implementation and greater use of digital transformation technologies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Drilling; Oil and gas industry; Oil well; Production","Artificial intelligence; Chemical detection; Fault detection; Gas industry; Infill drilling; Life cycle; Oil wells; Artificial intelligence techniques; Artificial intelligence technologies; Business models; Digital transformation; Drilling operation; Industrial sector; Oil and Gas Industry; Oil industries; Production operations; Stuck pipe; Real time systems",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123497103

These digital technologies combined with business model innovation are deemed to provide solutions to myriad problems in the world, including those related to circular economy transformation. Given the societal and practical importance of CE and digitalisation, last decade has witnessed a significant increase in academic publication on these topics. Therefore, this study aims to capture the essence of the scholarly work at the intersection of the CE and digital technologies. A detailed analysis of the literature based on emerging themes was conducted with a focus on illuminating the path of CE implementation. The results reveal that IoT and AI play a key role in the transition towards the CE. A multitude of studies focus on barriers to digitalisation-led CE transition and highlight policy-related issues, the lack of predictability, psychological issues and information vulnerability as some important barriers. In addition, product-service system (PSS) has been acknowledged as an important business model innovation for achieving the digitalisation enabled CE. Through a detailed assessment of the existing literature, a viable systems-based framework for digitalisation enabled CE has been developed which show the literature linkages amongst the emerging research streams and provide novel insights regarding the realisation of CE benefits. © 2022 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Circular business model; Circular economy; Internet of things; Product-service system (PSS); Sustainability","Internet of things; Block-chain; Business model innovation; Business models; Circular business model; Circular economy; Digital technologies; Practical importance; Product-service system; Product-service systems; Systematic literature review; Artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence; business; economics; literature review; sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122932723

Where individuals have a wider range of decisions to influence, the consequence of decisions far more propagate across the system, and the business environment continually influences the status of the system. Predicting the cascading effects of decisions in such situations would be very problematic yet can have several implications for managers and executives to think beyond organizational silos and make local decision with a bigger picture of emergent consequences in mind. A prominent challenge within this realm is the ever-increasing complexity of decision propagations, especially when incorporating the role and influence of people involved in decision-making. This paper tackles this challenge from an engineering change perspective, with the focus on computing the compound risk of decisions when their consequences concurrently propagate across the system. We introduce an interactive tool called Virtual Net Propagator, which incorporates organizational dynamics into decision analysis, with the aim to identify change opportunities and effective set of interventions. Illustrated by a field engineering case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed tool can provide detailed knowledge on how decisions are interconnected and how systemic (cascading) effects of a decision propagate through causal pathways, so highlighting key influencers along with role and influence of interfacing (hidden) players. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Change propagation; Complex networks; Computational intelligence; Socio-technical systems; Systems design and analysis; Web-based decision support system","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Crack propagation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Business environments; Cascading effects; Change propagation; Cloud-based; Computational tools; Design and analysis; Organisational; Propagation analysis; Sociotechnical systems; Web-based decision support systems; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120459768

Yet algorithms often remain opaque to the decision makers and devoid of clear explanations for the decisions made. In this study, we used an experimental approach to compare decision making in three situations: humans making decisions (1) without any support of algorithms, (2) supported by business rules (BR), and (3) supported by machine learning (ML). Participants were asked to make the correct decisions given various scenarios, while BR and ML algorithms could provide correct or incorrect suggestions to the decision maker. This enabled us to evaluate whether the participants were able to understand the limitations of BR and ML. The experiment shows that algorithms help decision makers to make more correct decisions. The findings suggest that explainable AI combined with experience helps them detect incorrect suggestions made by algorithms. However, even experienced persons were not able to identify all mistakes. Ensuring the ability to understand and traceback decisions are not sufficient for avoiding making incorrect decisions. The findings imply that algorithms should be adopted with care and that selecting the appropriate algorithms for supporting decisions and training of decision makers are key factors in increasing accountability and transparency. © The Author(s) 2020.","accountability; AI; algorithmic governance; artificial intelligence; data-driven government; decision making; e-government; experiment; transparency; XAI",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098250018

Due to its possible applications, decision making is currently a broad field of study in many areas like Computation, Economics and Business Management. The first techniques appeared in scenarios where information was modeled by real numbers. In all cases, one of the key steps in such processes was the summarization of the available information into a few values that helped the decision maker to complete this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-criteria decision making methodology in the fuzzy context in which weights and experts’ opinions (may be translated by linguistic labels) are stated as triangular fuzzy numbers. To do that, we take advantage of a recently presented fuzzy binary relation whose properties are according to human intuition and we carry out a study of the main properties that an aggregation function (a mapping to sum up information) must satisfy in the fuzzy framework. The presented procedure makes a final decision based on parabolic fuzzy numbers (not triangular). And this will be shown in an illustrative example. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregation function; Decision making; Fuzzy binary relation; Fuzzy number; Fuzzy ranking","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Fuzzy rules; Aggregation functions; Business management; Fuzzy aggregation; Fuzzy binary relations; Linguistic labels; Multi criteria decision making; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Uncertain informations; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089918333

In order to provide more effective wireless communication and information processing support for the intelligent mining application of coal mines, the research and network construction status of 5G technology in theintelligentization of coal mines were investigated, and the progress of research and pilot construction in multiple aspects including theoretical research, standardization, and laboratory application of 5G technology in coal mines were analyzed. In view of both the wireless communication environment and service requirements, the coal mine 5G network planning scheme from the aspects of wireless frequency band selection, wireless base station selection, wireless networ⁃ king and core network construction were studied, and it was pointed out some network planning principles such as “unified planning, safe economy, universal coverage and fine design”. Then, the possible new scenarios of 5G in coal mines were summarized, and it was pro⁃ posed that 5G network slicing should coordinate the service matching granularity and further be refined based on the three basic scenarios of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) and massive Machine Type Communication(mMTC), in order to achieve optimum use network resources, which further refined the application scenarios of coal mines, and at the same time, coordinated the relationship between business matching granularity, slice management and network resources to achieve the best network resource utilization; it also studied coal mine 5G edge computing technology, designed a cloud-edge-end col⁃ laborative edge computing architecture for specific coal mine intelligent business needs, and conducted research on key technologies such as computing offloading and edge-cloud collaboration. The above analysis and research show that when commercial 5G is applied to the in⁃ telligent mining process of coal mines, network planning and network slicing are still required for specific application services and scenari⁃ os. Because 5G technology itself is constantly being updated and developed, it is necessary to continuously integrate new technologies in the process of integrating 5G and coal mine intelligence, and carefully evaluate the key technologies adopted and network design and con⁃ struction plans in the context of new technologies. © 2022 China Coal Society.

It is clearly an emotional process due to its complex and uncertain nature, and involves individuals’ emotion regulation, yet the current research lacks an effective conversion path from emotion to digital business model innovation (BMI). Drawing on theories and research on emotion regulation and business model innovation, we investigate how emotion regulation of entrepreneurs (i.e., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) influence digital BMI. Data from 126 new ventures show that entrepreneurs’ reappraisal positively affects digital BMI, while entrepreneurs’ suppression exerts opposite effects on digital BMI. Moreover, we find that environmental dynamism moderates this relationship.

In spite of its significance, there is scant attention to conceptualising and empirically investigating FMAC and its consequences in a data-driven business context. Thus, this study aims to develop and test a conceptual model that relates FMAC and its repercussions in the data-rich business environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the data from 250 managers amongst large and medium-sized manufacturing and service-intensive firms. Furthermore, this research performed an empirical study by using operationalised questionnaire survey method to verify the hypotheses and reach its theoretical and managerial implications. Structural equation modelling with maximum-likelihood estimation method was applied to verify the validity of the proposed research model. Findings: Multivariate analysis results show that FMAC significantly influences firms' competitive marketing performance (FCMP) with the presence of holistic marketing decision-making (HMDM) as a mediator. Moreover, adoption of artificial intelligence (AAI) enhances the relationship of FMAC-HMDM and FMAC-FCMP linkages. Practical implications: This study analyses how FMAC can enhance FCMP and contributes to resource-based views and technological capability theories. From a managerial perspective, guidelines are provided for marketers to adopt advance technologies, such as AI, to optimise FMAC and HMDM to achieve competitive marketing performance. Originality/value: Believing that “how to be competitive in marketing performance under data-rich-environment”, this research is the first to use the data of a firm manager to facilitate the understanding of FMAC, which provides a new direction for improving marketing performance.

The final goal is to report to experts a meaningful description of the most impactful events occurring around the world, to help them in their daily decision-making. Design / Methodology / Approach: This work results from a cross-fertilization between business management, Information Technology and Computer science. This work relies on an expert analysis and advanced AI engines, including a case study on a specific raw material and a literature review to define the parameters to supervise. Results: We propose a general architecture based on IT and business synergy. We conduce a general study on the factors influencing raw materials price fluctuations, namely events influencing supply and demand of the commodity. Finally, we present a case study of the events, which historically affected phosphates prices. Limitations of the investigation: An in-depth knowledge of the domain is needed to analyze and quantify the events impact on the supply chain. Practical implications: This approach was first designed for assisting raw material purchasers but it can potentially be reproduced to assist other decision-makers. Originality / Value: We propose a new approach on how to anticipate the implications of external events on supply chain disruption and raw materials price evolution.

One of the major obstacles for the plants to optimally produce crops based on their capacity is caused by the presence of noxious weeds in the plantation area. However, weed control via chemical processes may potentially harm the surrounding environment if it is not properly managed. Therefore, an automatic system to assist the farmers to identify and control the weeds is required to minimize harmful impacts on the environment. Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems provide powerful tools to perform such tasks. In this work, we aim for an ML-based system design to perform an automatic weed recognition task. The methodology can provide an effort for environmental sustainability in oil palm plantations. The weed identification involves the description, the local names, and tolerance class of the weeds as well as suggestions to control them. The flow of this work consists of weed and herbicide data acquisition, data labeling, model configurations, and data training. Further, the proposed system can be adopted as an android-based application in mobile devices that can deploy the trained model to predict weed category in both real-time and non-real-time tasks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127290293

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to solve a variety of data science challenges. The prediction of a result based on existing data is a typical use of machine learning. Diagnosing heart disease is a difficult process that takes a great deal of expertise and knowledge. Traditional methods of forecasting heart illness include hospital examination or a variety of medicinal checks. The health-care business has a massive amount of health-care data, much of which are buried. This concealed knowledge can help you make better decisions. For the best outcomes, computer-based data are combined with modern data mining techniques. The neural network is a widely utilized tool for predicting the diagnosis of heart disease. There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccination increases the risk of heart attack. However, it is being used as “proof” that the vaccine kills in social media posts. As a result, we investigated this issue by incorporating ‘infected with coronavirus’ and ‘coronavirus vaccine’ as additional criteria for improved accuracy. This study describes a proposed artificial neural network model to predict a heart attack. The technology makes predictions based on eight medical characteristics. The current study's findings demonstrated that the model developed using the artificial neural network efficiently predicts a patient’s heart attack.

Business Lead scoring involves assigning a score (i.e., a buying probability) to each possible lead generated for the business. The interactions of these leads with the business marketing channels across the internet are converted into multiple attributes, including useful pieces of information (e.g., contact details, lead source, channel) and behavioral hints (e.g., reply speed, motion tracking). This process can help assess the quality of the opportunity and its position in the purchasing process. Furthermore, an accurate lead scoring process can help marketing and sales teams prioritize the selected leads and appropriately respond to them within an optimal time frame, increasing their propensity to become clients. The use of machine learning algorithms can help to automate this process. In this paper, the authors compared the performances of various ML algorithms to predict lead scores.

AI introduces new ways of doing jobs and business, and of exploring new global market opportuni-ties. However, on the other hand, it provides many challenges to comprehend. Therefore, our study’s main objective was to examine the behavioral, cultural, ethical, social, and economic challenges of AI-enabled products and services in consumer markets and discuss how businesses might shape their approaches to address AI-related ethical issues. AI offers numerous social, ethical, and behavioral difficulties for people, organizations, and societies that endanger the sustainable development of economies. These fundamental challenges due to AI technologies have raised serious questions for the sustainable development of electronic markets. Based on this, the current study presents a framework highlighting these issues. Systematic reviewing was our research method; we looked for explicit information and methods that indicate the credibility of research or reduce biases. This paper is of great importance, as it highlights several behavioral, societal, ethical, and cultural aspects in electronic markets which were not presented in previous studies. Some key issues are the security and privacy of consumers, AI biases, individual autonomy, wellbeing, and issues of unemployment. Therefore, companies that use AI systems need to be socially responsible and make AI systems as secure as possible to promote the sustainable development of countries. The results suggest that AI has undoubtedly transformed life and has both positive and negative effects. However, the main aim regarding AI should be to use it for the overall goals of humanity. Moreover, authorities operating in e-business environments need to create proper rules and regulations and make the systems as secure as possible for people. © 2022 by the authors.

Among the fascinating lessons from these times is the huge potential of data analytics and artificial intelligence. The crisis exponentially accelerated the adoption of analytics and artificial intelligence, and this momentum is predicted to continue into the 2020s and beyond. Drug development is a costly and time-consuming business, and only a minority of approved drugs generate returns exceeding the research and development costs. As a result, there is a huge drive to make drug discovery cheaper and faster. With modern algorithms and hardware, it is not too surprising that the new technologies of artificial intelligence and other computational simulation tools can help drug developers.

In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity. As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. This monograph comprises the following four sections: • First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field. • Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews. • Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics. • Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education. © 2022 S. Moon and D. Iacobucci",,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126476246

The pandemic made governments worldwide stay under lock-downs to prevent virus transmissions. Reports show that wearing face masks would reduce the risk of transmission. With the rise in population in cities, there is a greater need for efficient city management in today’s world for reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease. For smart cities to prosper, significant improvements to occur in public transportation, roads, businesses, houses, city streets, and other facets of city life will have to be developed. The current public bus transportation system, such as it is, should be expanded with artificial intelligence. The autonomous mask detection and alert system are needed to find whether the person is wearing a face mask or not. This article presents a novel IoT-based face mask detection system in public transportation, especially buses. This system would collect real-time data via facial recognition. The main objective of the paper is to detect the presence of face masks in real-time video stream by utilizing deep learning, machine learning, and image processing techniques. To achieve this objective, a hybrid deep and machine learning model was designed and implemented. The model was evaluated using a new dataset in addition to public datasets. The results showed that the transformation of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier has better performance over the Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier; it has almost complete face-identification capabilities with respect to people’s presence in the case where they are wearing masks, with an error rate of only 1.1%. Overall, compared with the standard models, AlexNet, Mobinet, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), the proposed model showed a better performance. Moreover, the experiments showed that the proposed model can detect faces and masks accurately with low inference time and memory, thus meeting the IoT limited resources. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite growing pressure, understanding of the current situation and development vectors is largely missing. In this study, circular economy workshops were arranged for six industrial companies manufacturing electronics and operating in Finland to obtain an empirical understanding of the current state of circular economy implementation. During the workshops, each company assessed the state of the circular economy for a chosen product using a set of 51 circular economy strategies, i.e., the circularity deck. The results indicated that circular economy principles were implemented in only 25% of the cases. This is mostly related to the production of smaller, thinner, and lighter products. The results also indicate a large improvement potential of 36% for the participating companies. This is the share of cases that are planned for implementation. Those strategies mostly relate to the use of recycled inputs, the development of products made of a single material, and the design of products suitable for primary recycling. The least relevant or even irrelevant strategies were those related to the use of information technologies and artificial intelligence, despite electronic products being the enablers of such strategies for the other companies. Therefore, to further increase the circularity of electronic products and to meet the demands and interests of the manufacturing industry, research work on the technologies and services enabling the use of waste as raw materials should be emphasized to close the loops. Finally, the results imply the necessity for a more widespread assessment of circular economy strategies among companies, with consequent development of action plans for their implementation. © 2022 by the authors.

The most important issue in intelligent manufacturing is to maintain a high utilization rate of pro-duction. On the one hand, for maintaining high utilization, the production line must have enough materials at any time; on the other hand, too many materials in stock would greatly increase the operating cost of the factory. Therefore, maintaining sufficient inventory while avoiding excessive inventory is an important key issue in intelligent manufacturing. After the factory receives the or-der, it would issue the manufacturing order to the production line for manufacturing. The capacities of different production lines are different. If the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system based on the IoT framework can be used to monitor the capacity of each production line, in addition to estimating the capacity, the usage of key materials can also be accurately estimated through AI; when the quantity of key materials is below the safety stock, the manufacturer can actively notify the supplier and request for replenishment. This is a Customer-to-Business (C2B) safety stock management model (i.e., the vendor-managed inventory, VMI), which combines AI and IoT. In particular, in the case of consumer electronics, because their life cycles are short and they are vulnerable to market fluctuations, the manufacturer must adjust the production capacity. This study will propose to construct a SCADA system based on the IoT, including the capacity of the production line, materials inventory, and downstream order requirements, and use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to accurately predict inventory requirements. In this study, through the factory, a SCADA system based on AI and IoT will be constructed to monitor the factory’s manufacturing capacity and predict the product sales of downstream manufacturers, for the purpose of facilitating the analysis and decision-making of safety stock. In addition to effectively reducing the inventory level, in essence, the purpose of this study is to enhance the competitiveness of the overall production and sales ecosystem, and to achieve the goal of digital transformation of manufacturing with AI and IoT. © 2022 by the authors.

Digital transformation (DT) redefined the industrial structures and reinvented business models. Hence, in the face of Industry 4.0, financial and accounting services face new threats, challenges, and opportunities. How do the business players in the accounting sector perceive this phenomenon? This paper aims to answer this question by following a qualitative and exploratory approach, applied to three case studies, using semi-structured interviews. The study shows that although digital transformation in Portuguese small and medium-sized accounting service enterprises is just starting, Industry 4.0 technologies, optical character recognition (OCR), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and enterprise resource planning (ERP) in the cloud were the technologies singled out by respondents. Resistance to change, organisational culture and price seem to be the main barriers to DT in accounting. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the role of accounting and accountants in organisations and society in the context of the digital era. Moreover, it provides practical insights into the potential relationship between technological (specifically digital) development and labour market dynamics for accounting professionals. © 2022 by the authors.

As a second cardinal messenger, adenosine 3’, 5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) is a nucleotide active in a multitude of signal pathways. The other messengers have greater involvement in the drug receptors or receptor–ligand, decreased protein activation, and less neural pathway regulation. cAMP is a promising second messenger because it controls the activity of various proteins and enzymes and makes it a second effective messenger with greater concentration in most body tissues. Local cAMP signals have become recognized worldwide in four major diseases: cancer, cataracts, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, cAMP’s current status and statics relative to its characteristics were here attempted, involving simple synthesis in different directions. A few additional cAMP-play positions are now known as the second messenger and new finders in this field and experiences with cAMP and medicaments such as salmeterol, theophylline, metoprolol, desmopressin, morphine, and ranitidine.

PSS customization entails configuring products with varying degrees of differentiation to meet the needs of various customers. This is combined with service customization, in which configured products are expanded by customers to include smart IoT devices (e.g., sensors) to improve product usage and facilitate the transition to smart connected products. The concept of PSS customization is gaining significant interest; however, there are still numerous challenges that must be addressed when designing and offering customized PSSs, such as choosing the optimum types of sensors to install on products and their adequate locations during the service customization process. In this paper, we propose a data warehouse-based recommender system that collects and analyzes large volumes of product usage data from similar products to the product that the customer needs to customize by adding IoT smart devices. The analysis of these data helps in identifying the most critical parts with the highest number of incidents and the causes of those incidents. As a result, sensor types are determined and recommended to the customer based on the causes of these incidents. The utility and applicability of the proposed RS have been demonstrated through its application in a case study that considers the rotary spindle units of a CNC milling machine. © 2022 by the authors.

This work aims to improve maritime shipping companies by introducing digitalization in their operations. This objective is achieved analyzing the impact of maritime container shipping companies’ digitalization. This analysis requires as input the Business Process Model (BPMo) and an inventory of digital applications to verify how the BPMo changes when deploying the applications, define the prerequisites necessary for this deployment, and identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) to track it. The impact of the deployment of the applications has been quantified by using four performance dimensions: Costs, Time, Quality, and Flexibility. The results show that the impacts are different per application, with changes in the processes, the addition of new ones, and the decommissioning of others. The impact of digitalization is high when trying to deploy all the applications at the same time. Companies can leverage this work, which requires reviewing the documented impacts in their processes and the applications’ prerequisites as well as updating their existing balanced scorecard, incorporating the application’s KPIs. A list of 10 applications has been identified as “quick wins”; then, applications can be the starting point for digitalizing a company. © 2022 by the authors.

On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are known to “keep learning” as the data increase. In this context, our research question emerges: what AI-based methods, in the literature, could be used to automatize business processes and support the decision-making processes of companies? To fill this gap, in this paper, we performed a review of the literature to identify these techniques. We ensured the usage of methods since they allowed reproducibility and extensions. We applied our search string in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and discovered 21 relevant papers pertaining to our question. In these papers, we identified methods that automated tasks and helped analysts make assertive decisions when designing, extending, or reengineering business processes. The authors applied diverse AI techniques, such as K-means, Bayesian networks, and swarm intelligence. Our analysis provides statistics about the techniques and problems being tackled and point to possible future directions. © 2022 by the authors.

It is extremely important to bring together all the alternative frames of thinking—from the various communities of developers, researchers, business leaders, policymakers, and citizens—to properly start acknowledging AI. This article highlights the ‘fruitful collaboration’ that sociology and AI could develop in both social and technical terms. We discuss how biases and unfairness are among the major challenges to be addressed in such a sociotechnical perspective. First, as intelligent machines reveal their nature of ‘magnifying glasses’ in the automation of existing inequalities, we show how the AI technical community is calling for transparency and explainability, accountability and contestability. Not to be considered as panaceas, they all contribute to ensuring human control in novel practices that include requirement, design and development methodologies for a fairer AI. Second, we elaborate on the mounting attention for technological narratives as technology is recognized as a social practice within a specific institutional context. Not only do narratives reflect organizing visions for society, but they also are a tangible sign of the traditional lines of social, economic, and political inequalities. We conclude with a call for a diverse approach within the AI community and a richer knowledge about narratives as they help in better addressing future technical developments, public debate, and policy. AI practice is interdisciplinary by nature and it will benefit from a socio-technical perspective. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accountability; Artificial intelligence; Human control; Inequalities; Narratives; Sociology; Transparency","Artificial intelligence; Accountability; Business leaders; Glasses In; Human control; Inequality; Intelligent machine; Narrative; Policy makers; Socio-technical perspective; Technical terms; Transparency",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124016925

Our approach consists of three stages in which we combine and use three different datasets: numerical data on orders, textual after-purchase reviews and socio-geo-demographic data from the census. At the pre-processing stage, we find topics from text reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture and Gibbs sampling. In the spatial analysis, we apply DBSCAN to get rural/urban locations and analyse neighbourhoods of customers located with zip codes. At the modelling stage, we apply machine learning extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression. The quality of models is verified with area-under-curve and lift metrics. Explainable artificial intelligence represented with a permutation-based variable importance and a partial dependence profile help to discover the determinants of churn. We show that customers’ propensity to churn depends on: (i) payment value for the first order, number of items bought and shipping cost; (ii) categories of the products bought; (iii) demographic environment of the customer; and (iv) customer location. At the same time, customers’ propensity to churn is not influenced by: (i) population density in the customer’s area and division into rural and urban areas; (ii) quantitative review of the first purchase; and (iii) qualitative review summarised as a topic. © 2022 by the authors.

The production of the high number of satellites involved in modern mega-constellations is bringing in the space industry the necessity of improved and optimized manufacturing approaches suitable for serial production, i.e., standard environment/high number of platforms. In this framework, the adoption of Industry 4.0 methodologies within the space industry will lead to a significant improvement and optimization of the whole Manufacturing Assembly Integration and Testing (MAIT) cycle. The main aim of Industry 4.0 is the creation of intelligent factories where manufacturing technologies are upgraded and transformed by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics with predictive monitoring features. Main element of the Industry 4.0 approach is the synergic use of embedded sensing technologies in the frame of intelligent production processes, fostering a radical evolution of the industrial values chains, production value chains, and business models. In the present work, a possible application of the Industry 4.0 concepts to space industry is presented and discussed in terms of applicability and obtainable advantages. As a case study, the composite sandwich panel manufacturing line of RUAG Space is considered. Particular focus will be given to the development of a CPS, by establishing a control network of sensors (e.g. temperature, location, load) over a targeted MAIT process. © 2021 IAA","Artificial intelligence; Cyber-physical systems; Digital twin; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Mega constellations; Smart manufacturing; Space 4.0; Space Systems MAIT","Cyber Physical System; Data Analytics; Honeycomb structures; Integration testing; Internet of things; Predictive analytics; Sandwich structures; Case-studies; Composite sandwich panels; Large scale productions; Manufacturing assembly; Mega constellation; Smart manufacturing; Space 4.0; Space industry; Space system manufacturing assembly integration and testing; Space systems; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121914980

The emerging business model of today therefore appears to be one where autonomous algorithms are gradually expanding their occupation into becoming a leading decision-maker, and humans by default become increasingly more subordinate to such decisions. We address the question of whether this business perspective is consistent with the sort of collaboration employees want to have with algorithms at work. We explored this question by investigating in what way humans preferred to collaborate with algorithms when making decisions. Using two experimental studies (Study 1, n = 237; Study 2, n = 684), we show that humans consider the collaboration with autonomous algorithms as unfair when the algorithm leads decision-making and will even incur high financial costs in order to avoid this. Our results also show that humans do not want to exclude algorithms entirely but seem to prefer a 60–40% human–algorithm partnership. These findings contrast the position taken by today’s emerging business model on the issue of automated organizational decision-making. Our findings also provide support for the existence of an implicit theory—held by both present and future employees—that humans should lead and algorithms follow. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Collaboration; Fairness; Follower; Human; Leader",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120375286

Those processes are implemented in business process management systems (BPMS), which mostly support manual adaptations. That means that the process users have to detect what changes in the environment require process adaptation, and what adaptation operations have to be performed. Such manual adaptations of processes are costly, time-consuming and error prone tasks. For this reason, some contributions of the literature have tried to address the issue of self-adaptations of processes. But these contributions suffer from shortcomings: isolated use of adaptation techniques, non-coverage of the process dimensions and of the adaptation types, etc.; the adaptation issue remains partially addressed. Thus we recommend in this paper a hybrid approach to ensure autonomic adaptations of running processes. According to this approach, the Plan component tries to find an appropriate model version of the concerned process. Then, if such a version does not exist, it looks to reuse an adaptation case that was applied in the past under a similar situation (context). Finally, if necessary, it applies rules, as an artificial intelligence planning technique, to define an ad hoc adaptation. Moreover, the recommended approach takes advantage of the IBM MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute—Knowledge) control loop from autonomic computing, recognized as a prominent solution for self-adaptation at run-time. More precisely the paper addresses the resolution of adaptation needs while covering three process dimensions and all adaptation types and ensuring the separation of concerns for better portability and wide usability through the BPMN standard. It presents both the required Knowledge and the Plan component of the control loop for this resolution. It also shows the effectiveness of the approach by illustrating self-adaptation of a process from the crisis domain, and demonstrates its feasibility by reporting about its implementation and qualitative and quantitative evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation case; Autonomic processes; Context; MAPE-K; Rule; Self-adaptation; Version","Adaptation case; Autonomic process; Autonomics; Business Process; Context; Hybrid approach; Monitor, analyze, plan, execute—knowledge; Rule; Self- adaptations; Version",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119960493

The current study focuses on AI assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa) and a novel behavior – shopping via AI assistants – called voice shopping. The voice interaction between users and AI assistants features an unbalanced mode wherein users command their AI assistants to perform various tasks. We examine how the power experience in human-AI interaction impacts voice shopping. Our two-wave longitudinal data reveal that perceived power over AI assistants can reduce risk perception regarding voice shopping. The results of polynomial modeling and response surface analysis show that when perceived power fits desire for power, users perceive less risk and are more willing to shop via AI assistants. Our findings suggest that developers should be attentive to the match between power experience and desire for power when developing voice shopping functionalities. Our study also indicates that users could be vulnerable to the manipulation of the power experience by AI companies, which is of critical importance for policy-makers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Human-AI interaction; Individual-technology fit; Power experience; Voice shopping","Consumer behavior; Risk assessment; Surface analysis; 'current; Artificial intelligence systems; Business practitioners; Consumer choice; Human-artificial intelligence interaction; Individual technology; Individual-technology fit; Power; Power experience; Voice shopping; Risk perception; article; artificial intelligence; consumer; human; risk perception; shopping; surface property; voice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119289079

Automated Planning is one of the core areas of Artificial Intelligence where theoretical investigations and concrete and robust tools have made possible the reasoning about dynamic systems and domains. Moreover planning techniques are gaining popularity in the context of BPM. Starting from these observations, we provide here a concrete framework for formal verification of reachability properties on an expressive, yet empirically tractable class of data-aware process models, an extension of Workflow Nets. Then we provide a rigorous mapping between the semantics of such models and that of three important Automated Planning paradigms: Action Languages, Classical Planning, and Model-Checking.

Moreover, the ultimate goal of pursuing accuracy and efficiency improvement to better promote the application of data-driven computation has never changed. Since the main method to improve the accuracy of these tasks (e.g., the model training of machine learning) is to increase the diversity of datasets, this requires multiple data providers to share their data. However, data providers, e.g., private companies, are reluctant to share their datasets directly, considering the privacy protection of user information and the leakage prevention of their business secrets. Therefore, how to securely and efficiently perform joint datasets based data-driven computation tasks has become the main problem. In this work, without getting the aid of any trusted-third party (e.g., the cloud server), we construct an efficient maliciously secure two-party mixed-protocol framework for data-driven computation tasks. In particular, we construct a new cryptography gadget called committed oblivious linear evaluation (C-OLE) based on the homomorphic commitments in the malicious model. Then we construct two types of share conversion protocols in the malicious model with the above C-OLE gadget to construct the two-party mixed-protocol framework for data-driven computation tasks.

Aim: Although more than 160 guidelines have been proposed globally, it remains uncertain whether they are sufficient to meet the governance challenges of AI. Given the absence of a holistic theoretical framework to analyze the potential risk of AI, it is difficult to determine what is overestimated and what is missing in the extant guidelines. Based on the classic theoretical model in the field of risk management, we developed a four-dimensional structure as a benchmark to analyze the risk of AI and its corresponding governance measures. The structure consists of four pairs of risks: specific-general, legal-ethical, individual-collective and generational-transgenerational. Method: Using the framework, a comparative study of the extant guidelines is conducted by coding the 123 guidelines with 1023 articles. Result: We find that the extant guidelines are eccentric, while collective risk and generational risk are largely underestimated by stakeholders. Based on this analysis, three gaps and conflicts are outlined for future improvements. © 2021, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.","Artificial Intelligence; Categorization; Eccentricity; H83; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109334185

Using data from the China Employer-Employee Survey (CEES), this article examines the impact of digital management capabilities on the innovation performance of manufacturing companies. The results show that the enhancement of digital management capabilities can significantly promote the innovation performance of manufacturing enterprises, and this effect is robust. Dimensional regression results show that the availability of data in the decision-making process, the degree of data dependence in the decision-making process, the diversity of corporate data collection entities, and the frequency of use of work process data can significantly promote corporate innovation performance, while the influence of the frequency of data using in the decision-making process and the frequency of data use in the decision-making process and the frequency of using statistical methods to predict on the innovation performance of manufacturing enterprises is not obvious. Sub-sample regression results show that the effect of digital management capabilities on the innovation performance of manufacturing enterprises is heterogeneous. Specifically, when the company is characterized as with a long life span, with a large scale, with the type of family business, with a high proportion of CEOs who owned a college degree or above, with a high number of years of education for middle and senior managers, with a board of directors or a party organization, with a location of the eastern region or in the areas of a high concentration of financial services and R&D services, the effect of digital management capabilities on innovation performance is more obvious.

Yet AI is not a simple substitute for human decision-making. The advances in commercial machine learning that are reducing the costs of statistical prediction are simultaneously increasing the value of data (which enable prediction) and judgment (which determines why prediction matters). But these key complements—quality data and clear judgment—may not be present, or present to the same degree, in the uncertain and conflictual business of war. This has two important strategic implications. First, military organizations that adopt AI will tend to become more complex to accommodate the challenges of data and judgment across a variety of decision-making tasks. Second, data and judgment will tend to become attractive targets in strategic competition. As a result, conflicts involving AI complements are likely to unfold very differently than visions of AI substitution would suggest. Rather than rapid robotic wars and decisive shifts in military power, AI-enabled conflict will likely involve significant uncertainty, organizational friction, and chronic controversy. Greater military reliance on AI will therefore make the human element in war even more important, not less. © 2022 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125542686

Views about the role of AI in social change remain nevertheless controversial; on the one hand, it poses major ethical challenges and on the other hand, it is believed to be a tool for social good. The journey from assisted, to augmented, then to autonomous intelligence is part of a growing trend thus transforming firms into AI-fueled organizations. Among scholars and practitioners, there is a mounting recognition of the need to understand the potential collaboration of humans and machines and its implications for organizations. Method: We draw on the Sociomateriality theory and on Serres’ ontological view of the quasi-object/quasi-subject to explain the interplay between the social and the material in organizational settings. We propose a four-dimensional model that profiles future organizations populated with humanized machines and augmented humans. Results: We propose a new ontological perspective for the understanding of ultimate Sociomateriality, extending the sociomateriality theory. We contribute to organizational development theory through discussing the implications of ultimate sociomateriality for organizational practices, and through proposing the 4E matrix with the four dimensions for AI-fueled organizations. Conclusion: We shed the light on the interaction of the social and the material in the AI era. We proposed a theoretical development of the ultimate Sociomateriality theory based on Serres’ philosophy, as well as a four-dimensional matrix (4E matrix) which profiles AI-fueled and quasi-human populated organizations. Practically, we inform technology providers to create AI machines that serve humanity and organizations instead of destroying it, and inform public policy makers and NGOs to act as regulators for human rights, highlighting the need to rethink business education to develop human skills while redefining human roles within organizations in order to avoid being ravaged by the AI revolution. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.","Artificial Intelligence; Human-machine Collaboration; Quasi-human; Quasiobject/Quasi-subject; Ultimate Sociomateriality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128455441

Though it has been an emerging issue in the industrial and business world, very few studies has been undertaken in the Nepalese case. In this context, the study accesses the industrial readiness for the adoption of I4.0 in Kathmandu valley, Nepal. Explanatory Exploratory research design was adopted to examine if variables chosen actually affect industrial readiness and data was collected through structured questionnaires using both descriptive and inferential statistics via Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Adopting the census method to collect data, a total of 287 industries located in three industrial estates were taken as a population. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. The study found that the major problem while adopting I4.0 is the lack of skilled manpower in the industrial sector. In addition, we found people, customers, and culture, strategy and leadership, governance and operations have a significant effect on technology innovation decision making. Similarly, government intervention plays a significant mediation role between dependent and independent variables. Furthermore, this study found industries in Nepal are not ready for I4.0 as they are not implementing any enabling technology that enables industry 4.0. These results will support managers/policymakers in recognizing the strategic actions that can be embraced in order to improve the company's readiness level to seek the optimum benefits from the adoption of I4.0 paradigms. © 2022 The Author(s)","Industries' readiness; Industry 4.0; Nepalese industries; Structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125474400

Optimizing the scheduling strategy only from a single aspect cannot meet the needs of power business. At the same time, the power information system deployed on the security cloud will face different types of business traffic, and each business traffic has different risk levels. However, the existing research has not conducted in-depth research on this aspect, so it is difficult to obtain the optimal scheduling scheme. To solve the above problems, we first build a security cloud task-scheduling model combined with the power information system, and then we define the risk level of business traffic and the objective function of task scheduling. Based on the above, we propose a multi-objective optimization task-scheduling algorithm based on artificial fish swarm algorithm (MOOAFSA). MOOAFSA initializes the fish population through chaotic mapping, which improves the global optimization capability. Moreover, MOOAFSA uses a dynamic step size and field of view, as well as the introduction of adaptive weight factor, which accelerates the convergence and improves optimization accuracy. Finally, MOOAFSA applies crossovers and mutations, which make it easier to jump out of a local optimum. The experimental results show that compared with ant colony (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA), MOOAFSA not only significantly accelerates the convergence speed but also reduces the task-completion time, load balancing and execution cost by 15.62–28.69%, 66.91–75.62% and 32.37–41.31%, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

The entrepreneurship patterns analysis was carried out using a customized artificial neural network considering as inputs the self-assessment of multiple intelligences from an interdisciplinary perspective. Thus, many important findings reveal that not all multiple intelligences have a direct and proportional impact on entrepreneurship intention. In fact, Linguistic–Verbal Intelligence, Intrapersonal Intelligence, and Interpersonal intelligence are the types of intelligence that have the greatest influence on entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, the performance metrics of the ANN for classifying the entrepreneurship intentions are higher than the ones reported in the literature (i.e., accuracy ≈ 99.29%, precision ≈ 98.89%, sensitivity ≈ 99.53%, and specificity ≈ 99.01%). The paper contributes to the literature on the deep understanding of entrepreneurs’ behavior concerning the strengths and weaknesses of their multiple intelligences. Besides, this interdisciplinary empirical work contributes to improving the design of methods and techniques to strengthen entrepreneurship from the earliest stages of students’ lives and promote sustainable businesses. The most surprising finding was the minimal relationship of Naturalistic Intelligence to undertake sustainable and robust projects, which demands more detailed and in-depth analysis. Finally, some proposals are presented to improve the teaching process of entrepreneurship and sustainability, considering the artificiality, sustainability, and entrepreneurship involved in academic programs at universities. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these solutions are inadequate to provide simulations for verifying a possibility of reducing the total product cost through changes in the product design phase. The proposed approach provides a framework for identifying possible variants of changes in product design that can reduce the cost related to the production and after‐sales phase. This paper is concerned with using business analytics to cost estimation and simulation regarding changes in product design. The cost of a new product is estimated using analogical and parametric models that base on artificial neural networks. Relationships identified by computational intelligence are used to prepare cost estimation and simulations. A model of product development, production process, and admissible resources is described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem that is effectively solved using constraint programming techniques. The proposed method enables the selection of a more appropriate technique to cost estimation, the identification of a set of possible changes in product design towards reducing the total product cost, and it is the framework for developing a decision support system. In this aspect, it outperforms current methods dedicated for evaluating the potential of a new product. © 2022 by the authors.

(2) Methods: Surveys were distributed to 578 participants in selected international companies in Turkey, Taiwan, Japan, and China. To reduce uncertainty and errors, the surveys were rigorously evaluated and did not show a normal distribution, as it was determined that 85 participants did not consciously fill out the questionnaires, and the questionnaires from the remaining 493 participants were used. By using the evaluation model of employee satisfaction based on a back propagation (BP) neural network, we explored the manifestation and impact of abusive management and self-efficacy. Using the listed real estate businesses as an example, we proposed a deep learning BP neural network-based employee job satisfaction evaluation model and a human–machine technology-based employee performance evaluation system under situational perception, according to the design requirements of human– machine interaction. (3) Results: The results show that the human–machine interface can log in according to the correct verbal instructions of the employees. In terms of age and education level variables, employees’ perceptions of leaders’ abusive management and self-efficacy are significantly different from their job performances, respectively (p < 0.01).

This capability is further highlighted in Ad Hoc Multimodal Service Systems (AHMSSs), where service instances rarely follow a standard form of service delivery and exist only for a limited time. However, due to the increasing scale and frequency of services in many business and public sectors, meeting the desired level of capability has become troublesome. A well-designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach can be a solution to the difficulty by addressing the underlying complexity and uncertainty of the AHMSS design process. To conceptualize and foster AI applications to an AHMSS, this study identifies key decision-making problems in the AHMSS design process and discusses the role of AI in the process.

There is much focus on the topic of sustainability in business, finance, climate, health, water and education; however, there are some challenges when sustainability needs to be integrated into engineering or fundamental study programs (SPs). In the latter, sustainability is more often emphasized and implemented through its general principles or separate modules in social sciences and project activities. There are a number of questions and challenges in how to highlight sustainability aspects and evaluation metrics due to the specifics of the engineering study field. For evaluating the sustainability level in engineering studies, a hierarchical methodology employing the SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition) model is proposed, taking a technological university in Lithuania as the case study.

As one of the biggest barriers in new business model implementation, the lack of strategy and workforce skills is frequently mentioned in the literature. The high level of investments it requires and the perception of high risks with unclear future benefits can be avoided with readiness factor calculation. This paper presents a novel model for readiness factor calculation, oriented to process planning and based on decision support systems. The model enables the definition of the optimal strategic plan for the digitization with the use of decision support systems (analytic hierarchy process) and through the use of statistical methods implemented within the model it minimizes the influence of human subjectivity and quantification of qualitative criteria. This innovative approach enables the understanding of the transition process to new technology-enabled business models, in this case oriented towards process planning. The useability and reliability of the model is proven in a case study of a metal machining company. © 2022 by the authors.

We draw on resource orchestration theory to examine the effects of business analytics and π-shaped skills on a firm's innovative performance, and the moderating role of π-shaped skills. Field data (n = 450) were obtained from individuals with supervisory positions in large Saudi firms and SMEs and analyzed with PLS-SEM and fsQCA techniques. PLS-SEM results reveal that business analytics and π-shaped skills are relevant antecedents for innovative performance. However, the expected moderating role of π-shaped skills on the relationship between business analytics and innovative performance did not hold. FsQCA results reveal that business analytics and π-shaped skills are sufficient but not necessary conditions for high innovative performance. This paper contributes not only to empirical evidence, but also to theory by furthering our understanding of the emergent π-shaped skills concept. Our findings echo the need to expand inquiry into business analytics and skill sets capabilities for better innovative outputs.

In contrast to previous eco-innovation research, a nascent methodology involving a dual-stage hybrid analysis and an emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, deep learning was used to analyze 683 viable responses from Ghanaian manufacturing firms. Some intriguing conclusions were discovered where the dimensions of sustainable business performance are achievable vis-à-vis the implementation of product, process, and organizational eco-innovation. Notably, a manufacturing firm's environmental performance can be considerably improved by implementing the triumvirate of product, process, and organizational eco-innovation. Subsequently, a firm can improve its social performance by R&D investment in eco-innovations, novel green management practices and staff sensitization on eco-innovation. Lastly, market turbulence (technology and environmental turbulence) in the form of technological advancements, intense market competition, changing household demand and taste amplifies the positive effect of product and organizational eco-innovation on the economic dimension of sustainable performance.

In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions.

While recent research suggests that AI startups employ novel or different business models, one could argue that AI technology has been used in business models for a long time already—questioning the novelty of those business models. Therefore, this study investigates how AI startup business models potentially differ from common IT-related business models. First, a business model taxonomy of AI startups is developed from a sample of 100 AI startups and four archetypal business model patterns are derived: AI-charged Product/Service Provider, AI Development Facilitator, Data Analytics Provider, and Deep Tech Researcher. Second, drawing on this descriptive analysis, three distinctive aspects of AI startup business models are discussed: (1) new value propositions through AI capabilities, (2) different roles of data for value creation, and (3) the impact of AI technology on the overall business logic. This study contributes to our fundamental understanding of AI startup business models by identifying their key characteristics, common instantiations, and distinctive aspects. Furthermore, this study proposes promising directions for future entrepreneurship research.

To understand the underlying causes of this phenomenon, we conduct an explanatory case study consisting of and interview study and a survey on the challenges of realizing and utilizing artificial intelligence in the context of software-intensive businesses. As a result, we identify a vicious circle that prevents practitioners from moving from prototypical AI-based analytics to continuous and productively usable software analytics and business intelligence solutions. In order to break the vicious circle in a targeted manner, we identify a set of solutions based on existing literature as well as the previously conducted interviews and survey.

We employ a qualitative approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with 19 entrepreneurial firms operating in the artificial intelligence field in China, and identify two types of psychological tensions at the conceptualization stage (fear of losing the B2B relationship and divergent expectations) and one type of psychological tension at the commercialization stage (attention embeddedness).

This is due to the fact that a roadmap itself reflects only a snapshot of an organization's strategic plan based on the information at the point when a roadmap is developed. It is crucial for an organization to monitor changes in its business environment which may exert different effects on a roadmap and assess whether such changes are sufficiently relevant and significant. If so, then an updated version of a roadmap will be required. According to current practice, the roadmap meeting is scheduled periodically to review and keep the roadmap it up-to-date. However, this approach may not be sufficiently proactive in monitoring the status of a roadmap and allowing the management to make a timely decision on its revision. This article explores the conceptual approach called data-driven roadmapping using a data-driven computerized decision support system that can be semiautomated to reflect any changes in the business environment, providing recommendations as to whether a roadmap needs to be slightly adjusted, totally revised, or remain unchanged. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Data science; data-driven roadmapping (DDRM); decision science; roadmapping monitoring; technology roadmapping; TRM; TRM implementation; TRM status signal","Artificial intelligence; Data driven; Data-driven roadmapping; Decision science; Roadmapping; Roadmapping monitoring; Status signal; Technology roadmapping; TRM; TRM implementation; TRM status signal; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118404823

However, scheduling workflow under resource allocation is significantly challenging due to the computational intensity of the workflow, the dependency between tasks, and the heterogeneity of cloud resources. During resource allocation, the cloud computing environment may encounter considerable problems in terms of execution time and execution cost, which may lead to disruptions in service quality given to users. Therefore, there is a necessity to reduce the makespan and the cost at the same time. Often, this is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. In this respect, the fundamental research issue we address in this paper is the potential trade-off between the makespan and the cost of virtual machine usage. We propose a HEFT-ACO approach, which is based on the heterogeneous earliest end time (HEFT), and the ant colony algorithm (ACO) to minimize them. Experimental simulations are performed on three types of real-world science workflows and take into account the properties of the Amazon EC2 cloud platform.

Only China is taking advantage of an own digital currency and has prohibited any other digital currency out of its control. The topic is also relevant to geopolitical balances and it triggers more international conflicts. The attempt to include cryptocurrency and cryptoassets into the scope of the existing legislation does not lead to a solution. The suggested solution is twofold: we must reiterate the legal nature of sovereign money and the lack of any protection for crypto-users. Legitimacy by public authorities, which is currently granted, either implicitly or explicitly, should be avoided. Crypto-assets (or STO-Security Tokens) are free to operate, but the decentralized ledgers they use must make information accessible to regulatory and supervisory Authorities, and States must guarantee cybersecurity of digital processes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain/DLT; Conversion platforms; Cryptocurrency market; Money and financial stability","artificial intelligence; central bank; currency; financial system; reform process; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114873498

Novel DL-based image reconstruction algorithms correcting aliasing artifacts, signal loss, and noise amplification with previously unobtainable effectiveness are prime examples of how DL algorithms deliver promised value propositions in musculoskeletal radiology. The speed of DL-based tissue segmentation promises great efficiency gains that may permit the inclusion of tissue compositional-based information routinely into radiology reports. Similarly, DL algorithms give rise to a myriad of opportunities for workflow improvements, including intelligent and adaptive hanging protocols, speech recognition, report generation, scheduling, precertification, and billing. The value propositions of disease-detecting DL algorithms include reduced error rates and increased productivity. However, more studies using authentic clinical workflow settings are necessary to fully understand the value of DL algorithms for disease detection in clinical practice. Successful workflow integration and management of multiple algorithms are critical for translating the value propositions of DL algorithms into clinical practice but represent a major roadblock for which solutions are critically needed. While there is no consensus about the most sustainable business model, radiology departments will need to carefully weigh the benefits and disadvantages of each commercially available DL algorithm. Although more studies are needed to understand the value and impact of DL algorithms on clinical practice, DL technology will likely play an important role in the future of musculoskeletal imaging. © 2021, ISS.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Musculoskeletal; Radiology","artificial intelligence; bone atrophy; bone density; bone malformation; bone mass; clinical practice; computer assisted tomography; deep learning; fracture; health care cost; human; image reconstruction; image segmentation; imaging algorithm; musculoskeletal system examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; Review; soft tissue injury; workflow; algorithm; artificial intelligence; diagnostic imaging; image processing; musculoskeletal system; radiology; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Musculoskeletal System; Radiology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105870196

In this current worldwide emergency, the clinical business is searching for new advancements to screen and combat COVID-19 contamination. Strategies used by artificial intelligence can stretch screen the spread of the infection, distinguish highly infected patients, and be compelling in supervising the illness continuously. The artificial intelligence anticipation can further be used for passing dangers by sufficiently dissecting information from past sufferers. International patient support with recommendations for population testing, medical care, notification, and infection control can help fight this deadly virus. We proposed the hybrid deep learning method to diagnose COVID-19. The layered approach is used here to measure the symptom level of the patients and to analyze the patient image data whether he/she is positive with COVID-19. This work utilizes smart AI techniques to predict and diagnose the coronavirus rapidly by the Oura smart ring within 24 h. In the laboratory, a coronavirus rapid test is prepared with the help of a deep learning model using the RNN and CNN algorithms to diagnose the coronavirus rapidly and accurately. The result shows the value 0 or 1. The result 1 indicates the person is affected with coronavirus and the result 0 indicates the person is not affected with coronavirus. X-Ray and CT image classifications are considered here so that the threshold value is utilized for identifying an individual’s health condition from the initial stage to a severe stage. Threshold value 0.5 is used to identify coronavirus initial stage condition and 1 is used to identify the coronavirus severe condition of the patient.

Based on it, the ASINA project expands a data-driven Management Methodology (ASINA-SMM) capturing quality, safety, and sustainability criteria across the Nano-Enabled Products’ (NEPs) life cycle. We base the development of this methodology through value chains of highly representative classes of NEPs in the market, namely, (i) self-cleaning/air-purifying/antimicrobial coatings and (ii) nano-structured capsules delivering active phases in cosmetics. These NEPs improve environmental quality and human health/wellness and have innovative competence to industrial sectors such as healthcare, textiles, cosmetics, and medical devices. The purpose of this article is to visually exhibit and explain the ASINA approach, which allows identifying, combining, and addressing the following pillars: environmental impact, techno-economic performance, functionality, and human and environmental safety when developing novel NEPs, at an early stage. A metamodel supports the above by utilizing quality data collected throughout the NEPs’ life cycle, for maximization of functionality (to meet stakeholders needs) and nano-safety (regulatory obligations) and for the minimization of costs (to meet business requirements) and environmental impacts (to achieve sustainability). Furthermore, ASINA explores digitalization opportunities (digital twins) to speed the nano-industry translation into automatic progress towards economic, social, environmental, and governance sustainability.

Combining literature research and discussion from the forum sponsored by the academic divisions of Chinese Academy of Sciences on Frontiers in Science and Technology with the theme of ""scientific publishing in the new era"", this paper analyzes the current situation of China's scientific journal publishing and the opportunities and challenges it faces, and puts forward suggestions and solutions for scientific journal development in China. Based on the analysis of the current situation and development trend of international scientific publishing, this paper reviews the scientific journal publishing in the open science environment from aspects of open access publishing of journals and papers, open peer review, open data, preprint platforms, and journal business models. It also discusses how new technologies promote the innovation and development of scientific publishing from aspects of digital publishing and communication, big data, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and interaction and integration based on various new technologies and media. In addition, this paper also briefly introduces the prediction by the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers for the development trend of academic publishing industry in the next 3-5 years with the themes of ""trust & integrity"", ""entering the AI era-creative humans & smart machines"", ""diversity in a multi-user environment"", ""focus on the user-connect the dots"", and ""let's go upstream-seeking the source of trust and truth"" from 2017 to 2021. This paper holds that compared with world-class scientific journals, China's scientific journals lag behind in the ability to attract high-level research results, prevention and treatment of academic misconduct, brand reputation, and international influence. To rank among the world's first-class scientific journals, China's scientific journals must be in line with international standards in dealing with scientific research integrity, comply with the norms of international journals on academic integrity and publishing ethics, and improve their ability to deal with academic misconduct. Journal publishers should cooperate with the management department and the academic community to form an organic whole and jointly build a healthy academic ecosystem. With the rapid development of scientific research in China and a friendly publishing environment supported by policies to promote world-class journals, China's scientific journals are facing unprecedented development opportunities. This paper puts forward suggestions and solutions for the development of China's scientific journals in the new era as follows: (1) Pay attention to the development trend of open science and integrate into the development environment of open science; (2) strengthen international cooperation and seek continuous development in the cooperation; (3) innovate the concept of scientific publishing service and expand new publishing technologies and methods; (4) perfect the standards for publishing ethics and enhance the ability to deal with academic misconduct; (5) build high-level talent teams for scientific publishing and improve the scientific literacy of science communicators; (6) seek win-win social and market benefits and explore the sustainable model for scientific journal publishing in China. © 2022, Science Press.

Initially developed machine learning techniques were more suited to the requirements in those times and may need changes to make them more suitable to the present needs. Initial developments of machine learning algorithms focused on brief training and testing datasets to prove their worthiness. Large datasets with a sufficient number of features together with tools and techniques to effectively perform data analysis and prediction in real-time are a more adapted platform. The demand-driven societal requirements of targeted information extraction can easily be met using some data mining analysis techniques. The main aim is to bring artificial intelligence into the business domain. High-level software frameworks help mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists to reap the benefits of Big Data mining techniques by collaborating with academic researchers and professional data scientists. The rate of data creation is approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day [1]. Those data are heterogeneous, voluminous, complex, and generated from different autonomous sources with distributed and decentralized control.

Empirical results are synthesized to highlight their relevance from a technology and project management standpoint, identifying several lessons learned that can be used for planning highly integrated and automated smart grid projects. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review leads to selecting 108 research articles dealing with smart grids and AIA applications. Keywords are based on the following research questions: What is the growth trend in Smart Grid projects using intelligent systems and data analytics? What business value is offered when AI-based methods are applied? How do applications of intelligent systems combine with data analytics? What lessons can be learned for Smart Grid and AIA projects? Findings: The 108 selected articles are classified according to the following four research issues in smart grids project management: AIA integrated applications; AI-focused technologies; analytics-focused technologies; architecture and design methods. A broad set of smart grid functionality is reviewed, seeking to find commonality among several applications, including as follows: dynamic energy management; automation of extract, transform and load for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems data; multi-level representations of data; the relationship between the standard three-phase transforms and modern data analytics; real-time or short-time voltage stability assessment; smart city architecture; home energy management system; building energy consumption; automated fault and disturbance analysis; and power quality control. Originality/value: Given the diversity of issues reviewed, a more capability-focused research agenda is needed to further synthesize empirical findings for AI-based smart grids. Research may converge toward more focus on business rules systems, that may best support smart grid design, proof development, governance and effectiveness. These AIA technologies must be further integrated with smart grid project management methodologies and enable a greater diversity of renewable and non-renewable production sources. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Data analytics; Energy sector; Project management; Smart grid; Surveys","Advanced Analytics; Automation; Data Analytics; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Information management; Intelligent systems; Project management; Quality control; Real time systems; SCADA systems; Solar buildings; System stability; Building energy consumption; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic energy managements; Extract , transform and loads; Home energy management systems; Supervisory control and dataacquisition systems (SCADA); Systematic literature review; Voltage stability assessment; Smart power grids",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112559126

In this paper, we design an AIoT system for the smart agriculture based on the concept of front-rear end separation and the framework of MVVM (Model-View-View Model), through which it is possible to handle complex business logic and makes the integrating the AI algorithms much easier. Specifically, the system consists of a remote data service platform, the data collection terminals build on Raspberry Pi and the wireless data transmission using narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) modules. The data service platform is designed with the separated front-end and rear-end. The front-end is a web page constructed by the Vue.js and Element, while the rear-end business logic processing is constructed using the Python Django framework. The data interaction between the front and rear ends is realized through Axios. In such a way, the data in the front-end and the rear-end are decoupled, which makes it possible to improve the capability in dealing with complex data and makes it easy to carry out add-on development and extend new functions. Based on the data service platform, a series of basic application functions are integrated, including real-time data monitoring, historical data query, data visualization and abnormal data alerting, etc. Moreover, we integrate a deep-learning-based plant disease and pest detection algorithm in the propose system to show its scalability. In addition, the system also combines edge computing technology to improve the overall response efficiency of the system.

While being effective to a large extent, the system generates very high false positives. With evolving patterns of financial transactions, it also needs effective mechanism for scenario fine-tuning. The purpose of this paper is to highlight quantitative method for optimizing scenarios in money laundering context. While anomaly detection and unsupervised learning can identify huge patterns of false negatives, that can reveal new patterns, for existing scenarios, business generally rely on judgment/data analysis-based threshold finetuning of existing scenario. The objective of such exercises is productivity rate enhancement. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose an approach called linear/non-linear optimization on threshold finetuning. This traditional operations research technique has been often used for many optimization problems. Current problem of threshold finetuning for scenario has two key features that warrant linear optimization. First, scenario-based suspicious transaction reporting (STR) cases and overall customer level catch rate has a very high overlap, i.e. more than one scenario captures same customer with different degree of abnormal behavior. This implies that scenarios can be better coordinated to catch more non-overlapping customers. Second, different customer segments have differing degree of transaction behavior; hence, segmenting and then reducing slack (redundant catch of suspect) can result in better productivity rate (defined as productive alerts divided by total alerts) in a money laundering context. Findings: Theresults show that by implementing the optimization technique, the productivity rate can be improved. This is done through two drivers. First, the team gets to know the best possible combination of threshold across scenarios for maximizing the STR observations better coverage of STR – fine-tuned thresholds are able to better cover the suspected transactions as compared to traditional approaches. Second, there is reduction of redundancy/slack margins on thresholds, thereby improving the overall productivity rate. The experiments focused on six scenario combinations, resulted in reduction of 5.4% of alerts and 1.6% of unique customers for same number of STR capture. Originality/value: The authors propose an approach called linear/non-linear optimization on threshold finetuning, as very little work is done on optimizing scenarios itself, which is the most widely used practice to monitor enterprise-wide anti-money laundering solutions. This proves that by adding a layer of mathematical optimization, financial institutions can additionally save few million dollars, without compromising on their STR capture capability. This hopefully will go a long way in leveraging artificial intelligence for further making financial institutions more efficient in controlling financial crimes and save some hard-earned dollars. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anomaly detection; Anti-money laundering; Artificial intelligence; Optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102198530

In this study, we redefine ""framework for identifying researchers’ areas of expertise"" as ""a framework for quantifying intra-individual diversity among researchers. Note that diversity here refers to authorship of articles in multiple research fields. The application of this framework then made it possible to visualize organizational diversity by accumulating the intra-individual diversity of researchers and to discuss the innovation strategy of the organization. The analysis in this study discusses how countries are promoting research on the topics of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which are at the core of Industry 4.0, from an innovation perspective. Note that Industry 4.0 is a technological framework that aims to “improve the efficiency of all social systems,” “create new industries,” and “increase intellectual productivity.” For the analysis, we used 19-year bibliographic data (2000–2018) from the top 20 countries in terms of the number of papers in AI, big data, and IoT technologies. As the results, this study classified the styles of cross-disciplinary fusion into four patterns in AI and three patterns in big data. This study did not consider the results in IoT because of only small differences between countries. Furthermore, regional differences in the style of cross-disciplinary fusion were also observed, and the global innovation patterns in Industry 4.0 were classified into seven categories. In Europe and North America, the cross-disciplinary integration style was similar to that between the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, England, Italy, Canada, and France. In Asia, the cross-disciplinary fusion style was similar between China, Japan, and South Korea. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

The study used the author’s methodological approach developed earlier to assess the social responsibility of business based on the analysis of corporate reporting; methods of substantive and logical analysis of research results in the field of SDGs, human capital, and social responsibility of economic entities; methods of abduction and search for explanatory hypotheses; logical and content analysis of financial and non-financial reporting standards; comparative analysis of corporate reporting of Russian companies in the area of material production, retail, and finance. The study found that Russia’s leading businesses disclose extensive information about human capital, innovation activities, and SDGs in their corporate reports. However, the relationship between the achievements in all three areas is not clearly visible in many cases. The study revealed a lack of a clear link between specific activities on the development of human capital, innovations, and certain SDGs at the levels of strategy, business models, plans, programs, and their practical implementation. As a result of the research, the authors made several proposals to improve the quality and usefulness of corporate reporting and propose a new approach, which consists in structuring non-financial information on the SDGs, either as the main version of reporting or as a separate section, reflecting the impact of human capital, innovation, the company’s strategy, business models, and certain types of capital on the SDGs. Implementing the recommendations in a digitalized environment would be an important step toward the user expectation of personalized reporting and would stimulate research on the development of artificial intelligence and the digital capabilities of employees. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Human capital; Innovation; Sustainable development goals",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140239187

The need to address the specific requirements of the customer groups has become the guiding principle behind the business strategies adopted by companies. These customer needs and, subsequently, the provision of the appropriate products and services to the customer, are dependent on where they live, their personal characteristics (e.g., age, education, income, households etc.). Geodemographic systems take advantage of information technology to analyze these types of data for a better understanding of the consumer characteristics and improved performing of marketing strategies. In the present study, a geodemographic system is implemented utilizing geographic information systems (GIS) technology and artificial intelligence (AI). GIS technology offers a powerful set of tools for the input, management, and visualization of data, while AI provides advanced analytical tools such as the unsupervised fuzzy classification through the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied to the Attica region in Greece. It uses the official socioeconomic data of the Hellenic Statistical Authority.

Big industries started adopting AI for their HR and workforce management (WFM) activities, however, past literature suggests a lack of AI adoption in MSMEs. In the ongoing pandemic, a large number of job loss is reported in the literature. Thus, artificial intelligence-powered intelligent workforce management (WFM) may be critical during or post-pandemic to manage the huge employment in MSMEs. In this study, we develop and test a conceptual framework based on three areas where AI-powered WFM adoption for MSMEs revenue development has been highlighted. These are (a) risk management (workforce), (b) business and marketing, and (c) information exchange. Six hypotheses have been proposed and tested using structural equation modelling (SEM) with responses from 307 employees. According to the research findings, all of the offered hypotheses are significant. The findings suggest to MSME decision-makers that AI-powered WFM may help revenue growth, workforce risk reduction, intelligent business and marketing, and thoughtful, innovative, and safe information exchange. MSMEs are required to use AI in the information sharing that help in workforce risk management, business and marketing, and intelligent workforce management that scale-up the economic growth. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence; business intelligence; intelligent information sharing; micro small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs); risk intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Decision making; Employment; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Marketing; Social networking (online); Business-intelligence; Information sharing; Intelligent information; Intelligent information sharing; Micro small and medium scale enterprise; Revenue growth; Risk intelligence; Risks management; Small and medium scale enterprise; Workforce management; Risk management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139944118

It is especially vital to avoid unforeseen breakdowns, which may result in costly charges and production losses if they do not occur in advance. While the execution of an acceptable management plan affects maintenance productivity, it also affects the adoption of proper procedures and tools to help in the assessment processes in this field. This difficulty, among other things, affects a company's capacity to achieve high performance with the equipment it employs, as well as the judgement process and the design of the firm's maintenance plan. In order to achieve this goal, the aim of this paper is to exemplify how intelligent systems can be used to enhance judgement techniques in the implementation of the lean maintenance perspective, allowing for an advancement in the functional capabilities of the industry's technological infrastructure. The reseachers employed artificial intelligence technologies to look for connections between specific operations carried out as part of the deployment of lean maintenance and the findings achieved. The raw set notion, which was used in this situation, was used to determine whether or not the lean maintenance method was being used in this study. The crisis management process carries with it some of the most complex data technology concerns ever encountered. It necessitates, among other items, active information gathering and information transfer efforts, that are used for a range of functions, such as decreasing uncertainty, attempting to measure and manage consequences, and attempting to manage resources in a way that goes beyond what is generally possible to deal with daily problems. It also needs the employment of artificial intelligence technology, among other things, to increase crisis awareness. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Artificial intelligence; Business; Crisis management; Framework performance; Lean management; Monitoring robotics; Optimizations; Production maintenance techniques","Information management; Intelligent systems; Lean production; Productivity; Robotics; Artificial intelligence technologies; Crisis management; Framework performance; Lean maintenance; Lean management; Monitoring robotic; Optimisations; Performance; Production maintenance technique; Structural equation models; Maintenance",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139928985

The availability of knowledge and privileges to insiders makes it extremely difficult to prevent, detect or deter malicious insider activities. In the literature, several studies have proposed deception-based approaches to mitigate insider threats through different layers of corporate systems. However, the integration of access control and cyber deception methods has not been adequately discussed. In this paper, we integrate Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) with honey-based deception techniques to effectively track insiders, particularly in the context of a dynamic work environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to design, implement and evaluate this integration. Our evaluation results show that the proposed framework reliably identifies sensitive attributes in the system and generates indistinguishable honey values to protect them with an average similarity score of 0.90 to the truth.

Customer churn forecast is a difficult problem in many corporate sectors, particularly the telecommunications industry. Because customer churns have a direct impact on a company's total revenue, telecommunications firms have begun to develop 76 models to reduce churns at an earlier stage. Previous research has revealed that AI and ML models are effective CCP solutions. According to this viewpoint, this study proposes a unique AI-based CCP model for Telecommunication Business Markets (AICCP-TBM). The AICCP-TBM model's purpose is to control the existence of churners and non-churners in the telecom sector. The proposed AICCP-TBM model employs a Chaotic Salp Swarm Optimization-based Feature Selection (CSSO-FS) method for the best feature assortment. In addition, a Fuzzy Rule-based Classifier(FRC) is used to distinguish between client churners and non-churners. A technique known as Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) is used to pick the membership functions for the FRC model in order to improve the classification performance of the FRC model. The performance of the AICCP-TBM model is validated using a benchmark CCP dataset and the experimental results are reviewed from several angles. In relations of presentation, the imitation consequences demonstrated that the AICCP-TBM model surpassed the most recent state-of-the-art CPP models. The suggested AICCP-TBM method's comparative accuracy was thoroughly tested on the three datasets used. Using datasets 1-3, this technique obtained better levels of accuracy, with the maximum attainable values being 97.25 %, 97.5 % and 94.33 %.

Accordingly, the irregular fluctuation of business data poses a critical challenge to traditional approaches. Therefore, to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an effective model is required to proactively predict an enterprise’s performance and simultaneously generate scientific performance optimization solutions. Consequently, at the intersection of artificial intelligence algorithms, operations research, and management science, an intelligent DEA-SVM model, which has a theoretical contribution, is developed in this study. The capabilities of this model are verified through sufficient numerical experiments. On the one hand, this model outperforms traditional algorithms in prediction accuracy. On the other hand, effective performance optimization solutions for low-performance enterprises are obtained from the input–output perspective. Moreover, the application value of this model is reflected in its successful implementation in the healthcare industry. Thus, it is a user-friendly tool for realizing the stable operation of enterprises in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Healthcare management; Performance optimization; Performance prediction; SVM algorithm","Data envelopment analysis; Forecasting; Health care; Coronaviruses; External environments; Health-care managements; Irregular fluctuations; Optimization solution; Performance; Performance optimizations; Performance prediction; SVM algorithm; SVM model; COVID-19",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139720294

The asset targeted to integrate the well performance and the available capacity of the existing processing facilities, and with that allocate resources to actionable optimization opportunities. The optimization is driven by allocating the facilities volume (in oil) to those wells with higher oil output. The methodology uses the classic well by well production optimization approach (find the highest incremental oil with the lowest investment), the novelty is to rank the wells based on the main bottlenecks of the processing facilities. In this way the ranking of the wells is dictated by the overall production system analysis from the pore to the export pipeline. Once a constraint is identified a baseline is set and a target status is defined. The gap between current and target states is overcame by robust data structure that enables business and artificial intelligence workflows for well and facility smart analytics. The enhanced workflow allows surface facilities surveillance in a relative high frequency, this in combination with the well monitoring improve optimization decision dramatically. As a result, this strategy has allowed the asset to reduce 900 man-hours a year, reduce operative production losses by 40%, lessen artificial lift failure events rate by 40%, increase production in the order of 5% (in a 9K BOPD asset), bringing the project to outstanding production levels. Furthermore, this solution has indirectly helped to reduce CO2 emissions in at least 20 Tons per year, reducing the carbon footprint in a sensitive environmental area in the amazon forest.

Accordingly, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) concerning economic growth and carbon emission need comprehensive insight into the logistic industry - an area mainly analyzed from a general perspective by existing literature. Against this backdrop, this paper analyzes the short-run and long-run effects of dynamic variables and their interaction on investment in the logistics industry in connection with economic prosperity, Information and communication technology (ICT), trade, and carbon emission. Accordingly, the autoregressive distributive lag model (ARDL) is applied to observe a close regional perspective of a developing economy like Pakistan using time-series data from 1990 to 2019. The study findings observe a unidirectional long-run causality running from economic prosperity, logistics industry, Information and communication technology (ICT), and trade development to carbon emission. Moreover, regional economic growth exerts a significant demand-pull effect on corresponding regional economic development. These findings imply that high-income geographical regions will continue to face the higher long-run futuristic risks of the contemporary investment in logistic industry development when adhering to ever-evolving carbon emission standards under regional preferences. Accordingly, these regions should be given urgent attention concerning high-technology and artificial intelligence applications in developing economies. Given the availability of technological and general resource efficiencies in developing economies, such applied business-oriented scope of this statistical analysis might facilitate geo-specific strategies concerning future outcomes of current investment in the traditional logistic industry in those countries. We believe the overall analysis can be applied to other developing economies to facilitate sustainable development goals. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Carbon Emission; ICT; Modern Logistic Industry; Sustainable Development","Artificial intelligence; Carbon; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Geographical regions; Planning; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Auto-regressive; Carbon emissions; Developing economies; Information and Communication Technologies; Lag model; Logistics industry; Longest run; Modern logistic industry; Modern logistics; Pakistan; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139597769

The values of unintentional risk are becoming substantial areas of debate to make judgments connected to essential infrastructure safety. However, it is very difficult to secure the data because many risk factors are involved in it, and the main challenge is the reliability of risk data. Technological developments revolution the way we live with the variations made nationwide and globally. These technological advancements also have unintended consequences in the form of security risks. Emerging cloud computing, artificial neural networks, and machine learning have empowered system engineers to construct a machine that can replicate human intelligence. Due to the growing demand for data processing for decision making, its implementation has been included in the company management. Artificial intelligence is a technological advancement involving computer systems to do tasks that generally need human intelligence. AI is playing an indispensable role in the industry revolution 4.0. AI is used to develop the most effective solutions to these cyber threats and provide the paramount solution.

Yet, much of this literature is normative and conceptual in nature. How organizational members perceive AI and the job role changes that come with it is, so far, largely unknown territory for both HR scholars and practitioners. We sought to investigate the relationship between humans and AI and conducted an in-depth exploratory study into the co-existence of humans and two early-stage AI-solutions, one for “low-status” automation and another for “high-status”; augmentation. We suggest that different organizational groups may engage in distinctly different sensemaking processes regarding AI, an important insight for successful HRM strategies when AI is being introduced into the workplace. Moreover, contrary to recent conceptual work, our findings indicate that AI-enabled automation and augmentation solutions may not be detached from nor exist in tension with each other. They are deeply embedded in organizational processes and workflows for which people who co-exist with the technologies must take ownership. Our findings, in part, go against discussions on AI “taking over” jobs or deskilling humans. We describe a more nuanced version of reality fluctuating around the various ways different organizational groups encounter different AI-solutions in their daily work. Finally, our study warns against unconditional technological enthusiasm, managerial ignorance of the nature of work that employees undertake in different organizational groups, and a neglect of the time and effort required to successfully implement AI-solutions that affect not only the home organization but also members of the broader ecosystem. © 2022 The Authors.

Most applications of AI focus on the development of connected and autonomous cars, rather than the optimisation of automotive operations and manufacturing processes. This work, therefore, bridged this gap and shed light on the topic of AI in the context of automotive manufacturing and Industry 4.0. It aimed to promote understanding and provide up-to-date insights on specific models and methods of AI, applications that have been achieved with best practices as well as the problems that were encountered, underpinned with possible future prospects. A systematic literature review approach was adopted to ensure broad and thorough coverage of current knowledge and the identification of relevant literature on the topic. The literature search was confined to papers that were published from 2015 onwards using the databases of IEEE and ScienceDirect as primary sources, with a three-keyword search phrase to narrow down the results and increase specificity. A total of 359 papers were identified and subsequently screened for eligibility, of which 84 papers were selected for quantitative and 79 papers for qualitative analysis. The results of the quantitative analysis confirmed that the topic has markedly increased in significance, with a mere 3 papers published in 2015 and 33 papers in 2021. The majority of papers dealt with solving problems in production (39.29%), quality (35.71%) and assembly (16.67%), whereas supply chain (5.95%) and business intelligence (2.38%) were inadequately represented. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed that machine learning methods dominate current research and automotive applications, with neural networks as the most used out of more than 70 identified models. The industrial applicability was confirmed by many use cases including quality inspection, robot assembly, human–robot collaboration, material demand prediction or AI-enabled manufacturing decision making. The problems of such applications were mainly attributed to data availability and quality, model development and gaps in simulation, system integration, the complexity of automotive processes, the physical conditions of the system environment and dynamic change. For industrial applications it is thus recommended to further optimise AI methods and models, enabling a wider system integration by harvesting the potential of big data and both edge and cloud computing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AI models and methods; Artificial intelligence; Automotive manufacturing; Systematic literature review",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139436067

However, online shopping has inherent information asymmetry due to the anonymity and liquidity of C2C (Customer to Customer) transactions. In the virtual environment, buyers cannot see the physical products, and they do not experience online shopping in person. They can only select products through the seller's pictures and descriptions. After payment, there may be some problems, such as sending the wrong product, the seller does not deliver the goods after receiving the goods, or the seller does not receive the payment after delivery, etc. Therefore, the credit problem is the bottleneck for the development of online shopping business. Therefore, in order to ensure the transaction security of buyers and sellers, major C2C online trading platforms at home and abroad have established a credit evaluation mechanism. However, due to the reliability of e-commerce technology, the legal environment of e-commerce, the ethical environment of e-commerce, and the problems of existing credit evaluation indicators. The development of e-commerce in China is very slow. Therefore, actively exploring the credit model of Chinese e-commerce is of great significance to promoting the development of Chinese market economy. In this paper, AI technology analyzes the credit evaluation management method of C2C e-commerce website for transaction participants. This paper summarizes some key factors that affect the establishment of C2C credit, and further finds that there are some problems in the credit evaluation model involved in the e-commerce process. These problems stem from the inability to properly deal with the current development of e-commerce in China. There are problems with its evaluation system and honest transaction process. In order to better promote the development of e-commerce, in view of the above problems, this paper proposes a new model of C2C e-commerce credit system based on the game theory model of e-commerce buyers and sellers of AI technology, and further improves the evaluation model and related measures to completely solve the problem. Credit value generally shows a growth trend, but the trend is not obvious. © 2022 Wei Mu and HePing Ding.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer networks; Game theory; Sales; Software agents; Virtual reality; AI Technologies; Artificial intelligence technologies; Buyers and sellers; Computer technology; Credit evaluation model; Credit evaluations; E- commerces; Model-based OPC; Network computers; Online shopping; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139435389

It has evolved over the last years and has started attracting many people in research and businesses in the industry. It supports the development of machine learning (ML) pipelines typical in the phases of data collection, data pre-processing, building datasets, model training, hyper-parameters refinement, testing, and deployment to production. This complex pipeline workflow is a tedious process of iterative experimentation. Moreover, cloud computing services provide advanced features for managing ML stages and deploying them efficiently to production. Specifically, serverless computing has been applied in different stages of the machine learning pipeline. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is missing to know the serverless suitability and benefits it can provide to the ML pipeline. In this paper, we provide a systematic mapping study of machine learning systems applied on serverless architecture that include 53 relevant studies. During this study, we focused on (1) exploring the evolution trend and the main venues; (2) determining the researchers' focus and interest in using serverless on machine learning; (3) discussing solutions that serverless computing provides to machine learning. Our results show that serverless usage is growing, and several venues are interested in the topic. In addition, we found that the most widely used serverless provider is AWS Lambda, where the primary application was used in the deployment of the ML model. Additionally, several challenges were explored, such as reducing cost, resource scalability, and reducing latency. We also discuss the potential challenges of adopting ML on serverless, such as respecting service level agreement, the cold start problem, security, and privacy. Finally, our contribution provides foundations for future research and applications that involve machine learning in serverless computing. © 2013 IEEE.","FaaS; function as a service; machine learning; Serverless; SLR; SM; systematic literature review; systematic mapping","Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data structures; Learning systems; Mapping; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Cloud-computing; Computational modelling; Faas; Function as a service; Machine-learning; Serverless; Serverless computing; SLR; SM; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Cloud computing",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139427770

This Ecosystem consists of four major hubs: A) Instructional design and performance technology hub, B) Knowledge hub, C) Research and technology hub, and D) Talent and training hub. Common to all four hubs are the factors in the three wheels (Fig. 8): a) Infrastructure, business industry, and communication: b) technology access and equity, and c) user rights, data security, and privacy policy.

These business models use GPS and Web Services endlessly. In the current scenario, in many of the prominent delivery systems, many employees who are specifically intended for the delivery of the products of their organizations, that the client has ordered for, are employed for the whole duration of the day, even when there are less requests for the delivery of the product, leading to the wastage of man power as well as the time. This is mainly due to lack of proper analysis of the real time data. This paper proposes a model that works in a real-time environment and can be used to generate some real time co-ordinates of delivery persons, which can be used for developing a Machine Learning Model.

In the contemporary era of digitalization and seamless integration of businesses using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), DDoS attacks are increasing significantly leading to higher risk of critical digital infrastructure. Such cyber-attacks are alarming as they threaten national cyber safety and security. Many solutions came into existence based on entropy, traffic correlations and so on. However, with innovations in machine learning as part of Artificial Intelligence (AI), usage of AI can lead to faster detection of DDoS attacks. This is the motivation behind the research carried out and presented in this paper. A feature selection algorithm is proposed to boost performance of classifiers such as SVM, Logistic Regression (LG), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). These classifiers along with the proposed feature selection algorithm are used to form a framework for detecting DDoS attacks efficiently. The proposed feature selection algorithm reduces space and time complexity besides improving accuracy of the detectors. We have built a prototype application using Python data science platform to demonstrate proof of the concept. The empirical results revealed that the proposed feature selection algorithm has significantly improved detection performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Data science; DDoS attack detection; Index terms—DDoS attack; Machine learning","Chemical detection; Cybersecurity; Decision trees; Feature Selection; Information services; Network security; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Attack detection; Denialof- service attacks; Distributed denial of service; Distributed denial of service attack detection; Feature selection algorithm; Index terms; Index term—distributed denial of service attack; Machine-learning; Denial-of-service attack",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139410880

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges. For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand ethical challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen Böhm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business is nature, and nature is business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human–nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business–nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their “business and society” assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40 years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth) v. Royal Dutch Shell illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of “consumer society”, a challenge to the dominant “growth logic” and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation. In the words of our commentators, grand challenges must be addressed urgently, and the Journal of Business Ethics should be at the forefront of tackling them. © 2022, The Author(s).","Capability approach; Climate change; Consumer ethics; Cultural differences; Feminism; Grand challenges; Inequality",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139392430

This encompasses all digitalisation and automation processes in business and our daily lives, including Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robots, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented reality. These technological advancements are having a profound impact on our lives. From a technical standpoint, it brings us to precision agriculture. This provides a data-driven strategy for efficiently growing and maintaining crops on cultivable land, enabling farmers to use most of the resources at their disposal. Throughout the supply chain, daily operations create massive volumes of data. Most of this information was previously untouched, but with the help of big data technologies, such information can be used to improve the performance and production of any crop. Depending on the crop type and its growth needs, digitised harvesters can help handle huge areas in various situations, particularly agriculture. This paper is brief about Agriculture 4.0 and its condition. Smart farming, Various key technologies and specific domains for the Exploring Agriculture 4.0 Domain are discussed in detail and, finally, identified and discussed significant applications of Agriculture 4.0 technologies. These technologies are essential to our lives since they simplify our daily duties without recognising them. In Agriculture 4.0 systems, fleets of digitised equipment employ current infrastructures like cloud computing to connect, identify the processing condition of different regions and the requirement for input materials and coordinate the machinery. © 2022 The Authors","Agriculture 4.0; Applications; Farm; Food; Smart farming; Technologies",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139349533

In recent years, chemicals have been widely used and demand is increasing. However, the physical properties of some chemical substances are very unstable and vary according to process conditions, making it difficult to control. At the same time, safety issues have become a major ""red warning""for industrial enterprises. Various safety incidents have attracted social attention, and the chemical industry has also learned from them, sounding the safety alarm for itself and reviewing its own shortcomings, and taking improvement measures. Therefore, it is obviously necessary to always emphasize the concept of ""safety first, prevention first, and comprehensive management""to prevent enterprise safety accidents. It is necessary to regularly investigate and analyze the situation of safety accidents to summarize and continuously improve. This is the most important thing for enterprises to prevent the continuous occurrence of safety accidents in a good and effective way. Regularly analyzing, summarizing, and improving safety issues are the best way to prevent accidents. Deep learning mainly relies on letting computers or other electronic devices perform iterative learning on a large number of data samples according to the rules defined by the program. The computer after learning will have the analysis ability similar to humans, but its analysis ability is limited to the range of the sample data to be learned. Artificial intelligence technology realizes an operation system that simulates human thinking through the definition of algorithms and programs. The use of deep learning and artificial intelligence in industrial enterprise safety production supervision can realize enterprise safety production supervision, early warning, and intelligent operation. Without the security of the production chain, a business cannot develop. Based on the basic theory of safety supervision and early warning in the field of enterprise safety production and related knowledge of artificial intelligence, this paper studies the work safety in the supervision and early warning mechanism abides by the selection principle of the management system, safety production indicators and indicator system, and conducts work based on the production work data of industrial plants. Reasonable safety supervision and early warning mechanism provide technical assistance for effectively controlling safety accidents in production and management measures to improve enterprise safety. © 2022 Yu Wang.",,"Accident prevention; Deep learning; Industrial economics; Industrial plants; Information management; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Machinery; Quality management; Comprehensive strength; Continuous improvements; Early warning; Early-warning mechanisms; Industrial enterprise; National economy; Safety accidents; Safety issues; Safety production; Safety supervision; Chemical industry",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139321318

With help of AI, we are currently able to automate a number of various tasks, including creation of visual, musical, or textual content. Ethical approach to design, development and utilization of AI systems as well as their legal compliance and robustness are defined as prerequisites of building trust and adoption of the technology. In this paper we analyze whether law supports ethics in the specific domain of automated journalism by examining principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency (the ART principles) from the perspective of legal interests protected by copyright and other laws. Other factors influencing ethical decision-making process, namely specificities of a business model and perception of authorship, are also taken into account. We present results of a recent pilot qualitative study illustrating that perception of authorship is closely related to perception of agency and responsibility. Our findings show that the current Czech law neither incentivizes implementation of the ART principles nor perception of agency in relation to AI systems for automated journalism. Perception of disappearing authorship may, thus, also lead to perception of disappearing responsibility. In order to solve these problems, we suggest introduction of new legal obligations and adaptation of existing personal rights to protect authors involved in the design of AI systems. © 2022 Digital Peer Publishing Licenses.

It costs a lot of money and takes a lot of work to create an SMS since it combines a lot of different technologies, including automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, the Internet of things (IoT) and semi-autonomous industrial systems. Green smart manufacturing (GSM) activities provide the foundation for creating ecologically friendly and green products. However, there are a number of other significant barriers obstacles to GSM deployment. As a result, removing this identification of these hurdles in a systematic manner should be a top focus of this study. Design/methodology/approach: This article seeks to identify and prioritize the nine barriers based on research and expert viewpoints on GSM challenges. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to prioritize the barriers. Findings: The result depicts that, financial constraints is the most important barrier that followed by scarcity of dedicated suppliers, concern to data security lack of understanding of the surroundings, inadequate top management commitment, proper handling of data interfaces lack of support by government, employees' lack of training, concern to data security lack of environment knowledge, fear of change/resistance and constraints of technology. Research limitations/implications: The current research will help the manufacturing industry in Industry 4.0 to identify potential barriers to GSM implementation. Originality/value: Green manufacturing (GM) entails the implementation of renewable production methods and eco-friendly procedures in manufacturing businesses. This study helps manufacturers come up with recycling and creative products, and manufacturers can give back to the environment by protecting natural areas by getting rid of the obstacles that get in the way. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AHP; Automotive industry; Green; Industry 4.0; Smart manufacturing","Electronic data interchange; Embedded systems; Flow control; Hierarchical systems; Human resource management; Industrial management; Industrial research; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Personnel training; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Conventional manufacturing; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Green; Industrial systems; Manufacturing activities; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing methods; Smart manufacturing; Automotive industry",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139261546

This calls for government authorities pay attention to public opinions and sentiments towards AI. Nonetheless, there is limited knowledge on what the drivers behind the public perception of AI are. Bridging this gap is the rationale of this paper. As the methodological approach, the study conducts an online public perception survey with the residents of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and explores the collected survey data through statistical analysis. The analysis reveals that: (a) the public is concerned of AI invading their privacy, but not much concerned of AI becoming more intelligent than humans; (b) the public trusts AI in their lifestyle, but the trust is lower for companies and government deploying AI; (c) the public appreciates the benefits of AI in urban services and disaster management; (d) depending on the local context, public perceptions vary; and (e) the drivers behind the public perception include gender, age, AI knowledge, and AI experience.

Methods: A qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews conducted at the target site and across other Italian hospitals. A content analysis was undertaken, emergent themes were selected and categorized, and interviews were conducted until saturation was reached. Results: Sixteen nurses (10 at the target site and six across other hospitals) and nine non-nursing professionals (seven at the target site and two across other hospitals) were interviewed. An organizational redesign was identified as the primary adoption driver. Even though nurses perceived workload increase related to the machine-learning component, technology acceptability was relatively high, as the standardization of tasks was perceived as crucial to improving professional satisfaction. Conclusions: A novel business-oriented solution based on machine learning requires interprofessional integration, new professional roles, infrastructure improvement, and data integration to be effectively implemented.

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Technology, Megatrends and Work. Of all the profound changes in business, technology is perhaps the most ubiquitous. There is not a facet of our lives unaffected by internet technologies and artificial intelligence. The Journal of Business Ethics established a dedicated section that focuses on Technology and Business Ethics, yet issues related to this phenomenon run right through all the sections. Kirsten Martin, editor of the Technology and Business Ethics section, joins our interim social media editor, Hannah Trittin-UIbrich, to advance a human-centric approach to the development and application of digital technologies that places Business Ethics at centre of the analysis. For Shuili Du, technology is the defining condition for a new era of Corporate Social Responsibility—CSR 3.0—which she defines as “a company’s socially responsible strategies and practices that deal with key ethical and socio-technical issues associated with AI and related technologies on the one hand and leverage the power of AI and related technologies to tackle social and environmental problems on the other hand.” It is not just technologies that are a determining feature of our lives but technology companies, an argument made by Glen Whelan as he examines Big Business and the need for a Big Business Ethics as we try to understand the impact of Big Tech on our post-work world. Indeed, as noted by Ernesto Noronha and Premilla D’Cruz, megatrends in addition to advancement in technologies, namely globalization, the greening of economies, and changes in demographics and migration, are shaping the future for workers in ways previously unimaginable. Contributing to this important debate, Praveen Parboteeah considers the influence of another longstanding but oft overlooked megatrend, the role of religion in the workplace. Given the enormity of the influence of technology and other megatrends in our world, it is not surprising that this essay introduces ground-breaking ideas that speak to the future of business ethics research. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accountability; Artificial intelligence; Big business; Corporate social responsibility; Demographic challenge; Digital technology; Ecosystem; Global production networks; Just transition; Platforms; Post-work; Religion; Robots",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139201492

First, we explore how talent acquisition has transitioned from digital 1.0 to 3.0 (AI-enabled) as the digital tool redesigns business. The technology of artificial intelligence has facilitated the daily work of recruiters and improved recruitment efficiency. Further, the study analyzes that AI plays an important role in each stage of recruitment, such as recruitment promotion, job search, application, screening, assessment, and coordination. Next, after interviewing with AI recruitment stakeholders (recruiters, managers, and applicants), the study discusses their acceptance criteria for each recruitment stage; stakeholders also raised concerns about AI recruitment. Finally, we suggest that managers need to be concerned about the cost of AI recruitment, legal privacy, recruitment bias, and the possibility of replacing recruiters. Overall, the study answers the following questions: (1) How artificial intelligence is used in various stages of the recruitment process. (2) Stakeholder (applicants, recruiters, managers) perceptions of AI application in recruitment. (3) Suggestions for managers to adopt AI in recruitment.

Real-time job information on recruitment platforms can, therefore, accurately reflect the demand for talent from businesses, serving as a basis for the creation of training policies in schools. In international competition, the development of talents, especially top-level talents, will become more and more crucial. Growing in importance is China's economy and social development. The evaluation of higher vocational and technical talents, however, should also be assessed from a variety of angles, given the diversification of talent training objectives and teaching methods, as well as the expansion of teaching functions. An emerging machine learning technology called deep learning (DL) has been developed to bring machine learning closer to the goals of artificial intelligence. This essay offers a thorough evaluation of the depth of deep learning as it relates to the development of innovative talent in schools. The entire school must be strengthened.

However, as the size of semiconductor processes becomes smaller and smaller, the reduction of size brings problems such as quantum tunneling effect, Moore's law is unsustainable, advanced packaging technologies came into being. With the technological evolution in the ""More Moore""and ""More than Moore""era, complex device designs emerge in endlessly, the number of test data is increasing in geometric order, the test engineering technology is becoming more and more complex, which all aggravate the demand for new technologies in IC test services.The heterogeneous integration is one of the main trends of ""More than Moore""era. The introduction of Multi Chip Packaging and Heterogeneous Chip Stack Packaging needs to ensure that each chip involved in sealing is a known good die (KGD). If any chip is defective, it means that the whole product is unqualified, which has an impact on the yield, development cost and time to market. Therefore, under any conditions, it is the key to detect the defective chip as early as possible. This makes many test items that can be carried out after packaging must be tested in full function and full parameters at the wafer-level according to the mass production standards, so as to ensure the quality and reliability of chips involved in packaging. Some types of chips like logic and memory have little difference between wafer sorting and final testing, but for RF chips, it is very difficult to realize automatic test at wafer level, especially the test of RF signals above GHz.In this paper, some test methods of RF chip KGD are introduced with their advantages and disadvantages. Automatic Test Equipment and Membrane Probe Card are used to realize the automatic mass production test of RF chip KGD. At the same time, the technology of the virtual instrument is integrated into the test system and the instruments such as the RF signal source and spectrum analyzer are controlled by the remote host for the testing. Based on the signal isolation and impedance matching design method, the high frequency and low noise of RF signal paths are ensured. Through the above scheme, a 10GHz frequency synthesizer chip is tested and verified. The working principle of the tested chip is introduced, the noise sources of it are fully analyzed and the test method of the output frequency and phase noise parameters are mainly discussed. The actual test results show that the output frequency of the chip is about 10GHz, the phase noise is about -104dBc/Hz@1KHz in integer mode and -99dBc/Hz@1KHz in fraction mode. Then the automatic mass production test of the whole wafer is completed, the test results are accord with normal distribution. Finally, the KGD testing technology is summarized and prospected. © 2022 IEEE.","Frequency synthesizer; Known Good Die; More than Moore; testing","Chip scale packages; Computation theory; Defects; Design for testability; Electric power utilization; Equipment testing; Frequency synthesizers; Packaging; Silicon wafers; Data clouds; Known-good dies; Mass production test; More than Moore; Output frequency; Phase-noise; RF signal; Test method; Testing technology; Wafer level; Spectrum analyzers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139142657

The novelty of this article is that we show that defined concepts created by the human mind can be passed on to an artificial intelligence-based expert system. The expert system helps the human mind to settle the logical connections between the defined terms and the conceptual model thus the created model will be better than what man could have set up without an expert system. The appearance and role of employee turnover has become a more and more important factor in the daily business of corporate life. Scientific journals have examined the positive and negative effects of it, which has also provided useful knowledge for practitioners. These articles have examined the impact of employee turnover in countless aspects, but one aspect was the same in all literature: the impact of turnover on a company is not negligible and cannot be ignored in terms of neither material nor moral aspects. As a starting point for our research, we systematically reviewed the literature on employee turnover and selected six concepts that are bilaterally related to our phenomenon. Based on the terms and the correlation of it, we created a conceptual model that was examined with the help of an artificial intelligence-based system. To select a system, we reviewed the classifications of the artificial intelligence-based systems which can model human decision making and can help our research. Relying on the processing of the literature review articles, we selected and briefly characterized a rule-based reasoning system, and investigated the rule constellations of it, which can model the turnover cases as the topic of our study. Based on our experience in observing, consulting, and working with decision-makers, we examined the aspects of employee turnover phenomenon in the analysis and we constructed a three-level model that found logical relationships between each subcategory and was able to realistically reflect certain behavioral patterns of the physical workforce of a manufacturing company. The analysis was performed using a rule-based system, which used logical rules and found classical “if-then” connections in the employee behavior cases. According to our examination, our outcomes can provide credible results for further research activities as well as for practitioners. © 2022, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

As a result of technological developments, working and daily life continues to change day by day. The changes lead to the emergence of new business lines, job opportunities, and opportunities. Due to the developments brought by Industry 4.0, businesses can reach new methods, especially about producing, developing, and distributing their products. The manufacturing operations are transforming with innovations such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning. Due to innovative technologies, labor-intensive classical production facilities are turning into smart factories. Smart factories provide great opportunities in terms of efficiency and productivity by using advanced sensors, software, and robotic manufacturing tools that collect and analyze data for better decision-making. However, there are a few barriers that businesses must overcome to make the most of the benefits and technological developments that come with Industry 4.0. The main barriers to overcome in the implementation of Industry 4.0 are described as follows: 1) enterprises have insufficient digital infrastructure, 2) the knowledge and skills of managers are insufficient about operational technology, 3) capital expenditures priorities of business owners are different, and 4) cybersecurity concerns. This study addresses a decision-making model for prioritizing the barriers that businesses may encounter in the Industry 4.0 transition process. In the proposed model, four barriers are evaluated by four experts regarding numerical and verbal factors under five criteria. To reflect expert opinions more comprehensively, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology is used to determine the most and least critical barriers that enterprises may face during Industry 4.0 transition process. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Industry 4.0; Intuitionistic fuzzy logic; MCDM; VIKOR",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139035580

One of the main pillars of this paradigm is Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM), which aims to get workpieces “right the first time”. However, this technological uplift can prove itself to be very challenging in an industrial environment especially when it comes to the choice of available sensors, the motivation behind that choice, and the insurance that they comply with different guidelines for further exploitation in decision support. This is even more relevant when addressing low-volume high-variety industrial entities such as make-to-order (MTO) SMEs, inherently characterized by limited resources and highly variable business processes collaborating to respond to the demands of an increasingly cutting-edged market. This paper presents a collaborative approach to devise a suitable sensor network in an industrial machining environment generally and in an MTO SME context specifically, based on a joint analysis of all business process data related to quality control issues.

Therefore, an evaluation system is established to calculate the index (product success index) composed of three factors: actual star rating of consumers, star rating of review analysis, and star rating of product popularity (star rating of products over time). We use AHP to determine the weights between these three factors. We then select the products we consider most successful based on the calculated product success index and found that users are most concerned about product quality, price and security. At the same time, to solve the question of whether a particular review affects subsequent ratings. We used a two-way ANOVA method to analyze whether specific reviews in the early stages would affect the stars in later stages. We found that the p-value is concentrated between 0.1-0.2, which means the specific star rating is considered to have an impact on the evaluation. Finally, we suggest that Merchants and platforms should pay more attention to the characteristics of successful products and early product feedback.

However, government policy and recent technological innovations do not address the digital carbon footprint of organizations. The paper aims to present the concept of single-use dark data and how knowledge reuse by organizations is a means to digital decarbonization. Design/methodology/approach: Businesses in all sectors must contribute to reducing digital carbon emissions globally, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to examine “how” from a knowledge (re)use perspective. Drawing on insights from the knowledge creation process, the paper presents a set of pathways to greater knowledge reuse for the reduction of organizations’ digital carbon footprint. Findings: Businesses continually collect, process and store knowledge but generally fail to reuse these knowledge assets – referred to as dark data. Consequently, this dark data has a huge impact on energy use and global emissions. This model is the first to show explicit pathways that businesses can follow to sustainable knowledge practices. Practical implications: If businesses are to be proactive in their collective pursuit of net-zero, then it becomes paramount that reducing the digital carbon footprint becomes a key sustainability target. The paper presents how this might be accomplished, offering practical and actionable guidance to businesses for digital decarbonization. Originality/value: Two critical questions are facing businesses: how can decarbonization be achieved? And can it be achieved at a low-cost? Awareness of the damaging impact digitalization may be having on the environment is in its infancy, yet knowledge reuse is a proactive and cost-effective route to reduce carbon emissions, which is explored in the paper. © 2022, Thomas W.

In this pandemic situation, almost all the business applications came online at the same time. There is an enormous bandwidth flood on the Internet as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation invites issues related to traffic management, load balancing, and security. This chapter focuses on providing edge security, and as we all know the security issue is nonlinear and adversarial by nature. We need to invent new solutions to provide edge security. We can use the area of artificial intelligence to provide edge security. The statistical techniques related to machine learning as well as deep learning will be more beneficial. A generative adversarial network, a deep-learning method, can play a vital role in providing security at various levels. We discuss the dataset standardization process in detail. The security measures mentioned above for hybrid software-defined networks are studied, which can be a game changer in the networking field.

Established on theory of platform leverage in the value creation, we use causal analysis and case studies to explore two closely related questions with data of 31 digital platforms (including 21 focal cases and 10 reference cases): (i) what is the value creation mechanism of these digital platforms? and (ii) how does the value creation mechanism affect the construction path of the system? The study identified three typical value creation mechanism configurations, i.e., innovation-driven, business integration, and data-driven, and then explained the system construction paths of these three configurations. We observed that the production and innovation leverages are the general construction drivers of the platform. However, the transaction leverage is only significant in a small number of platforms; that is, the role of network effects can be observed. These findings can deepen our understanding of platform theory in the digitalization of the real economy and explain why network effects cannot be the source of competitive advantage within the economic digitalization scenarios. We believe that it is of great significance to the digital transformation practice of the economy. © 2022 Huayao Zhang et al.",,"Competition; Data integration; Case-studies; Causal analysis; Digital platforms; Driving forces; Driving systems; Network effects; System construction; Typical values; Value creation; Value creation mechanisms; Intelligent systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138897310

With the development and application of new generation technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology, China is in the stage of financial technology 3.0 under the deep integration of finance and technology. In the field of financial technology, the most concerned is the application of blockchain technology in trade finance business. With the successive construction of various blockchain platforms and the acceleration of the internationalization process, the international trade credit risk behind it is also increasing. Among many financial services, trade finance is the most closely integrated field with blockchain technology. In this context, preventing the risks in the business process of international trade enterprises, so as to reduce the cost of financial transactions, improve the effectiveness of financial services, and better serve the real economy is not only the internal development needs of enterprises, but also the national financial strategy needs. In view of the above problems, this paper analyzes the risk factors faced by multinational trading enterprises in the transaction process through the transaction data of some multinational enterprises on mobile phones, and constructs a credit evaluation system of international trading enterprises based on blockchain, in order to enhance the trade risk resistance ability of international trading companies. © 2022 GuoHua Lian.",,"Finance; International trade; Risk assessment; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Credit algorithms; Data clouds; Deep integrations; Development and applications; Financial service; New generation technology; Trade enterprise; Trade financings; Blockchain",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138860904

Hence, there is an urgent need to understand how Industry 4.0 can be a valuable model for fulfilling various requirements of the health care sector using different and emerging technologies for providing affordable services, specifically in the perspective of an emerging market economy. The objective of this chapter is to comprehend the applicability of Industry 4.0 in the health care sector through the case analysis of Narayana Health City Bengaluru, India, and to do the mapping to recognize the domains of Industry 4.0 explored and implemented by them for providing affordable medical care, timely diagnosis and for remote diagnosis enabling more and more patients to be covered thereby promoting health inclusion for all. Various published sources in the form of research papers based on Industry 4.0 for the health care sector were studied to identify applications and future research direction. The study is primarily based on secondary data, explicitly using the interview insights given by Dr Devi Shetty to Prof Tarun Khanna, Harvard Business School, in 2017. Industry 4.0 has aunique methodology for generating new concepts and undertaking its applicability in the health care sector through proper integration of emergent technologies like Artificial Intelligence or Big Data Analytics, smart machines, and software. Narayana Health City has given an entirely new dimension of providing affordable critical and specialized health care services to even remote areas. Using safe and fortified medical-grade networks with immersive visual experiences, they can virtualize every scarce resource that includes medical force, right from surgeons to paramedics to staff, and provide continuous access of specialist consultants remotely and have the facility of telemedicine. The hospital has touched upon some of the dimensions of Health 4.0 like precise surgery, digitally controlled devices, telemedicine for remote healthcare, resulting in better services for patients at an affordable cost.

This review paper aims to present future research opportunities and challenges for the facilitation of DM for digital supply chain (DSC) by emerging digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). After a review of DM, we identify three distinct types of DM platforms that may facilitate DSC based on transaction mechanisms. These are then explored from a technological perspective, in terms of enabling technologies and data analysis methods that support DM for DSC.

This can be a problem when designing interactive systems that incorporate AI elements, since the design can fail to take into account tacit knowledge and context-specific requirements of people that execute the process. While recent discourse has highlighted this gap and called for an exploration into light-weight, grassroots modeling techniques that can be used to model everyday work, it is still unclear how these can be harnessed to design information systems that support work. The aim of this paper is to showcase how a triangulated approach combining three different perspectives - grassroots modeling, theoretical grounding, and first person media, can be used to collaboratively model an informal work activity and design an AI-enabled system to instruct novices to perform that activity. Our experience confirms the assertion that, when provided with the necessary scaffolding, experts without any formal modeling experience can be supported to model their specific, local activities and, in doing so, contribute valuable knowledge to the design of information systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Activity theory; Artificial intelligence; Event storming; Grassroots modeling; Information systems; Worker assistance system; Worker assistant","Information use; Scaffolds; Activity Theory; Assistance system; Assistant designs; Event storming; Grassroot modeling; Practical use; Worker assistance system; Worker assistant; Workers'; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138786246

In the industry, RPA vendors have not only provided out-of-the-box RPA bots to automate manual tasks on legacy software; they have also provided users a recorder to create their own bots for specialized tasks. However, if these recorders do not create generalizable bots, users risk facing a “bot sprawl” and governance problem. Building generalizable bots currently requires intervention from IT departments which are typically oversubscribed given their limited resources. Furthermore, the generalization process is typically long and tedious; it does not scale to cover the expansive needs of business users. We thus need a tool that can empower business users to act as citizen developers and build generalized bots themselves. In this work, we argue that the next generation of RPA bots must leverage artificial intelligence to learn from user interactions (through natural language or other modalities intuitive to citizen developers) and generalize to unseen settings. To achieve this, we first survey and assess the current state of the art in the RPA field for enabling citizen developers; and identify several key research challenges at the intersection of AI, RPA, and interactive task learning that must be addressed to realize the vision of RPA bots that continually learn new automation solutions from user interactions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Learning; Robotic process automation; Teaching by instruction","Botnet; Intelligent robots; Learning systems; Automation vendors; Business enterprise; Business-users; Learn+; Learning; Legacy software; Process automation; Robotic process automation; Teaching by instruction; User interaction; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138760311

One of the major characteristics that makes AI enhanced services ideal for use in organisations is their ability to complete jobs faster and more accurately than humans. Almost all firms are utilising AI-based Chatbots on social media and messaging applications such as Whats App, Facebook, and others to engage with their enormous consumer base and provide real-time help. But AI is capable of much more. For many individuals, having a discussion with a bot that sounds like a human is a new disruption, and it serves as a tool to engage and entice customers to the point where they leave the website. But AI do more than just that. Having a conversation with a bot which feels like a human talking is a new disruption for a lot of people and it works as a tool to engage these customers and attract them in such a way that they leave the website after making the purchase. And as far as disruption is concerned from guiding the customer how to order pizza to describing through complex sales processes, AI Chatbots have been able to help both B2C and B2B interactions.

Today, a large percentage of daily communication takes place on instant messaging applications and social networks. In fact, there has been a considerable increase in the use of social networks because new social networks are being created for specific purposes, such as the search for employment or tourism. When the amount of content on a social network is large, it is necessary to help users find content of their interest. In this regard, artificial intelligence techniques can greatly facilitate the task of searching for relevant content. This paper presents a recommender system for a business and employment oriented social network, on which users are recommended job offers and other user profiles to follow. The presented system is based on virtual organizations of agents, and uses artificial neural networks to determine whether job offers and users should be recommended or not. The system has been evaluated on a real social network; its recommendations regarding job offers and user profiles have had a high acceptance rate. © 2022 The Authors.

We answer this question by providing a brief review of the evolution of technologies and operations management (OM) over time. Because terms such as “Industry 4.0” do not have a precise definition, we focus on more fundamental issues raised by Industry 4.0 emerging technologies for research in OM. We propose a theory of disruptive debottlenecking and the SACE framework by classifying emerging technologies in terms of the functionalities they enable: sense, analyze, collaborate, and execute. Subsequently, we review the nascent but rapidly growing literature at the interface between digital technologies and OM. Our review suggests that one way to assess the value of Industry 4.0 technologies can be via their influence on adding revenues, differentiating, reducing costs, optimizing risks, innovating, and transforming business models and processes. Finally, we conclude by proposing an agenda for further research. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.","additive manufacturing; artificial intelligence (AI); blockchain; business excellence; digital transformation; governance; Industry 4.0; information technology (IT); internet of things (IOT); operations; strategy; supply chain management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138705274

Many global agribusinesses have successfully integrated digital technologies to enhance operational efficiencies and business relations with their upstream and downstream actors. However, evidence is scant on the uptake of digital technologies among small and medium agribusiness firms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Against this backdrop, this review paper identifies research gaps regarding the adoption and implication of digitalization in building sustainable food systems for African economies. Our preliminary finds show some sustainable practices in the SSA food supply chains by adopting specific technologies related to production, grain storage, food waste management, and warehouse management but very low adoption of food processing technologies and digital marketing platforms. Most importantly, the application of the Internet of Things, Big data, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and/or Business Analytics is very rare. Most of the digitalization process tends to be mobile-based. © 2022, International Journal on Food System Dynamics.

These decision-making models are based on descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. A legislative framework that oversees all digital development uniformly across countries and facilitates a fully regulated digital transformation process is required.

AI and machine learning are all closely linked with using a computer to simulate intelligent behaviour with little human interaction. It has been noticed that many large organisations are implementing technologies such as ML and AI to improve their performance and productivity in the business. Companies can create better, more customised and engaging campaigns as AI becomes increasingly adept at collecting massive data faster than ever before. As AI and ML technologies become more widely used, being a technology-powered company will undoubtedly be a must for survival. AI and ML are guiding on everything from production to delivering products and services to customers. Machine translation, chatbots, and self-learning algorithms are examples of AI technology that may help people better comprehend their surroundings and respond appropriately. Organisations have been embracing artificial intelligence technology advancements to create and maximising their strategic and competitive advantages. Hence, businesses rely heavily on AI to enhance their performance and develop new services to boost productivity and generate new offerings. In addition, they are fundamentally reshaping companies' business and operation processes to better meet customers’ requirements and expectations, resulting in increased efficiency. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are broad concepts that will be examined further in this article. The report aims to understand the relationship between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in large and diversified business organisations.

Therefore, in order to improve the teaching level of Chinese colleges and improve the knowledge reserve of college students, we should spare no effort to develop and improve the professional level of each teacher. The research on teacher training mode based on the development of teachers' teaching ability is of great significance to the development of colleges and the improvement of teaching quality. The new generation of artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in the training of college teachers. This paper randomly selects 897 undergraduate teachers from 10 private colleges in a certain region of China who participate in higher teacher training for research. It mainly studies the application effect of several typical artificial intelligence technologies in evaluating higher teacher education and training. Specifically, the paper uses artificial intelligence as a carrier to predict the performance indicators of the three main modules involved in higher teacher education and training. The prediction results of several artificial intelligence techniques show that the support vector machine method based on immune algorithm optimization corresponds to the largest coefficient of determination and the smallest root mean square error. Therefore, it predicts the best. Furthermore, the comparison results between the predicted data and the measured data show that the artificial intelligence technology has a better prediction effect on the three module indicators. At the same time, there is a good exponential function relationship between the prediction data corresponding to the two main modules of organization and personnel. © 2022 Hao Deng et al.",,"Exponential functions; Mean square error; Personnel training; Students; Support vector machines; Teaching; Artificial intelligence technologies; Business knowledge; College teachers; Education and training; Innovative method; Knowledge system; Main module; Teacher education; Teacher training; Teachers'; Forecasting",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138477836

This has been restricting the development of modern AIS. Based on this, first, this paper studies the influence of the knowledge economy on accounting innovation and in the innovation economy. The process of confirmation for accounting elements in economic business, under the traditional AIS, is analyzed. Then, the model of the accounting element confirmation, i.e., BPNN, is constructed by combining the backpropagation (BP) neural network (NN) theory with the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. Finally, we simulate the confirmation process of accounting elements based on the economic business data of specific online stores. The experimental outcomes illustrate that under the proposed BPNN model, the output value of the accounting entry is also increasing and has been in the interval [0, 0.14] with the continuous increase in the input value of economic business activities. Moreover, the overall simulation error of economic business activity data does not exceed 0.3% in the simulation test of the proposed accounting business data confirmation model based on the BPNN algorithm. The empirical outcomes indicate that the model has high accuracy and reliability. The purpose is to realize the identification of business events by machines and complete the automatic confirmation of accounting elements in the back-end economic business of online stores.

In this new era of Industrial Revolution 4.0, the mining industry too has inevitably started to focus on technology and digitalisation. As there are many challenges ahead in this transformation process, DMT's approach to this new era is to offer innovative and holistic Industry 4.0 solutions developed through a fastidious strategy which is expected in assisting to shape the autonomous mining vision of the future. DMT's approach to this digital transformation is to go through initially a ""Digital Due Diligence Process"" to assess the existing business, identify digital potentials and operating opportunities and define a digitalisation roadmap. DMT's recommendation is that this process is accompanied by independent engineering and technology advice coming from an experienced partner in process design who will establish a ""Digital Transformation Office"" how these identified points can deliver the expected quality, efficiency, and improvements in health and safety in line with the environmental sustainability. This approach includes three fundamental components: “Operations” which cover the services used to provide companies with comprehensive guidance and support, systematic approaches to continually expand the offering of digital products and services covering the entire lifecycle of raw material extraction such as Reconnaissance, Exploration, Planning and Project Evaluation, Construction, Optimisation of Mining Operations, Environmental Aspects, Mine Closure and Site Remediation; “People"" which covers a corresponding digital transformation program for all employees of mining companies; “Processes” which covers process optimisation for its Clients' operations.

First, the role of big tech companies like Google and Amazon within contemporary capitalism, including their deployment of labor and current proposals to better regulate and tax them. While we begin with a focus on the use of labor by big tech companies, we also consider how their effects ripple out to other sectors of the economy by virtue of the hardware and software foundations that they provide for virtually all businesses. The second set of debates that we canvas centers on the influence of automation on employment, emphasizing that automation does not merely replace labor, but also transforms it while reshaping its organization. Given the appetite of capital for technology (as a means to increase productivity and profit as well as secure competitive advantage), we explore in what areas humans currently, and perhaps always will, enjoy a comparative advantage over machines. Here we consider not only capabilities and cost, but also ethical questions surrounding the replacement of human labor with machines, especially in the domain of care work. Finally, in the conclusion, we consider the role of technology in ushering in a post-work society. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Automation; Big tech; Care work; Work",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138195349

Currently, there are two schools of thought on improving the performance of AI systems: model-centric AI and data-centric AI. In model-centric AI, developers of an AI system successively upgrade a devised model (algorithm/code), while holding the amount and type of data collected fixed. Conversely, practitioners of the data-centric AI keep the model fixed, while continuously improving the quality of data. Despite its dominance over the past three decades, model-centric AI has been recently criticised as being limited to businesses and industries where consumer platforms with hundreds of millions of users can freely rely on generalized solutions. This paper, rather than favoring any of the two approaches, supports a 'both and' position. We argue that overcoming the alleged limitation of model-centric AI may well require paying extra attention to the alternative data-centric approach. However, this shouldn't result in reducing interest in model-centric AI. We corroborate our position by the notion that successful 'problem solving' requires considering both the way we act upon things (algorithm) as well as harnessing knowledge of their states and properties (data). © 2022 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; data-centric AI; Industry 4.0; machine learning; model-centric AI","Machine learning; Artificial intelligence systems; Data centric; Data clouds; Data-centric artificial intelligence; Machine-learning; Model-centric artificial intelligence; Paradigm shifts; Performance; System models; Voluminous data; Industry 4.0",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138170135

Circular economy has led to the formation of sustainable business models. Artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities change work activities, data flows, and organizational processes. The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of adoption of AI on circular economy practices in the organization. The research questions include: What are the factors affecting the adoption of AI in manufacturing companies? What effect does the adoption of AI have on the CE practices in the organization? In the first phase, research constructs are identified and a conceptual model is developed based on previous studies. In the second phase, the research model is evaluated among 97 manufacturing companies in the Middle East. Structural equation model and Smart PLS software have been used for data analysis. The findings show that the technology characteristics, organizational capabilities and external task environment have an effect on adoption of AI, and adoption of AI has a positive effect on circular economy practices. Based on the results, AI technology can be a solution to change the production process and reduce the destructive effects of industry on the environment. Managers of manufacturing companies can use the capabilities of machine learning, intelligence and neural networks to manage resources and optimize product production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Circular economy; Environmental pollution; Manufacturing industries; Middle east; Sustainable development",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138166014

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) and a case study have been undertaken to explore the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain developed after the COVID-19 outbreak. Having conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases Google Scholar, Emerald Insight, ScienceDirect and ProQuest, 69 articles were selected and reviewed. A case of the Kering Group was used to explain the results. Findings: This paper highlighted the basic concepts of a sustainable supply chain, reviewed the 10 principles of the United Nation Global Compact and their connections to promoting supply chain sustainability, as well as the three components of a sustainable supply chain: green supply chain, transparent supply chain and circular supply chain. Based on the results of a SLR and a real case of Kering Group, the paper identified 12 innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain: (1) biodegradable and natural materials, (2) textile recycling, (3) nearshoring, (4) artificial intelligence (AI), (5) robot, (6) 3D printing, (7) Internet of Things, (8) blockchain, (9) reverse resources; (10) bio-packaging, (11) augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and (12) digital runway. Research limitations/implications: The epidemiological situations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding innovative ideas for a sustainable supply chain may change over time. While this paper provides a comprehensive literature review and case study, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts in the development of a sustainable fashion supply chain through collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Practical implications: Embracing the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of this study are further explained by the case of Kering Group in the fashion industry. The managerial implications of the results and discussion are the need to adopt innovative ideas for a more sustainable fashion supply chain in the future. The success of sustainable supply chains work by leveraging the best available technologies such as robot, 3D printing, AR and VR, setting consistent standards for sustainability such as Environmental Profit and Loss and Kering & Textile Exchange and communicating with all parties throughout the supply chain, such as blockchain and AI. Investment in developing technology and innovative ideas will be the key of future to supply chain sustainability. Nonetheless, the specific approach used by each organization must be tailored to its characteristics, goals and circumstances. Social implications: Bringing upon unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has shown both companies and consumers just how fragile our planet is. Thus, to protect our planet in the long run, we need to not only make businesses more sustainable but also live more eco-friendly lifestyles. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work that conducts a systemic review of the relevant academic journal articles addressed to the managerial audience on sustainable (fashion) supply chain. In addition, this paper also adds some consideration to this gap by exploring the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain in the future and using a case to illustrate how these ideas can be put in a real-life context.

Responsible AI governance should be viewed as a source of competitive edge rather than merely a quick fix for automating manual processes. Despite this, little empirical evidence is available to support this claim, and even less is understood about the dimensions and relationships that add business value. This paper develops a conceptual model to explain how responsible AI governance practices aligned with strategic goals lead to competitive performance gains. An investigation of 144 Nordic firms is conducted to verify our hypotheses using a PLS-SEM analysis.

This study embraces the dynamic capabilities theory, uses ideas from the accelerated corporate transformation, and posits that adaptive transformation capability, driven by ambidextrous artificial intelligence (AI) use, i.e., routine and innovative use in practice, serves as a mechanism for firms to gain superior organizational performance under COVID-19. Using a composite-based structural equation model (SEM) approach, we use survey data from 257 C-level practitioners with key decision-making roles and experience in AI and digital transformation initiatives. We used this data to analyze the theorized relationships. Outcomes show that the ambidextrous use of AI positively enhances a firm’s adaptive transformation capability. This capability, in turn, fully mediates the impact of AI ambidexterity on competitive performance during COVID-19. These outcomes have important theoretical and practical implications. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Adaptive transformation capability; Ambidexterity; Artificial intelligence; Competitive performance; Composited-based SEM; COVID-19; Dynamic capability; PLS-SEM","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Enterprise resource management; Metadata; Adaptive transformation capability; Adaptive transformations; Ambidexterity; Competitive performance; Composited; Composited-based structural equation model; Dynamics capability; PLS-structural equation model; Structural equation models; COVID-19",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137985877

Although firms are carefully considering this transition, the implementation of cobots is often carried out without careful consideration of the motivation and behavior of the employees working in hybrid workplaces. In the scenario when employees do not understand their work with cobots, it is unlikely that value is brought to a firm in the dynamic business environment. Thus, this study has multiple objectives. The first was to investigate the role of negative and positive valence factors on the employees intention to work with cobots. The second objective was to examine the effects of the creativity dimensions of employees on their behavior toward cobots. We developed a model for a hybrid workplace based on the componential theory of individual creativity and valence theory, in which the behaviors of human workers are combined with the dimensions of the cobots. Data were collected from 596 working professionals from India, and the proposed model was tested using partial least squares. We confirmed most of the hypotheses about the creativity of employees in hybrid workplaces and the positive valence of cobots with our empirical analysis. Therefore, we proved that future human-cobot collaboration needs to be focused not only on the benefits that cobots bring but also on human aspects like skills and expertise. This article is a contribution to the body of knowledge on new-age technology adoption by shedding light on the human and cobot dimensions. The results of this article may serve as a foundation for future applications and research on hybrid work.

DSCS has potential applications in risk management, supplier performance management, production planning, inventory optimization, quality management, supplier financing, and cost reduction in supply chains. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is potentially a key enabler and may facilitate a step change in DSCS. We present a framework, SDAR (Surveillance, Detection, Action, Response), to support the design of effective business processes for supply network surveillance. We outline the most important types of AI algorithms and models and discuss their applicability to a range of questions that arise in DSCS. By linking different surveillance data sources and systems, appropriate AI techniques can make surveillance easier, more informative, and scalable. However, AI-based DSCS gives rise to significant technical, ethical, and managerial challenges. These include the decomposition and reintegration of surveillance data and analyses, data imbalances, mitigation of biases in data, algorithms and statistical estimations, and the challenge of embedding DSCS in effective supplier monitoring and auditing processes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A data breach usually incurs significant (monetary) loss for a commercial organization. Conceptually, cloud security heavily relies on Identity Access Management (IAM) policies that IT admins need to properly configure and periodically update. Security negligence and human errors often lead to misconfiguring IAM policies which may open a backdoor for attackers. To address these challenges, first, we develop a novel framework that encodes generating optimal IAM policies using constraint programming (CP). We identify reducing dormant permissions of cloud users as an optimality criterion, which intuitively implies minimizing unnecessary datastore access permissions. Second, to make IAM policies interpretable, we use graph representation learning applied to historical access patterns of users to augment our CP model with similarity constraints: similar users should be grouped together and share common IAM policies. Third, we describe multiple attack models and show that our optimized IAM policies significantly reduce the impact of security attacks using real data from 8 commercial organizations, and synthetic instances. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Fremont Road, Idaho Falls, ID  83415, United States","Business analytics augmented by artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have revolutionized the role of data in the modern world. In recent years, businesses have incorporated data into their decision-making process for better prediction, risk assessment, content creation, etc. While such businesses often seek to leverage the full use of their data through third-party AI/ML services, they are often hampered by the risks of data leaks, reverse engineering, stolen technology, etc., that often have disastrous consequences for businesses and their stakeholders alike. This is especially relevant to the nuclear industry where proprietors are reluctant to share nuclear data for fear of misuse despite their willingness to integrate the additional insight provided by AI/ML applications and remain competitive. Thus, there arises a need for data masking prior to its transmission that obfuscates proprietary information while preserving the information relevant for AI/ML applications. In order to meet the needs of industrial data that are significantly different from those of data warehouses, previous work proposed an efficient time and space-scalable data masking paradigm known as the deceptive infusion of data (DIOD) methodology. The present work expands upon this work by leveraging existing reverse-engineering capabilities to facilitate the decomposition of industrial data into its proprietary and AI/ML-relevant parts, referred to as fundamental and inference metadata, respectively. Both sets of metadata are further obfuscated in accordance with the DIOD methodology to create the DIOD rendition of the industrial data, which is rendered immune to reverse engineering by discarding proprietary information and preserving only AI/ML–relevant information. Additionally, constraints of the original DIOD paper are relaxed using mutual information by configuring the methodology to the target AI/ML application to unlock the full potential of the DIOD methodology. Since the present work focuses on the nuclear industry, data from a nuclear reactor is transformed into that from a nonlinear spring-mass system with different levels of data masking as required by the generic system and the target AI/ML application. © 2022 American Nuclear Society.","Data masking; industrial data; machine learning; reverse engineering","Data warehouses; Decision making; Engineering education; Machine learning; Metadata; Nuclear industry; Risk assessment; Artificial intelligence learning; Business analytics; Data masking; Data methodology; Decision-making process; Industrial datum; Machine learning applications; Machine-learning; Prediction risks; Proprietary information; Reverse engineering",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137813370

Emerging technologies, e.g. robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), are redefining the concept of modern methods of construction and destabilising the structure of the sector to meet the conditions of their implementation. Robotics and machine-based automation, for example, are expected to transform construction manufacturing techniques in rapid and significant ways, but the extent of change and the associated impacts on organisations, supply chains and business models that constitute the sector remains unknown. Existing foresight is dominated by trajectorial perspectives that overemphasise technological predictions and underemphasise the contextual stories of implementation most helpful in understanding technology adoption. An alternative approach presented here focuses on storytelling, the design of the scenarios and the visual images used to help convey these scenarios. These allow practitioners to explore how robotics and machine-based automation may play out in different characterisations of the industry. The research involved the analysis of an existing dataset to create four scenarios, before adapting and extending these scenarios through participatory workshops and interviews. Project participants were comprised of seven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in manufacturing and architectural fabrication, one tier 1 contractor, and two acclaimed industry experts from an industry advisory board and education centre. PRACTICE RELEVANCE Robotics and machine-based automation are expected to transform the construction sector in rapid and significant ways, but the extent of change and associated impacts on organisations, supply chains and business models remains unknown. An alternative approach to foresight is presented that uses scenario creation to understand the implications of robotics and automation. The implications of robotics and automation are explored at the project, firm and industry levels. This will assist decision-makers to responsibly turn technological promise into substantive change. Four future scenarios of a construction industry where manufacturing robotics are business as usual are described. As an often-overlooked stakeholder, SMEs were at the centre of the scenario development process. Each scenario has a dominant player at the centre: tier 1 contractors, SME cooperatives, software vendors and original equipment manufacturers, and government. These scenarios illustrate the potential implications and non-technological innovations to resolve them (e.g. business model modification, development opportunities and contractual relationships), co-constructed with construction professionals. © 2022 The Author(s).","automation; construction industry; future studies; innovation; modern methods of construction (MMC); robotics; scenario planning; small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); strategic planning; technological change",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137813126

So why not use these technologies to efficiently manage the destination? The aim of this work is to define and implement a methodology that provides value to STDs by defining their most important characteristics to monitor and quantify them automatically in real time. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a conceptual framework to the smart tourism approach presented in previous studies, the latest technologies and the application of the smart tourism system (STS). Based on the focus group method with stakeholders from the tourism industry of the Spanish tourist municipality of Puerto de la Cruz, they defined the main KPIs for a municipal STD. Likewise, the authors specified the necessary technologies to obtain, manage and represent the data, and the method for quantifying the quality of the STD by using the AHP method. Lastly, they implemented the framework for the aforementioned municipality. Findings: The implementation in a real context of the STS proposed for Puerto de la Cruz demonstrates its validity and the possibility of adapting it to any other municipal destination. In addition, the authors corroborate how this STS improves on other versions. Originality/value: This paper provides a theoretical methodology to improve STD management and implements it.

This state of affairs makes it possible to establish a system of corporate control, the scope of the rights of each member of the corporation, and also to consider commercial corporations as a whole as an association of capital and (or) an association of persons. This article explores models of corporate governance in which a member of the corporation is not formally known or is completely absent. This study is not limited to the legal assessment of beneficial ownership of a corporation. A legal assessment is given of possible models of corporate governance that do not allow, both legally and actually, to truly establish the owner of the business. The bases for classification of models of impersonal management of a corporation are highlighted. Modern domestic corporate and judicial practice on the issue of using the model of “impersonal” management of a corporation is given. The possibility of identifying the deliberate use of the considered management model in the formation of the supreme body of the corporation, as well as the abuse of corporate rights in relation to the rights and legitimate interests of other members of the corporation and third parties (for example, creditors or government bodies) is being studied. The variability of the model of impersonal management of commercial corporations is revealed; the legal consequences of the application of this management model are determined; Ways of solving the issue of bringing liable persons to responsibility are proposed. Mechanisms for detecting the impersonal management of a corporation are proposed, including through the use of digital technologies. Criteria that determine the unfair use of this management model are analyzed. In the study, new approaches have been formed to identify the model of impersonal management of corporations by the courts and prevent their use. © 2022 Rostovskii Gosudarstvennyi Meditsinskii Universitet.

In an enterprise, there are multiple customers at the same time, and the production line can also generate multiple orders from different customers at the same time. That is to say, multiple projects are running at the same time, resulting in continuous changes in management processes, heavy project coordination tasks, and a serious waste of corporate resources. The resources that can be used are limited. In the production business using project management, how to rationally utilize the limited business scheduling resources has become the focus of research. Aiming at the method of business management resource scheduling, this paper investigates the application of enhanced particle swarm algorithm on the cloud deep learning platform, and the mapping problem between virtual machines and physical machines. As a heuristic algorithm, particle swarm optimization is suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems. By improving the diversity of particle hosts and setting parameters, it improves the integration speed and accuracy of the algorithm. Through the analysis of the current situation of multi-project business management, it examines the allocation of resources. In terms of business management, it has established a resource allocation model for multiple projects. The results show that the method improves the efficiency of the enterprise by 35% compared to the traditional method with a 20% reduction in personnel. A better configuration scheme is simulated by MATLAB, which verifies the scientificity and effectiveness of the method studied in this paper. © 2022 Lujie Zhu and Li Huang.",,"Competition; Deep learning; Heuristic algorithms; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Resource allocation; Scheduling; Waste management; 'current; Business management; Economic globalization; Enterprise IS; Enterprise management; International competitions; Management Model; Multiple projects; Resource-scheduling; Scheduling methods; Sales",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137620466

However, the inherent heterogeneity in smart grid services and requirements pose significant challenges towards the definition of a unified network architecture. In this context, radio access network (RAN) slicing emerges as a key 5G enabler to ensure interoperable connectivity and service management in the smart grid. This article introduces a novel RAN slicing framework which leverages the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to support IEC 61850 smart grid services. With the aid of deep reinforcement learning, efficient radio resource management for RAN slices is attained, while conforming to the stringent performance requirements of a smart grid selfhealing use case. Our research outcomes advocate the adoption of emerging AI-native approaches for RAN slicing in beyond- 5G systems, and lay the foundations for differentiated service provisioning in the smart grid.

Converting documents into a machine-processable format is a particular challenge here due to their huge variability in formats and complex structure. Accordingly, many algorithms and machine-learning methods emerged to solve particular tasks such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), layout analysis, table-structure recovery, figure understanding, etc. We observe the adoption of such methods in document understanding solutions offered by all major cloud providers. Yet, publications outlining how such services are designed and optimized to scale in the cloud are scarce. In this paper, we focus on the case of document conversion to illustrate the particular challenges of scaling a complex data processing pipeline with a strong reliance on machine-learning methods on cloud infrastructure. Our key objective is to achieve high scalability and responsiveness for different workload profiles in a well-defined resource budget. We outline the requirements, design, and implementation choices of our document conversion service and reflect on the challenges we faced. Evidence for the scaling behavior and resource efficiency is provided for two alternative workload distribution strategies and deployment configurations. Our best-performing method achieves sustained throughput of over one million PDF pages per hour on 3072 CPU cores across 192 nodes. © 2022 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; cloud applications; distributed computing; document understanding","Budget control; Data handling; Machine learning; Pipeline processing systems; Business Process; Cloud applications; Cloud services; Complexes structure; Data driven; Document conversion; Document understanding; High-throughput; Machine learning methods; Processable; Optical character recognition",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137560876

This raises issues about new technologies' influence on future business structures, particularly in service-based industries like finance.

Different perspectives on any of the two technologies mentioned above are insufficient for understanding potential synergies in financial services. Similarly, the internet of things (IoT) assistance for FinTech solutions has risen its significance in the upcoming transaction world. Therefore, this research proposes a distributed hyper ledger technology and AI for IoT-based FinTech platform (DHLT-AI-FTP), which incorporates the benefits of each technology for secured and energy-efficient financial transactions and communication.

Hence, protecting the advantages that AI applications and IoT devices provide must remain the primary concern for today’s organizations. In this article, Holistic Feistel Authentication and Learning-based Authorization (HFA-LA) method present this for protecting IoT applications against cyberattacks. More specifically, a lightweight authentication approach is designed by exploring the use of Feistel Block Message Authentication by the cloud service manager to identify the authenticated devices. A holistic authentication and authorization approaches is designed. In which Artificial Intelligent Feed Forward Learning and trust management via error measurement are adopted to analyze the IoT applications to access the cloud resources. This new HFA-LA method establish the connections between IoT devices and cloud services and combat against cyberattacks so that the communication latency (i.e., communication time and overhead) is improved, and security risks are well controlled for IoT applications. Simulation is performed with different metrics, such as, communication time, communication overhead, true positive rate, and false-positive rate.

Many countries have become over dependent on external sources for many basic commodities affecting the local primary sector. Food security is a major concern to small islands states like Mauritius and one major issue is the high cost of production and labor scarcity. Artificial intelligence can now be used to support the local entrepreneurs in their businesses, but the major problem is barrier to the introduction of new technologies due to lack of technical support to the local entrepreneurs. This project aims at the design of a system that is capable of harvesting tomatoes indoor in an autonomous way for an entrepreneur involved in Mauritius, who is currently facing various problems related mostly to a shortage of labour. The system was designed specifically for the company taking into consideration its requirements and constraints. The proposed system was a 3-axis robotic arm mounted on an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) capable of picking tomatoes using computer vision for identification and recognition. The spatial location of the fruits was obtained by means of stereovision, which is a technique consisting of two cameras viewing the scene from two different positions and then through triangulation, the real-world coordinates of the tomatoes were extracted. Using this information, the robotic arm was able to pluck and store the tomatoes. The AGV, on the other hand, was used to transport the robotic arm throughout the greenhouse and line following was employed so that the vehicle achieved an autonomous behaviour. The time for the robotic arm to harvest and store one tomato was approximately ten seconds, but this slow speed was compensated by the system's ability to work for four hours straight and multiple shifts after charging. © 2022 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.","Automated Guided Vehicle; Autonomous; Computer vision; Line following; Robotic arm; Stereovision","Food supply; Harvesting; Machine design; Mobile robots; Robot vision; Robotic arms; Automated guided vehicles; Autonomous; External sources; Food security; Harvesting robot; Island state; Line following; Small island; Small-and-medium enterprise; Stereovision; Fruits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137435705

Nevertheless, workflow scheduling is a challenging task because of the dependency among its tasks, high computational intensity, and heterogeneous behavior of resources. Execution time and trust for virtual machines on which the tasks are to be scheduled is the most difficult job during resource allocation and raises considerable problems. Thus, management of reducing of Makespan time and allocation of tasks to the virtual machine having the highest trust value at the same time is necessary. It becomes a multi-objective problem. Regarding the current issue, we address a multi-objective function of trust and the execution time for the selection of virtual machines for the allocation of workflow tasks. We have proposed MOGAACO, a multi-objective function-based approach using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for scheduling workflows. For the generation of initial pheromone, ACO invokes GA. With the designed multi-objective function three parameters are evaluated, Load Balance Level (LBL), Makespan, Resource Utilization (RU).

It aids in proliferating information and data sources, improving software's data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is changing the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly dependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer and meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and which channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users feel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools can also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor's campaigns and reveal their customers' expectations. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being explicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns and improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant articles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then these articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI in marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for marketing sectors are examined. Finally, critical applications of AI for marketing are recognised and analysed. © 2022 The Author(s)","Applications; Artificial intelligence (AI); Customer; Data analysis; Decision; Marketing",,Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137403442

Drilling and well engineering cluster is a key player in operating cost optimization which requires digestion and analysis of tons of data generated through daily operational reports. Thus, several digitalization projects have been initiated to optimize drilling and well process to be better, faster, and safer. In this paper, we intend to share a successful journey of digitalization under drilling and well cluster. The transformation journey started with identifying engineer's pain points in each process, among which the most common were redundant processes, manual data inputs/calculations, and time spent on collecting and analyzing unstructured data sources. Moreover, diversified practices on engineering programs and data analysis adversely affect well design standardization and optimizations. To counter those pain points, digital transformation projects were ideated by using digital solutions and technology which are grouped in 5 focus areas: centralized data platform, business intelligence, robotic process automation, digital assistant, and data analytics from fundamental to advance level respectively. Besides out-of-the-box solutions, many internally developed systems have been utilized throughout the journey which helps engineers to build their digital capability and awareness. There are over twenty (20) drilling and well digital projects implemented since the transformation project has been started. And as a result, engineers' workload has been reduced significantly using digital solutions such as data extraction, visualization, and in-depth analysis. For example, the first successful project under robotic process automation utilizes text analytic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze well conditions and integrity status from unstructured data and to generate reports within a limited timeframe. Another successful case is well design automated workflow which saved around 40% planning cycle time and provides a better design quality which will lead to a lower well cost. Total cost saving of over 40 mm usd has been recorded so far under the digital transformation project. Furthermore, there is an outlook for additional cost-saving through future new projects, integration, and scaling up plans across the company's international assets. The results and outcomes are very promising to this point. We believe that these initiatives will help the company to improve productivity, benefits, agility, and move beyond business disruptions. Combination of drilling and well expertise with digital transformation solutions will significantly improve well design process, quality and operational efficiency which make industry stay competitive and resilient in the future. © 2022 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE).

IBN allows network operators to express an outcome or business objective without the low-level configurations necessary to program the network to achieve these demands. Existing research proposals for IBN introduce several systems to translate users intents into network infrastructure configurations. Despite the positive aspects of these proposals, they still suffer from many drawbacks. Some require users to learn a new intent definition language. Some others may lack the appropriate grammar to make these frameworks recognize the intent correctly. In this paper, we introduce a framework leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for network management from an operator utterances.

These regulations are generating continuous need of review and adaption across software used by business. Over the past years, usage of Machine Learning for businesses increased significantly. The increase of usage is giving significant advantages to the business with its capabilities of predicting the results, enables the business to prepare for the upcoming challenges. Core principle on which Machine Learning is based on is 'Predictions are more accurate when the models can be trainable on huge amounts of data from various sources'. However, the need of processing large amounts of data is also bringing in a concern in terms of Data Privacy. With this paper, we will provide a risk-based approach, following the privacy focused threat modeling to ensure data privacy compliant machine learning lifecycle. Risk based approach advocates 'Start Early' to identify potential risk early to plan and mitigate. We will describe in this paper, how risk-based approach can systematically help identifying usage of personal data, data minimization and flow and process implementation required to ensure the machine learning business case is meeting the data privacy regulatory requirement. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Minimization; Data Privacy; Machine Learning; Personal Data; Personally Identifiable Information; Risk Assessment; Threat Modeling","Life cycle; Machine learning; Privacy-preserving techniques; Compliant machines; Data minimizations; Large amounts of data; Machine-learning; Personally identifiable information; Potential risks; Regulatory requirements; Risk-based approach; Risks assessments; Threat modeling; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137274258

The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to exceed 7.4 billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to perform 65×1012 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are developed and used. This motivated our work on a new DL-based architecture for indoor localization that is more energy efficient compared to related state-of-the-art approaches while showing only marginal performance degradation. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the proposed model produces only 58% of the carbon footprint while maintaining 98.7% of the overall performance compared to state of the art model external to our group. Additionally, we elaborate on a methodology to calculate the complexity of the DL model and thus the CO2 footprint during its training and operation. © 2022 IEEE.","carbon footprint; energy efficiency; fingerprinting; green communications; localization; neural network (NN); wireless, deep learning (DL)","Complex networks; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Indoor positioning systems; Location based services; Telecommunication services; End-users; Energy efficient; Fingerprinting; Green communications; Localisation; Location-based services; Neural network; Neural-networks; Wireless fingerprinting; Wireless, deep learning; Carbon footprint",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137268618

Choosing an appropriate DBMS system in a computer application, though, was never completely arbitrary, based on the professional study. Developing a viable answer for such a challenge depending on business goals and needs from judgment necessitates a thorough study on information access as well as comprehensive professional evaluation. The research presents a DSS to help non-kinetics discover their proper DBMS solutions and otherwise information retention types faster. This suggested DSS is unique in that it uses MoSCoW to evaluate criterion weighting or deliberate, as well as assessment frameworks for quantifying overall levels of quasi criterion and ISO/IEC qualitative features to show the link between criterion based upon industry specialists' expertise. Companies that produce programs have difficulty integrating new innovations, such as Internet computing or information management platforms, into their operations. Because computer engineers and top programmers are usually specialists in their field, users need to consult or train other professionals. Therefore, computer development is an appropriate area for implementing judgment support technologies that can proactively help this prediction to choose the best technologies for their products. We offer a decision support system (DSS) to assist in the selection of the best appropriate information architecture. According to both example reports and specialists, this technique improves visibility into the choice method gives a deeper prioritized choice range than if customers have conducted their study individually, or saves the duration and expense of the judicial procedure. © 2022 George Chellin Chandran et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Database systems; Digital storage; Information management; Soft computing; Built-in calibration; Business goals; Business needs; Calibration standard; Data storage systems; Information access; Information retention; Softcomputing techniques; Standards support; Structured data; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137215680

It has been widely used in takeout, data labeling, organizing activities, security and artificial intelligence. Currently, many manufacturers wish to explore SC in maintenance business, as SC can reduce maintenance time, reduce labor costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In maintenance business scenarios, there are two kinds of cooperated participators. One is freedom workers who are sensitive to distance, and the other is employed by manufacturers who are insensitive to distance. Therefore, some methods of SC with one type worker are challenging to apply to maintenance business scenarios directly. To match this scenario, we model the maintenance scenario and prove that this scenario is an NP-hard problem; then, both greedy and Nash equilibrium methods are proposed to complete the tasks for making a high total reward. The greedy algorithm (GA) first assigns the nearest available workers to each task, and the employee will try to join the task to help GM to complete more tasks, on the condition that the task cannot be completed and reaches a particular proportion. The Nash equilibrium algorithm (NA) is used to find a Nash equilibrium for all the workers and employees. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the synthetic data set of gMission in small and large data sets. The finished task number of NA is about 5% more than that of GA, and the reward of NA is about 10% more than that of GA. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","cooperated; greedy algorithm; maintenance business; Nash equilibrium algorithm; spatial crowdsourcing","Computational complexity; Crowdsourcing; Customer satisfaction; Game theory; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Wages; Business scenario; Cooperated; Equilibrium algorithm; Greedy algorithms; Maintenance business; Nash equilibria; Nash equilibrium algorithm; Optimisations; Spatial crowdsourcing; Workers'; Maintenance",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137185990

However, key engineers with years of experience are approaching retirement, leaving a knowledge chasm. Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) be trained to capture and learn this expertise to help advise and augment the knowledge of junior engineers? A cross-functional team of scientists, manufacturing experts, and engineers produce Piping Specifications for ABB clients' new and existing projects. They are based on deep technical expertise which engineers have built over four decades of client engagements. Our AI solution unlocks and ingests this knowledge into a relational database. It uses an unsupervised association machine learning model (MLM) to understand what pipes and components were used in previous specifications based on various attributes. Given the constraints (i.e., fluid type, material, temperature, etc.), the engineer is presented with several recommendations detailing pipe configurations (i.e., the pipe standard, thickness, flanges, reducers, etc.) that have been most used in similar settings. The MLM is inherently interpretable following Explainable AI and the recommendations are presented in a human-centric, evidence-based web application which is hosted on an open hybrid multi-cloud platform. The AI solution supports ABB to capture and curate the wealth of knowledge that has been developed over several decades. This allows ABB to maintain and expand the piping specification offering with reduced costs while augmenting many future engineers. This solution is problem agnostic and has been built in a flexible and reusable manner, applicable to any industry where knowledge retention brings a crucial competitive advantage. © 2022 IISE Annual Conference and Expo 2022.

A major goal in the selection of characteristics is to produce predictions about skin disease instances in connection with influencing variables, which is one of the most important tasks. As a consequence of the widespread usage of sensors, the amount of data collected in the health industry is disproportionately large when compared to data collected in other sectors. In the past, researchers have used a variety of machine learning algorithms to determine the relationship between illnesses and other disorders. Forecasting is a procedure that involves many steps, the most important of which are the preprocessing of any scenario and the selection of forecasting features. A major disadvantage of doing business in the health industry is a lack of data availability, which is particularly problematic when data is provided in an unstructured format. Filling in missing numbers and converting between various types of data take somewhat more than 70% of the total time. When dealing with missing data in machine learning applications, the mean, average, and median, as well as the stand mechanism, may all be employed to solve the problem. Previous research has shown that the characteristics chosen for a model's overall performance may have an influence on the overall performance of the model's overall performance. One of the primary goals of this study is to develop an intelligent algorithm for identifying relevant traits in models while simultaneously eliminating nonsignificant attributes that have an impact on model performance. To present a full view of the data, artificial intelligence techniques such as SVM, decision tree, and logistic regression models were used in conjunction with three separate feature combination methodologies, each of which was developed independently. As a consequence of this, their accuracy, F-measure, and precision are all raised by a factor of ten, respectively. We then have a list of the most important features, together with the weights that have been allocated to each of them. © 2022 Mohammed J.

The biggest challenge for agriculture is how to make optimal use of agricultural machinery and manage the work of the staff. The entire management of a farm can be simplified and facilitated by a telemetry system, otherwise known as a remote monitoring system, for a machine or implement. The analysis of the data obtained by this system provides an opportunity to optimize the business processes. Studies have shown that the use of automatic navigation systems allows the choice of appropriate driving strategies and the avoidance of tillage overlaps or uncultivated areas. Based on the experience of agricultural professionals, the processing of data recorded and stored in the telemetry system is encountered. The main question is how to correctly interpret, analyse and in the future use the information obtained from the yield, fertilization, spraying, soil agrochemical properties maps for making final decisions. For the study, the harvest data collected and stored in the telemetry system of the Claas Lexion combine were selected. The aim of the work is to analyse the winter wheat, spring barley, canola, oats, corn, and beans crop harvest data and show the combine harvester efficiency increasement possibilities. The structural analysis of the collected working time data of the combine harvester was performed by the methods of mathematical statistics. As the telemetry system shows, the grain unloading takes in average 2 minutes. According to these data it could be said that a grain tank unloading during combine run for a 2 min, with average yield of 7 t ha-1 could increase the combine performance by 15%. At the same time, the 2 min drive during grain tank unloading would increase the harvested area by 3.4%. © 2022 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Modern processes are often highly complex, data-driven, and knowledge-intensive. In such processes, it is not sufficient to focus on data storage/analysis; and the knowledge workers will need to collect, understand, and relate the big data (from open, private, social, and IoT data islands) to process analysis. Today, the advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science can transform business processes in fundamental ways; by assisting knowledge workers in communicating analysis findings, supporting evidence, and making decisions. This tutorial gives an overview of services in organizations, businesses, and society. We introduce notions of Data Lake as a Service and Knowledge Lake as a Service and discuss their role in analyzing data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes in the age of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. We introduce the novel notion of AI-enabled Processes and discuss methods for building intelligent Data Lakes and Knowledge Lakes as the foundation for Process Automation and Cognitive Augmentation in Business Process Management.

Ideally, decision makers could quickly create tailored decision support systems (DSS) themselves which optimally address their individual requirements for decision support. Although service-oriented architectures have been proposed for DSS customization, they are primarily targeting trained software developers and cannot immediately be adapted by decision makers or domain experts with little to no software development knowledge. In this paper, we therefore motivate an assisted process-based service composition approach which can be used by non-developers to create tailored DSS. For assistance during service composition, we contribute a meta-model for the formalization of both decision support requirements and functionality of decision support services. Models created according to the meta-model can be used to detect mismatches between a decision maker’s requirements for decision support and services selected in the service composition representing a DSS. Furthermore, the formalizations may even be used for automated service composition given a decision maker’s decision support requirements. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our meta-model in the domain of regional energy distribution network planning. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Automated service composition; Decision support system generator; End-user programming; Service-oriented DSS","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Software design; Automated service composition; Decision makers; Decision support system generator; Decision supports; End-user programming; End-users; Service Oriented; Service-oriented decision support system; Services composition; System Generator; Information services",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137038935

In many cases, such delays cause environmental issues and affect commuters, local businesses, project cost, and the public and workers' health and safety. There is a growing need to identify and study the relative significance of the major causes of delays in wastewater pipeline construction projects in the KSA. A questionnaire survey was conducted to assess the importance of 30 potential delay causes based on the perceptions of a select sample of clients, consultants, and contractors. These 30 potential delay factors corresponded to eight main delay categories. The survey data was analyzed using the relative importance index and was then further examined for agreement between the three groups. The top five delay causes identified were labor supply, equipment availability and failure, unforeseen ground conditions, labor productivity, and improper planning. The analysis showed disagreements between clients and contractors as well as between consultants and contractors with regard to the rankings of both individual delay causes and factor categories. The results of this survey will be used in future work to develop decision support systems for wastewater pipeline construction projects. It is anticipated that altogether these studies will contribute to improving the sustainability of wastewater pipeline construction projects in the future. © 2022 Pipelines 2022: Planning and Design - Proceedings of Sessions of the Pipelines 2022 Conference.

The distribution network substation needs to obtain distribution network operation data configuration through communication network. The reliability of communication network directly affects the protection performance. Therefore, there is a need to establish a communication network that is reliable and meet protection performance requirements. In order to improve the engineering application of distribution network communication operation and maintenance platform, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the data quality of the distribution network communication operation and maintenance platform. Based on the construction background of smart distribution network, this paper studies the architecture of distribution network communication operation and maintenance platform. Starting from the requirements of information interconnection, intercommunication, interoperability and plug-and-play, the description specification of distribution network communication operation is established according to the principle of artificial intelligence data analysis. The unified modeling of protection and control system is realized. By analyzing the business composition of regional protection and self-healing control system of distribution network, the size of network information flow is quantitatively evaluated, which provides a basis for the engineering application of regional protection and self-healing control system of the distribution network. Experimental analysis shows that compared with the traditional method, the comprehensive performance of this method is improved by 10%. The partial performance is improved by 40%, which can support the master-slave regional protection and control business system. © 2022 SPIE.","Artificial intelligence; data analysis; Flow model; Operational platform; Power distribution network","Artificial intelligence; Control systems; Data communication systems; Data handling; Maintenance; Self-healing materials; Telecommunication networks; Communication operation; Communications networks; Flow modelling; Intelligence data analysis; Network communications; Operational platforms; Operations and maintenance; Power distribution network; Protection performance; Regional protection; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136961585

Vehicles run for a long time (up to thirty years) so that about one-third of lifecycle costs are caused by maintenance. Condition-based predictive maintenance strategies offer economic improvements of up to 15 percent and an increased availability of up to 100 percent. By implementing a sensor based diagnostic system using artificial intelligence techniques and business analytics, maintenance can be optimized. This paper presents a concept for the detection of faulty mechanical components, such as dampers and springs, of railway bogies. On the one hand, the work deals with the analysis of time series data by evaluating power spectral density and transfer functions. On the other hand, it shows results of the training of machine learning models based on features. Various multi body simulations have been done to develop a physical understanding of the effects of the individual fault modes. Beside this, the available data set for the analysis also includes real measured data from test rides with faulty components. The developed algorithms have been deployed on a Siemens commuter train. In addition to validation results, this work also shows an example of the successful detection of real failures in operational mode. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bogie diagnostics; Fault detection; Machine learning; Probabilistic reasoning","Condition based maintenance; Machine learning; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Spectral density; Statistical tests; Time series analysis; Bayesian nets; Bogie diagnostic; Condition; Faults detection; Lifecycle costs; Machine-learning; Probabilistic reasoning; Railway bogie; Reasoning approach; Time-periods; Fault detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136948844

Unfortunately, predicting this deterioration can be a highly intricate and uncertain endeavor. The main culprit for this inherent complexity is the fact that a water main wear rate depends on its physical and structural characteristics but also on environmental and operational factors. In nearly all cases, the number of possible parameter combinations makes highly vulnerable pipes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find with a manual approach. Furthermore, many studies have shown that modeling a group of pipes, or cohorts, which share similar characteristics improves the prediction of a distribution network's deterioration. A more computational and data-driven solution seems to represent the best way to extract this valuable information efficiently. Artificial intelligence and unsupervised learning algorithms possess the advantage to identify the pipe cohorts that are most at risk of failure and the conditions under which network failures occur from historical data. Once these vulnerable groups are identified, it allows utility managers (1) to have a better understanding of the network's degradation over time, (2) to tailor inspection plans and replacement programs, and (3) to optimize water main investments in order to provide an improved level of service. The Region of Peel (Canada) has made investments in the past to collect good quality data for water main breaks and associated factors. And as such, the Region of Peel is faced with the increasing challenge of water main breaks and the resulting disruption to Peel residents and businesses and, in an attempt to meet council-approved service levels, the Region intends to use innovative methods to plan and optimize strategic investment in the water distribution network. Staff plans to use this predictive modeling information to plan water main inspection and replacement programs and optimize investments in the water main replacement program. © Pipelines 2022: Planning and Design - Proceedings of Sessions of the Pipelines 2022 Conference.",,"Deterioration; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Managers; Pipelines; Water distribution systems; Infrastructure investment; Inherent complexity; Machine learning techniques; Medium term; Network degradations; Pipe failures; Replacement projects; Water distribution networks; Water mains; Water utility managers; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136829503

Compared with general documents, invoices are highly structured and usually with complex layouts like tables and text boxes, which makes typical Natural Language Processing models less effective when processing the plain texts that are directly converted from the original invoices. To address this issue, many approaches adopted Graph-based Networks to propagate node embeddings along with revealing latent connections between tokens or text fragments. In this work, we focused on the task of extracting data points from invoices as a sub-task of Information Extraction (IE), where the data point extraction is modelled as a node-level classification approach. We also proposed the Stacked Propagation Network to facilitate the propagation of node embeddings according to different edge maps, based on Graph Attention Network (GAT). In addition, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is adopted to improve the performance of data point extraction. Extensive experiments have been performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, on a real-world dataset. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the influences brought by each component. © 2022 IEEE.","Data Points; Document Analysis; Graph Attention Network; Information Extraction; Named Entity Recognition","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Embeddings; Graph theory; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Network layers; Office automation; Bank statements; Business documents; Datapoints; Documents analysis; Embeddings; Graph attention network; Information extraction; Multi-layer graphs; Named entity recognition; Point extraction; Graphic methods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136671118

Aforementioned driving factors resulted in adoption of a number of innovative technologies, and no other trend has had a greater impact in recent years than Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is a comprehensive term that encompasses data management, manufacturing competitiveness, manufacturing processes, and efficiency. The term ""Industry 4.0""refers to a group of key enabler technologies, such as cyber physical models, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics, including embedded devices which are all significant components to the mechanized and digitized industrial environments. AI approaches have been used for water treatment processes as well as desalination in recent years for optimizing the process along with providing realistic answers to water scarcity and water pollution-related issues. AI applications have been used to predict and minimize water treatment process operational costs by lowering costs and optimizing chemical utilization. Several AI models are successful and accurate in predicting effectiveness of various adsorbents used in the removal process of a variety of contaminants from water. To identify the current level of research and future development prospects of smart manufacturing, this study uses a comprehensive literature review technique for manufacturing sustainability of nanocomposite fabrication for water treatment applications. The model provided will help to create a baseline for AI and hybrid models in the water treatment and wastewater management sectors, allowing for the increased performance and innovative growth. It will serve to provide the framework and give guidance for researchers interested in creating superior nanocomposites for waste and fresh water treatment and management using Industry 4.0. This study looks at a variety of AI approaches as well as how they may be used in water treatment, with an emphasis on pollutant adsorption.

This technology allows us to learn historical data and generate patterns from the precedent data. In oil and gas companies, large amounts of data are produced every day. Many accurate decisions in this type of company are made from the data. Cilon Indonesia (CI) Co. Ltd. is one of the oil and gas companies currently operating the largest oil field in Indonesia. This type of company's operation and financial profit depends on oil price, which is affected by global oil supply and demand. If oil prices fall suddenly, all oil and gas companies need to run their businesses more efficiently and effectively. There are many ways to make this kind of company run their business effectively and efficiently by implementing several strategies such as capital cost efficiency, operational cost efficiency and even laying off some employees. One of the major costs in operation in oil and gas companies is the cost for well workover. This well workover does not always produce oil gain. In fact, even it is resulting in oil gain, but not all well workover programs are economical whenever the oil price is low. This condition makes Petroleum Engineer (PE) need to select the best well workover for certain wells. Well candidates for workover are usually selected manually using data from many resources, reports and information. Well candidates are reviewed one by one, and with several criteria, the well is proposed to a certain type of well workover. This research explains how this company improves their selection of well candidates for the most economic workover called Short Cyclic Steam Stimulation (SCSS). The process improvement is done using the hybrid method: lean six sigma method and big data analytics method, which utilize ANNs to predict the oil after workover executed. The result demonstrates how this hybrid method can improve the process with a sustainable solution. Its successful improvement in PE time selects SCSS well candidates from 2 hours to 10 minutes to generate 20 wells per day. Its also improve the success rate of SCSS workover from 61% to 73%. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.","Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Big data analytics; Cyclic steam injection; Dmaic; Hybrid method; Information technology; Lean; Machine learning; Oil and gas company; Short cyclic steam stimulation; Six sigma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136519478

The industrial revolution has developed international trade, labor relations, and legal structures and brought about radical innovations not only in engineering sciences but also in social and health sciences (Özsoylu, 2017). Until the time we live in, four major industrial revolutions have taken place. Industrially, the first industrial revolution (Industry 1.0), which started with the invention of the steam engine in the 18th century and aimed to increase production, was followed by the second industrial revolution (Industry 2.0), which emerged as a transition to mass production at the beginning of the 20th century and started to benefit from electrical energy. Later, the third industrial revolution (Industry 3.0) emerged, where production systems ceased to be analog and digital systems took part in industry. Recently, a new industrial revolution has been mentioned. This period, which was put forward under the leadership of Germany and triggered by cyber physical system (CPS)-based production and service innovation, includes the autonomous management of industrial products or systems with more software and intuitive intelligence (Yildiz, 2018). The radical changes created by software and information systems in the business processes that produce goods and services started the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). The new needs arising from the fourth industrial revolution made it compulsory for enterprises to renew themselves, to adopt new working and production techniques, and to apply modern business and personnel principles. As a result of technological and scientific developments, the work has undergone significant changes in terms of form, quality and quantity, causing the emergence of new jobs and working areas, and the need for personnel with different qualifications in these areas. In addition, enterprises have made great efforts to adapt their personnel to changing environmental conditions. Therefore, contemporary management and contemporary management concepts have gained great importance (Saldamli, 2008). In this context, managers in the field of human resources management aim to train employees with technology and digital competence and problem-solving skills. New recruits are also expected to have the skills to use computer/technology, and develop and apply digital solutions (Sorko et al., 2016). As stated above, the informatics and technological changes that have developed with Industry 4.0 have significantly affected the management and business methods of enterprises. Today’s businesses are aware that traditional methods used to keep up with this change are no longer sufficient, and that complex business processes and functions can only be managed using technology. Alongside the rapid developments in information technologies, in the digitalizing world, human resources management approaches have also started to adapt to digital transformation. Hence, nowadays companies use digital human resources systems while performing their human resources functions. In this way, the capability to carry out activities far faster, dynamically and on a global scale in electronic processes enables an institution to be part of a wider employment process (Bayarçelik, 2020). Artificial intelligence robots conducting interviews, the use of chatbots, transferring payroll, leave and personal information to the digital environment, conducting training online, using QR codes in job applications, transferring all HR functions to mobile applications and tracking on there, online performance measurement and instant feedback, and making career plans digitally are among the digital technologies used in the field of human resources management. Digitalization has many advantages for businesses in terms of human resources applications. The first of these is that it provides cost savings. Achieving savings on paper, etc., in the virtue of digitalizing HR applications, reduces the costs of businesses. Another advantage is that it saves time. With digital applications, transactions can be performed much faster than the time spent for manual transactions. Finally, digital applications allow businesses to work more flexibly (Kiliç Kirilmaz, 2020). In this section, the concept of digital human resources management, and digital human resources management processes and technologies used in the human resources management process will be discussed. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","digital human resources management; Digitalization; human resources",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136377905

They exhibit the traditional features of emerging high-tech businesses: academia is the source of knowledge, born global, plenty of startups are emerging, competition is fragmented, the ecosystem has to be put in place, and rules of the game need to be written. The Chinese authorities have a clear mindset about the future technological trajectory of those domains: they are the conductor; they show the way. But political leaders fully entrusted to the performers, that is, to the market, the upcoming of those industries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Born global; Emerging sectors; Fragmented industries; Knowledge-driven; Market forces; Top-down",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136290643

The problem that arises is the lack of understanding of knowledge quality properties, which leads to the development of inefficient knowledge-intensive systems. But knowledge cannot be shared effectively without effective knowledge-intensive systems. Given this situation, the authors must analyze the benefits and believe that machine learning can benefit knowledge management and that machine learning algorithms can further improve knowledge-intensive systems. It also shows that machine learning is very helpful from a practical point of view. Machine learning not only improves knowledge-intensive systems but has powerful theoretical and practical implementations that can open up new areas of research. The objective set out is the comprehensive and systematic literature review of research published between 2018 and 2022, these studies were extracted from several critically important academic sources, with a total of 73 short articles selected.

Because promotion is one of the critical marketing decisions, referred to as one of 4P (i.e., Product, Pricing, Promotion, and Place) in marketing, it has been an important application area of AI in business. Copywriting is an essential catalyst in bridging customers and products to deliver a compelling promotion message to customers. It is a challenge for marketing managers to obtain copywriting efficiently and effectively to seize a market opportunity because they often suffer iterative discussion problems and difficulty choosing among multiple copywriting contents. Therefore, an automatic copywriting generator implemented by AI may become a feasible approach for training marketing personnel and assisting managers in marketing decision-making. The purpose of this research is to study the effectiveness of applying AI in copywriting generation for the learning of marketing personnel. This research develops character-based recurrent neural networks to generate marketing copywriting automatically and examines its effectiveness compared with award-winning copywriting by surveying marketing managers.

This study aimed to develop a deep learning approach for identifying oral lichen planus lesions using photographic images. Material and methods: Anonymous retrospective photographic images of buccal mucosa with 65 healthy and 72 oral lichen planus lesions were identified using the CranioCatch program (CranioCatch, Eskişehir, Turkey). All images were re-checked and verified by Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Radiology experts. This data set was divided into training (n = 51; n = 58), verification (n = 7; n = 7), and test (n = 7; n = 7) sets for healthy mucosa and mucosa with the oral lichen planus lesion, respectively. In the study, an artificial intelligence model was developed using Google Inception V3 architecture implemented with Tensorflow, which is a deep learning approach. Results: AI deep learning model provided the classification of all test images for both healthy and diseased mucosa with a 100% success rate. Conclusion: In the healthcare business, AI offers a wide range of uses and applications. The increased effort increased complexity of the job, and probable doctor fatigue may jeopardize diagnostic abilities and results. Artificial intelligence (AI) components in imaging equipment would lessen this effort and increase efficiency. They can also detect oral lesions and have access to more data than their human counterparts. Our preliminary findings show that deep learning has the potential to handle this significant challenge. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Oral lichen planus",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136116700

However, as an emerging industry, users often need to spend a lot of time to choose travel services that match their needs because of the complex amount of relevant information. Under such circumstances, this paper studied the recommendation method in travel platform. First, the big data is used to extract user data. Secondly, the current online travel business recommendation for users has the problem of low accuracy. The reason is that the services provided are still in traditional recommendation algorithm. In this paper, the Bayesian network is used to evaluate the user's attribute preference and generate a data model, using effective methods in artificial intelligence algorithms to improve collaborative filtering algorithms and finally generate hybrid recommendation algorithms. Compared with the traditional recommendation method, the experimental results showed that the research can improve the recommendation accuracy of tourist attractions by 6.55%, increase the user's satisfaction for the platform, and enhance the visit rate and retention rate of the tourist attraction recommendation platform. © 2022 Laiyan Yun et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Collaborative filtering; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Informational technologies; Internet industries; Megadata; Mobile Internet; Recommendation algorithms; Recommendation methods; Tourism industry; Tourist attractions; Travel services; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136037639

The primary goal of the study was to develop and implement an online Community Vibrancy Dashboard that would assist planners, decision makers, business leaders, and residents in defining, reviewing, and tracking community vibrancy. The study was supported by the Michigan Office of the Great Lakes under the 2016 Michigan Water Strategy and funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Four coastal communities in Michigan – Alpena, Manistee, Port Huron, and Sault Ste. Marie – participated in the study. These communities were selected because of their long economic and cultural histories with the Great Lakes, all are similar in size, and all have conducted relatively recent water-related resource restoration projects and were willing to participate. This study demonstrates how community engagement can result in measurable social indicators of community vibrancy that focus on the use of and connectedness to water resources in the Great Lakes Region. The study resulted in an innovative online visualization toolkit that provides opportunities for public review of local water projects and their resultant contributions to community vibrancy.

It has strong nonlinear mapping ability and is the most prominent part to solve some nonlinear problems. In the traditional BP algorithm, the coincidence initialization of weights and thresholds is random, which reduces the efficiency of the algorithm on the one hand and affects the accuracy of the algorithm results on the other hand. In order to solve these problems, this paper studies an e-commerce cross-border logistics risk assessment model based on improved neural network. This model can help merchants engaged in cross-border e-commerce to select appropriate third-party settlement platforms, so as to reduce the cost of merchants in the process of capital settlement. The key information in BP neural network algorithm is stored in weights and thresholds, which is enough to prove the importance of weights and thresholds for the effective operation of the whole network. The e-commerce cross-border logistics risk assessment model based on improved neural network aims to solve the problem of low level of risk assessment and the bottleneck of logistics risk assessment.

Traditional inventory methods tend to be transformed based on the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology. In particular, changing the way inventories are recorded, through the evolution of ma-chine learning methods in contemporary logistics, improves industrial efficiency, reduces costs and promotes the long-term development of businesses. The introduction of systems banking on artificial intelligence allows for smarter and more efficient methods than the traditional warehouse inventory counting. This paper presents a new approach (content and architecture) being included in semantic logistics technologies for specific warehouses or distribution centres that stores a wide range of general or specialized machines. Warehouse staff should utilise a smart device to grab images of the stored items on the pallet racks. The images are automatically processed and associated with the database such that the inventory items are recognized and counted, resulting in achieving the goals of proper inventory counting and evaluating stored entries' existence. The proposed inventory counting system is expected to enhance physical inventory recording, thus contributing to the efficiency of the entire supply chain and collaborating with other components of Warehouse 4.0. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Efficiency; Learning systems; Semantics; Supply chains; Artificial intelligence technologies; Distribution centres; Economic development; Introduction of systems; Learning methods; Logistics technologies; Long-term development; New approaches; Reduce costs; Smart devices; Warehouses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135900441

Recently, the Artificial Intelligence [AI] technologies are influencing every facet of data science domain. This technology driven-competitive world creates a lot of difficulties for people working in the data science sector by developing a notion of abandoning the data scientist profession. On the other hand, the human expectations aren’t matching reality, followed by No Clear Benchmarking in Salary Pay-Outs, Mapping a Data Scientist’s Role to Business Goals, and finally, there is a lack of upskilling for Data Science Professionals. These are the causes for the job change in the individuals and as the competition increases, there is always a substitute, henceforth the job security also falls in this competitive market. Different machine learning methods are used to figure out or to forecast the job change for the employees in the firm. This can be observed by the HR and give additional rewards for employee since the employee is an important asset to the company and its development.

This was seen as a problem because the SME sector forms the foundation for economic growth and the adoption of AI in this sector could enhance its ability to compete on a global stage. Hence the purpose of this research is to understand this lack of adoption. This qualitative study follows an interpretive philosophy and an inductive approach. Seven medium sized companies were selected across a variety of industry sectors and executives from each company were interviewed. The findings reveal that even though the participants generally have a clear understanding of the benefits of AI adoption and can articulate use cases, there are inhibiting factors preventing adoption. Primary among these inhibiting factors is the fear of losing control of critical business processes to a machine-based algorithm and the perceived lack of IT maturity to adopt and manage these AI tools. The value of these findings is that they provide an understanding of the barriers to AI adoption as well us highlighting the South African characteristic of reliance on informal networks to guide adoption decisions. © 2022, EasyChair.

New technologies like the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are projected to accelerate this trend by allowing farmers to use more robots and artificial intelligence. This is encapsulated by the Big Data phenomena, which refers to large amounts of data of varying types that may be acquired, evaluated, and used for judgement. The goal of this review is to get an understanding of the current state of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and to identify the corresponding socio-economic concerns that must be solved. A conceptual model for analysis was constructed using a structured approach which can also be used for further studies on this issue. The analysis reveals that Big Data applications in Smart Farming have an impact on the entire food supply chain, in addition to primary production. Big data is being used in farming operations to give predictive insights, drive real-time operational choices, and rethink business processes in order to create game-changing business models. As a result, several experts believe that Big Data will result in significant adjustments in the roles and power relationships among various players in today’s food supply chain operations.

Data incompatibilities may be introduced during the design or execution of such a process-driven DSS, e.g., when a service always generates or a decision maker selects data which violates a data constraint of a subsequent service. These incompatibilities cause interrupted or erroneous decision processes.

Through the combination of consumer choice and matching principle, the goal of this paper is to investigate the prospective implications of artificial intelligence systems on businesses' outcomes. From an entrepreneurship standpoint, the research revealed that artificial intelligence systems can help with better decision-making. What impact does the introduction of AI-based decision-making technologies have on organizational policymaking? The quirks of human and AI-based policymaking are identified in this research based on five important contextual factors: precision of the choice search area, contribution to the innovation of the policymaking process and result, volume of the replacement collection, policymaking pace, and generalizability. We create a novel paradigm comparative analysis of conventional and automation judgment along these criteria, demonstrating how both judgment modalities can be used to improve organizational judgment efficiency. Furthermore, the research shows that, by involving internal stakeholders, they can manage the correlation among AI technologies and improve decision for businessmen. Furthermore, the research shows that customer preferences and industry norms can moderate the link between AI systems and superior entrepreneurial judgment. The goal of this work is to conduct a thorough literature analysis examining the confluence of AI and marketing philosophy, as well as construct a theoretical model that incorporates concerns based on established studies in the areas. This research shows that, in a setting with artificial intelligence systems, customer expectation, industry standards, and participative management, entrepreneurial strategic decisions are enhanced. This research provides entrepreneurs with technology means for enhancing decision-making, illustrating the limitless possibilities given by AI systems. A conceptual approach is also formed, which discusses the four factors of profit maximization: relationship of AI tools and IT with corporate objectives; AI, organizational learning, and decision-making methodology; and AI, service development, and value. This study proposes a way to exploit this innovative innovation without destroying society. We show real-world examples of each of these frameworks, indicate circumstances in which they are likely to improve decision-making performance in organizations, and provide actionable implications into their constraints.

So, they are also known as driverless or robotic vehicles. Despite the name or group or size of vehicles, the purpose behind the technology is same. Besides the rapid development in technology of autonomous vehicles, the experiments have been started in early 1920 and due to lack of highly powerful computing devices, they were just controlled by radio wave technologies popularly known as remotes. Then, later on, the research and development took its speed in 1950 with the development of computers. But, nowadays with the development of highly powerful and cost-efficient computing hardware GPU the enhancement in technology becomes so rapid that it is updating day by day and becoming capable of concurring every aspect of human drivers’ skills. AI and Machine Learning algorithms are being developed to train the model for autonomous driving over huge amount of recorded driving data of human drivers. As the time goes on these models started mimicking drivers’ behavior and improves it day by day. So, as these Autonomous driving getting normalize and passing various parameters for driving the automobile industries saw a large potential for business and profit in autonomous vehicles leading the giant companies (Waymo Google, Tesla, Volvo, Renault, Uber, Toyota, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, General Motors, Bosch and Continental's motors) started developing Level-3 Autonomous vehicles and released in 2020.

One such process is disaster recovery (DR) planning to ensure business continuity in an adverse event. Over the past decade, computing power has grown tremendously. At the same time, AI has also grown, making it possible to have complex real-time analytics, which was previously difficult, making time-sensitive applications such as DR management possible. AI can automate the disaster recovery processes and ensure a quick initiation of the disaster recovery plan in case of an adverse event by shifting the critical operations to a secondary site, issuing automatic alerts to the corresponding administrator, and providing insights to deal with the situation. Consequently, using AI to implement a DR plan can be a practical move. Utilizing AI instead of manual processes to initiate the DR plan ensures faster initiation, reliability, and availability. This paper discusses the possible use cases for utilizing AI in DR workflow to ensure business continuity. Moreover, possible use cases for three phases of disaster recovery workflow, pre-disaster, implementation, and the aftermath, will be discussed. Furthermore, potential benefits and challenges of utilizing AI in the disaster management workflow will be highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Backup; Business continuity; Disaster recovery; Downtime","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Recovery; Adverse events; Backup; Business continuity; Computing power; Disaster recovery; Disaster recovery plan; Downtime; Real-time analytics; Recovery planning; Work-flows; Artificial intelligence",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135536174

In the 5G networks with collaborative computing enabled in cloud-edge-end nodes, how to reasonably decompose a complex power system inspection service into multiple task clusters becomes a prerequisite for the efficient distributed deployment of the service and its rapid execution. This paper proposes an approach for the decomposition of intelligent power system inspection services. It considers the computing resource requirements of the functional components in a power system inspection service as well as the interactions between them, perceives the computing capabilities of heterogeneous nodes, such as cloud, edge, and collaborative end terminal in 5G networks, and decomposes the service into multiple task clusters which retain the original logical structure.

Metal commodities are irreplaceable for the industry of developed countries, and their shortage in the covid times also increases the price and consequently the price of products made from them. As copper ore stocks continue to decline, suitable substitutes should be sought. The paper discusses the potential of copper substitution by aluminium and subsequently the development of prices and production of copper and aluminium, including a prediction about the future development. Research data were obtained from Market. business insider (2021) and Investing.com (2022) converted to time series. The price is shown in US dollars per tonne and the production value in millions of tonnes. Development data were processed using artificial intelligence and recurrent neural networks, including the Long Short Term Memory layer. Neural networks, as such, have great potential to predict these types of time series. The annual copper and aluminium production data were processed using a regression function. Neural networks could not be used due to the smaller data range. The results show that the 1NN30L neural network with an LSTM layer and considered a 30-day delay is the most suitable network for forecasting future copper prices, and the 3NN30L neural network with an LSTM layer and considered a 30-day delay is the most suitable network for forecasting future aluminium prices. The forecast has confirmed that the price of copper will fall at the end of 2021, and the trend will be constant in the next planned period. Aluminium will also fall sharply at the end of 2021; at the beginning of 2022, the price level is predicted to rise to that of 30 October 2021, and thereinafter the trend will be almost constant. Research has confirmed that copper and aluminium may be imperfect substitutes in some respect, but they can generally be considered complementary. Copper mining has stabilised in recent years, but aluminium production has increased significantly in the last decade, and it can be expected to grow in the near future. © 2022 by the authors.","aluminium price; Copper price; forecast; future development; neural networks; production; substitutes; time series",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135301476

With more adaptation, embracement, and development, we are witnessing a steady convergence and fusion of these technologies resulting in an unprecedented paradigm shift that is expected to disrupt and reshape the next generation systems in vertical domains in a way that the capabilities of the technologies are aligned in the best possible way to complement each other. Despite the fact that the convergence of the four technologies can potentially tackle the main shortcomings of existing systems, its adoption is still in its infancy phase, suffering from several issues, such as the absence of consensus towards any reference models or best practices.

Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new-age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.","Affective and cognitive trust; artificial intelligence; mHealth (mobile health) app; randomized field experiment; technology acceptance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135151436

ANNs are used in both deep learning and machine learning in nuclear medicine. Alternatively, if 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is used, the inputs may be the actual images that are being analyzed, rather than a set of inputs. In nuclear medicine, artificial intelligence reimagines and reengineers the field's therapeutic and scientific capabilities. Understanding the concepts of 3D CNN and U-Net in the context of nuclear medicine provides for a deeper engagement with clinical and research applications, as well as the ability to troubleshoot problems when they emerge. Business analytics, risk assessment, quality assurance, and basic classifications are all examples of simple ML applications. General nuclear medicine, SPECT, PET, MRI, and CT may benefit from more advanced DL applications for classification, detection, localization, segmentation, quantification, and radiomic feature extraction utilizing 3D CNNs. An ANN may be used to analyze a small dataset at the same time as traditional statistical methods, as well as bigger datasets. Nuclear medicine's clinical and research practices have been largely unaffected by the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI). Clinical and research landscapes have been fundamentally altered by the advent of 3D CNN and U-Net applications.

Can we, however, rely on big data blindly? What happens if the training data set of a machine learning module is incorrect and contains a statistical paradox? Data, like fossil fuels, is valuable, but it must be refined carefully for the best results. Statistical paradoxes are difficult to observe in datasets, but they are significant to analyse in every small or big dataset. In this paper, we discuss the role of statistical paradoxes on Big data. Mainly we discuss the impact of Berkson’s paradox and Simpson’s paradox on different types of data and demonstrate how they affect big data. We provide that statistical paradoxes are more common in a variety of data and they lead to wrong conclusions potentially with harmful consequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and a case study indicate that statistical paradoxes are severely harmful to big data and automatic data analysis techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data science; Explainable AI; Machine learning; Simpson’s paradox","Big data; Data Science; Fossil fuels; Statistics; Berkson; Business data; Case-studies; Explainable AI; Machine learning module; Machine-learning; Real-world datasets; Simpson; Simpson’s paradox; Training dataset; Machine learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135092196

Furthermore, the competition between the electronic companies is fiercer than ever. In this sense, product quality is a key point in the company’s business plan. Being the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) the main and most sensitive part of an electronic product, ensuring its quality is fundamental to the production process. Visual Inspection is one of the most important tools to ensure PCB quality in a manufacturing line. Considering the advances in computing systems, the Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) machines are replacing human operators in the visual inspection process. However, AOI machines usually still need highly trained operators, with knowledge of image processing, so there still has room for more automated processes using Artificial Intelligence, particularly considering the advances with Neural Networks. This is the subject of this paper, where it is presented a survey about the traditional techniques and neural networks techniques able to identify components and anomalies in various PCB types.

For most enterprises, new digital business models and participation in service eco-systems lead to severe changes of the enterprise architecture (EA) and the need for methodical support to systematically perform the resulting change process. The focus of this paper is on the implementation of AI applications in organizations. Based on the analysis of industrial case studies, our observation is that different kinds of AI applications require different prerequisites in an organizational IT landscape, some of which can be found in an EA model, and some enterprises intend to use AI but are not prepared for it. The work investigates, what information can be harvested from EA models to support requirements engineering and the evaluation of organizational readiness for AI planning and implementation. The main contributions of our work are (a) an enhanced and updated literature analysis on EA use for AI introduction, (b) an analysis of differences in requirements of different kinds of AI applications, and (c) an improved AI context analysis method prepared for addressing these differences. The improved method exploits insights gained in our work on what information regarding the requirements can be extracted from EA models. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AI context; AI requirements engineering; Artificial intelligence; Enterprise architecture; Organizational AI solutions","Artificial intelligence; Data Analytics; Metadata; AI applications; AI context; AI requirement engineering; Digital transformation; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise architecture modeling; Organisational; Organizational AI solution; Requirement engineering; Service ecosystems; Requirements engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135043474

The wide use of modern technologies of data processing “big data”, “artificial intelligence”, “internet of things” does not only open new opportunities for business and people but also makes more evident the gap between individual’s interests for control of his data processing and thus protecting its privacy and commercial use of data by Internet companies. The state, on the other hand, seeks to get a more wide and exclusive access to the data collected by business entities, trying to apply a renewed concept of data sovereignty using its citizens’ personal data protection as a legal ground. The author notes the growing desire from both the state and business entities to undermine individual’s right to control his data processing as an inherent right of a data subject in order to facilitate the access to them and guarantee their interests. Awareness by the state and business of the new opportunities given by processing metadata including personal data, as a fundamental resource for the digital economy development can potentially lead to the situation where an individual will no longer be able to participate in determining the key parameters of their use. Most recent changes in Russian legislation on open access personal data that are to come into force in 2021 also leave much ground for uncertainty. In fact, they can shift the balance even more towards the interests of big business and the state. © 2022, The Author(s).","Big data; Data sovereignty; Digital economy; Human rights; Personal data","Data privacy; Economics; Laws and legislation; Open Data; Business entities; Commercial use; Data sovereignty; Data subjects; Digital economy; Foreign countries; Human rights; Modern technologies; New tendencies; Personal data protections; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135034561

Yet, its adoption is often challenging, due to both a lack of financial resources as well as staff. Particularly small and mid-sized enterprises (SME) risk to be left behind. AutoML, an instrument that helps automate certain AI tasks and thus reduces the need for dedicated staff, promises to overcome some of these AI adoption challenges. Investigating this problem space, the given paper reports on the results of a study exploring AI strategies, initiatives and obstacles SMEs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland face, and how AutoML may help with them. Results from an interview study with representatives from 12 different manufacturing companies suggest that AutoML can facilitate AI adoption, especially to overcome limited data science expertise and to enable prototyping. In this, it may further support strategic decision-making and create awareness for AI-driven innovation.

Although the translation accuracy and overall situation of machine translation based on artificial intelligence are similar to that of human translation, the basic algorithm of machine translation is still a program that judges right and wrong through computer code. It cannot simulate the ""faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance""of human translation in combination with social background and human culture. However, for some mechanical operations, such as business translation, scenes with low requirements, such as common vocabulary in daily tourism, can still meet the needs. Therefore, under the influence of artificial intelligence machine translation, the relationship between the two is that machine translation can replace human translation in some aspects, but it cannot replace human translation. © 2022 Zhao Lihua.",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Machine translation; Program translators; Commercial applications; Computer codes; Google+; Human cultures; Machine translations; Mechanical operations; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134889378

Artificial intelligence methods are increasingly being implemented into finance from year to year. The research reveals the essence and concept of using artificial intelligence methods in general and in debt financing in particular. It is proposed to distinguish four criteria (context, data, model and tasks) in the concept of using artificial intelligence methods and to consider such usage through the prism of the life cycle of the artificial intelligence system. The list of tasks of artificial intelligence systems in debt financing is formed, and the main problem situations on debt financing management in which it is expedient to use artificial intelligence methods are identified. Since bonds are the primary tool for attracting debt financing in the stock market, and their scope requires the active implementation of digital technologies, the research clarified the algorithm for pricing bonds using artificial intelligence methods, which improves the interaction between lenders and borrowers. Particular attention is paid to identifying the benefits and risks of using artificial intelligence methods in debt financing and applying artificial intelligence methods in debt financing of business entities at different management levels. It is proved that in the conditions of total digitalization, the necessity of using modern information technologies, particularly methods of artificial intelligence, is necessary. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Artificial intelligence; business entities; debt financing; digitalization; economics; methods","Artificial intelligence; Life cycle; Artificial intelligence methods; Artificial intelligence systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; Business entities; Context data; Debt financing; Digital technologies; Digitalization; Management level; Method; Economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134783420

The key to corporate survival and development is to find the most profitable customer bases all over the world and develop products to meet their demands. Traditionally, market targeting relies on the decisions of a small number of senior managers in enterprises; however, due to novel and changing customer demands, the business environment has become increasingly complex. If previous traditional methods are adopted, enterprises may select the wrong markets, which can lead to complete destruction. Therefore, this study proposes a new market targeting method and replaces human decisions with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, in order to render market targeting more scientific and systematic, improve the quality of marketing decisions, maximize corporate profits, occupy the optimal market with limited resources, and achieve the goal of sustainable business. This study applied three AI algorithms, the naive Bayes algorithm, J48 algorithm, and OneR algorithm, for model training and analytical prediction of the testing datasets. According to the results, the model accuracies of the naive Bayes algorithm, J48 algorithm, and OneR algorithm are 100, 91.7, and 83.3%, respectively; the F-measures of the naive Bayes algorithm, J48 algorithm, and OneR algorithm are 1, 0.909, and 0.8, respectively, which indicates that the three algorithms have reliable predictions.

Traditional industrial and commercial management resource scheduling is highly reliant on manual labor. When confronted with the requirements of large-scale project management, the pure manual mode cannot track the real-time progress of the project flexibly, effectively, and in a timely manner, resulting in the inability to complete the corresponding resource-scheduling work efficiently, which will affect the overall operation progress of the project. Deep neural networks have a high-application potential for solving extremely complex and highly nonlinear optimization problems.

Combined with GPU technology, the deep learning framework can provide an extremely complex optimization problem with a practical and feasible optimization scheme and corresponding solution path in a very short amount of time. Therefore, this paper explores the potential application of deep learning technology to industrial and commercial resource-scheduling management.

A developing country like South Africa is expected to adopt AI especially in its e-commerce spaces. Notwithstanding the evidence that e-commerce is growing rapidly, South Africa's use of e-commerce is still growing with potential to grow further. This current study makes use of systematic review using snowballing approach. A total of 107 papers were searched and discovered for this study. These are papers related to e-commerce and AI fields. Iterations were applied to eliminate papers that were not relevant to this study. This was performed by using backward and forward snowballing. The paper also reviews the status of AI adoption in e-commerce and its application to the business landscape in South African context as well as the effectiveness on online shopping. The results of this review exercise show that South Africa has adopted Ai in-ecommerce over the past decades. However, it was further discovered that South Africa's e-commerce space is confronted with complex challenges and factors including the role played by the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analytics, ethical issues including privacy matters confronting e-commerce spaces. The role of government in the process is also notable as a factor and game changer in response to legislation and policy direction. The key outcome of the study shows that there is a need for a development of a framework for e-commerce in the context of South Africa. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Data Analytics; Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Internet of things; 'current; Data analytics; E- commerces; E-Commerce applications; Ethical issues; ITS applications; Online shopping; South Africa; Systematic Review; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134341273

Traditional management mechanisms are no longer competitive unless used in conjunction with dynamically developing digital technologies. This article reviews the lifecycle of a ""digital corporation"" from the moment of its establishment (i.e., from the moment it acquires legal capacity), the processes related to its governance and management (intra-corporate and intra-productive relations), as well as the documentation of the outcome of its business and production activities. We discuss the ""digital footprint"" left by corporations in public registers, a unified space of trust implemented as a digital interactive environment, ""digital afterlife,"" and the adjustment of the legal capacity of corporations in view of the automation of their business processes. Furthermore, we provide several examples of digital management tools that are replacing traditional forms of management that rely solely on human cognition. We introduce three types of digital management: remote management (exercised by humans); smart management (based on algorithms designed by human engineers); and artificial intelligence (AI) management (that does not require human involvement). The article discusses the distinctive characteristics of each of these types of management and their potential joint application. Legal risks associated with the use of digital technologies for the assessment and documentation of production and economic activities (e-accounting, cloud data, open-access information, public registers) are identified. The study relies on empirical economic, legal and technological data pertaining to the legal status of a modern mixed-capital business corporation. We present an overview of currently available IT solutions for digital corporation (e-corporation) management and modification of traditional management tools, and provide an assessment of the prospects for the future development of these technologies. We emphasize the role of law in the digitalization of the economy and offer approaches to legislative work aimed at the legal regulation of modern corporate management. © 2022 The authors.","artificial intelligence; corporate governance; corporation; digital corporation; digital management; digital transformation; online management; smart management",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134304273

To the best of our knowledge, however, there is little research on the concept and model of the industrial intelligent system (IIS). To make up for the lack, this article presents the concept and reference model of IIS by analyzing the intelligentization requirement of the industrial systems. Different from academic research on general intelligent system capabilities, the reference model given emphasizes factors that need to be considered when implementing IIS in the industry. By analyzing the reference model, knowledge as the core driving force of IIS is recognized. Then, the four main forms of knowledge in IIS, as well as the role and key technologies of knowledge in different stages of IIS, are discussed in detail.

The analysis of scientific publications and results of technical and technological initiatives in the field of railway transport revealed that the industry business ecosystem based on ontologies would determine the nature of digital transformation in railway universities. This idea, however, has not yet been sufficiently developed in education studies. It is obvious that ontologisation will require new conceptual solutions and tools to be implemented. The authors propose a new didactic concept called ""knowledge factory"". The implementation of this didactic concept requires the development of ontology-based didactic tools. In particular, standardisation of education content through the concepts and relations in ontologies makes it possible to develop a web-application such as an intelligent tutoring agent. The study involved two stages. The first stage - conceptual - grounded the new ""knowledge factory"" didactic concept and the ontological model of interaction between the railway industry and railway universities. For this purpose, the authors applied the methods of ecosystem and ontological-semantic approaches. At the second stage - practical - an attempt was made to develop a prototype of an intelligent tutoring agent. With this purpose a fragment of ontology for the education course ""Artificial Intelligence Systems in Transport: Agent-Based Approach"" was developed. The top-down method was applied to develop this ontology. What is also emphasized is that the findings are to a large extent transferable to many industries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

For the many organizations active in this sector and the societies they are based in, innovation in hospitality services is considered their lifeblood. Recent advancements in digitalization, artificial intelligence, robotics, communications technologies, and platform-based new business models are transforming the global business environment at a rapid pace. However, unlike many other service sectors, the hospitality and tourism sectors are unique in their focus on people, experiences, and the wider ecosystem (i.e., society and the environment). The unique makeup of the hospitality sector, therefore, demands a distinctive approach to innovation. This study aims to examine service innovation with a focus on the hospitality sector. It provides a holistic theoretical framework and proposes an agenda for future research. The framework suggests the hospitality experience to be at the core of innovation in this sector. Consequently, hospitality firms must focus on creating value through both technological and nontechnological innovation. This innovation must be facilitated in a symbiotic manner, with a strong focus on people at its center, showcasing the “soul” of the hospitality across the extended “footprints” of the experience. © The Author(s) 2022.","ecosystems; experience footprint; hospitality; hospitality ecosystem; innovation; soul of hospitality service innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134233852

Design/methodology/approach: The study consisted of two phases. Phase one focused on identifying top higher education institutions according to the QS world university ranking. As a result, 180 higher education institutions in the Arab region were found, with the 2022 QS Arab region university ranking. The study selected top 20 performing institutions. Each institution has been assessed according to six metrics including: international student ratio, international research network, international ration, Web impact, citation per page and paper per faculty. Phase two explored the adapted Al applications and their related aspects that are used in each institution using a learning online questionnaire. Pilot tests were used to determine the validity and reliability of the measures. Findings: Numerous factors that lead to enhancing high education using Artificial Intelligence in higher education institutions have emerged from this study. These factors include; knowledge management, trust, learning, technical resources and complexity. First, effective knowledge management assists in maintaining information in a place where it is easy to share and access. Second, trust is considered a critical factor in dealing with uncertainties like covid-19. It needs to be effectively addressed by students and staff members, especially in higher education. Without trust, decisions cannot be successfully made and actions may be delayed or stalled. Third, continuous learning is a key factor that tends to enhance the capability of dealing with new routines or potential challenges. Fourth, technical resources refer to electronic devices and tools that are used by students and academics to interact and share knowledge. Originality/value: Students and faculty academics perceive things and use Al technology differently, which can lead to misunderstanding and create tension between them. Many higher education institutions have adapted great Al technology applications, but they are significantly less proficient than previously thought at understanding how to leverage this technology to produce helpful solutions to their business difficulties. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Covid-19; Higher education",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134210313

AI-powered information and Big Data (simply data henceforth) have quickly become some of the most important strategic resources in the global economy. However, their value is not (yet) formally recognized in financial statements, which leads to a growing gap between book and market values and thus limited decision usefulness of the underlying financial statements. The objective of this paper is to identify ways in which the value of data can be reported to improve decision usefulness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the authors' experience as both long-term practitioners and theoretical accounting scholars, the authors conceptualize and draw up a potential data value chain and show the transformation from raw Big Data to business-relevant AI-powered information during its process. Findings: Analyzing current International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) regulations and their applicability, the authors show that current regulations are insufficient to provide useful information on the value of data. Following this, the authors propose a Framework for AI-powered Information and Big Data (FAIIBD) Reporting. This framework also provides insights on the (good) governance of data with the purpose of increasing decision usefulness and connecting to existing frameworks even further. In the conclusion, the authors raise questions concerning this framework that may be worthy of discussion in the scholarly community. Research limitations/implications: Scholars and practitioners alike are invited to follow up on the conceptual framework from many perspectives. Practical implications: The framework can serve as a guide towards a better understanding of how to recognize and report AI-powered information and by that (a) limit the valuation gap between book and market value and (b) enhance decision usefulness of financial reporting. Originality/value: This article proposes a conceptual framework in IFRS to regulators to better deal with the value of AI-powered information and improve the good governance of (Big)data. © 2022, Susanne Leitner-Hanetseder and Othmar M.

And the natural language processing used is related to artificial intelligence (AI) and mathematical linguistics. From a scientific point of view, this factor implies the problems of computer analysis and synthesis of texts in natural languages, where analysis means understanding the language, and synthesis means generating literate text. Processing techniques for converting unstructured data into information understandable to artificial intelligence systems are analyzed so that such systems can take on some individual functions of human intelligence, and on the other hand, provide business users with opportunities for how and when they can have access to such resources. The uniqueness of this development lies in a serious change in the culture of using such solutions, where each authorized business user has access to the source data, based on which such users can conduct their own analysis, with their own tools. And developers can add additional functionality using their authorized ecosystems. Thus, this development implies a new approach to isolated data in the field of business applications in industrial sectors. Such a transition expands business opportunities in its subject area and is a motivating force. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Center of Excellence (CoE); Cutural Change; Cybersecurity; Digital Twin; Document Oriented NoSQL Data Store; Industrial IoT (IIoT); Industry 4.0 (I4): Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR); Internet of Things (IoT); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Performance Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Industry 4.0; Natural language processing systems; Production control; Artificial intelligence; Center of excellence; Centers of excellence; Cutural change; Cyber security; Data store; Document oriented NoSQL data store; Industrial IIoT; Industrial revolutions; Industry 4.0 : fourth industrial revolution; Internet of thing; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Performances analysis; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134004929

Several organizations choose to combine robotic tools for physical jobs, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Neural Network (NN) -based applications for optimizing the flow of work, minimizing human error, and executing chores faster, safer, and more reliably. Simple tasks that require a little time every day can be done automatically by creating a simple AI-based app, conserving us a lot of time in the long run. Because time equals money, a technology that saves time may be extremely important and necessary for many people and businesses. Counting money, particularly coins, is a simple chore that causes many firms to waste several minutes each day and that may be conveniently completed by an application. Even though many physical machines can do this task, there are several drawbacks: they can be expensive if the device's accuracy is great, they are huge, not portable, and are viewed as a waste of money for small enterprises. Such counting machines are simply replaced with an application that recognizes the value of the coins and counts the exact value. A coin-counting application can be useful for calculating the total number of coins inside a deposit account from home, or for calculating coins at the end of a shift in commerce. The objective of this work is to create an application that calculates the total worth of Romanian coins from an input image. The developed application is divided into two components: coin recognition and coin classification. The end application should be able to detect currency in an image and distinguish between coins worth 10 Bani and coins worth 50 Bani. © 2022 IEEE.","AI-based application; automated coins recognition; coins classification","Intelligent robots; Artificial intelligence-based application; Automated coin recognition; Coin classification; Coin recognition; Counting system; Machine-learning; Robotic tools; Romanians; Simple++; Technological advancement; Image classification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134002116

Big data visualization has become one of the important research contents in scientific computing. Against the background of rapid development of information technology and digital technology, the scale of digital economy is increasing day by day, and China's digital economy has ushered in unprecedented progress, and it has become an important force in leading economic development. The development of digital economy promotes industrial upgrading and transformation and facilitates industrial integration, and many traditional industries have given rise to a series of new industries. Scientific computational visualization is a new research discipline with a wide range of applications, including energy surveying, natural sciences, finance, and business. However, as a brand-new discipline, further research is needed in areas such as the application of scientific computational visualization techniques based on the digital economy environment. In this study, we propose a scientific computing visualization approach based on a big data framework for industry convergence analysis in the context of digital economy, which consists of a cloud computing platform for industry convergence in the context of digital economy by integrating neural networks in the platform, and scientific computing visualization by built-in GPU hardware. Traditional research methods for scientific computing visualization are discussed, and algorithms and techniques are classified in terms of the types of data domains studied. Finally, the further development and research directions of scientific computing visualization in the big data environment are given in conjunction with the main theoretical and application results achieved by our group in scientific computing for the field of big data visualization. Scientific computing visualization will not only promote the development and application of cutting-edge information technology, like cloud computing, big data, cyber security, artificial intelligence, computational science, system theory, and so on, but also bring a unique and disruptive development and change to the industrial integration in the context of digital economy. © 2022 Shiyuan Zhou et al.",,"Big data; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer hardware; Data visualization; Economic and social effects; Industrial economics; Computational visualization; Digital economy; Digital technologies; Economic development; Hardware and software; Industrial integration; Industrial transformations; Industrial upgrading; Industry convergence; Traditional industry; Visualization",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133974382

However, it is the B2B service sector that shows the highest growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Beyond a vibrant stream of literature on servitization, the B2B literature has neglected drawing on the wider service literature. This paper aims to examine recent streams of service research that have promising implications and research opportunities for B2B marketing. Design/methodology/approach: Together, the author team has decades of research, managerial and executive teaching experience related to B2B marketing and services marketing and management. The observations and reflections in this paper originate from this unique perspective and are supplemented by insights from 16 expert interviews. Findings: The authors identify and discuss in this paper four broad and related themes from the service literature that can stimulate B2B research and practice. First, the authors highlight the implications for capturing value in economies with their rapidly increasing specialization and related growth in B2B services. Specifically, the authors explain where B2B firms should focus on to gain bargaining power in the value chains of the future. Second, an additional strategy to enhance a B2B firm’s power to capture value is servitization, which allows firms to get closer to their customers, increase their switching costs and build strategic partnerships. The authors explore how firms can use service productization to enhance their chances of successful servitization. Third, servitization is expensive, and productivity and scalability are often a challenge in B2B contexts. These issues are tackled in a recent service research stream on cost-effective service excellence (CESE) where the authors derive implications for B2B firms.

The focus is to optimize the conventional threat modeling approach to explore software system vulnerabilities. Data produced in the software development processes are better leveraged using Machine Learning approaches. A large amount of industry knowledge around security vulnerabilities can be leveraged to enhance current threat modeling approaches. Work done here is in the ecosystem of software development processes that use Agile methodology. Insurance business domain data are explored as a target for this study. The focus is to enhance the traditional threat modeling approach with a better quantitative approach and reduce the biases introduced by the people who are part of software development processes. This effort will help bridge multiple data sources prevalent across the software development ecosystem. Bringing these various data sources together will assist in understanding patterns associated with security aspects of the software systems. This perspective further helps to understand and devise better controls. Approaches explored so far have considered individual areas of software development and their influence on improving security. There is a need to build an integrated approach for a total security solution for the software systems. A wide variety of machine learning approaches and ensemble approaches will be explored. The insurance business domain is considered for the research here. CWE (Common Weaknesses Enumeration) mapping from industry knowledge are leveraged to validate the security needs from the industry perspective. This combination of industry and company data will help get a holistic picture of the software system's security. Combining the industry and company data helps lay down the path for an integrated security management system in software development. The risk management framework with the quantitative threat modeling process is the work's uniqueness. This work contributes toward making the software systems secure and robust with time. © 2013 IEEE.","integrated security management system; machine learning; quantitative risk assessment; Quantitative threat modeling; software security","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Computer software; Ecosystems; Insurance; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Risk assessment; Security of data; Software design; And integrated security management system; Machine-learning; Quantitative risk assessment; Quantitative threat modeling; Risks management; Security; Security management systems; Software; Software security; Software-systems; Threat modeling; Risk management",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133705570

This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword-based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword-based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development. Managerial Summary: Text-based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre-defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI-based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

The proliferation of data leads to a surge in the demand for communication, which in turn promotes a surge in the demand for language services. Big data technology is a comprehensive technology, and its important feature is a more active technological factor, where technological development and technological innovation dominate, which will have an incalculable impact on the development of the translation industry. In the language service industry, much information that used to be difficult to quantify will be transformed into data for storage and processing, and a large number of complex items to be translated will gradually surface. Therefore, it is the general trend of the translation industry to stimulate and utilize the unexplored values hidden inside the data and develop the blue ocean of the language service industry. Traditional translation researchers are confined to the study of language and text and are not fully aware of it. The huge role played by translation technology in today's business environment, and the traditional translation theory can hardly describe and explain the new modern translation technology phenomenon and translation technology activities. Whether we are ready for it or not, the rapid development of translation technology in the era of big data will lead to significant changes in translation inquiry and translation teaching on a global scale. The integration and development of translation with cloud computing, big data, the Internet, and artificial intelligence are driving a series of innovations in the traditional translation model. The development of translation technologies and tools is breaking new ground, rapidly expanding into all aspects of the translation industry and triggering disruptive changes in the language service industry. © 2022 Xiaoyu Li.",,"Computation theory; Digital storage; Translation (languages); Blue oceans; Business environments; Comprehensive technology; Data technologies; General trends; Important features; Service industries; Technological development; Technological factors; Technological innovation; Big data",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133696332

The emergence of new formal and informal institutions should regulate the rules of behaviour of economic agents in the digital economy. To this end, it is necessary to form and develop a legal framework that regulates the relationship between customers and owners of digital platforms. We believe that digital ecosystems will have a certain interest in the new society. Unlike traditional models of interaction between actors, digital ecosystems will create a single information field and a new form of constructive cooperation and coordination between participants in the virtual space.

Each year there are approximately more than 10 million new cases of skin cancer recorded globally-this number is alarming. The survival rate is very low if diagnosed in later stages. Artificial Intelligence can play a very important role in using Medical Image Diagnosis to detect this disease in early stages. However, the AI systems for the classification of different skin lesions, are still in the very early stages of clinical application in terms of being ready to aid in the diagnosis of skin cancers. Moreover, there are not many players who are doing research in this direction for conditions specified in the Indian subcontinent. The present paper focusses on advancement in AI solutions in digital image based computer vision for the diagnosis of skin cancer, Some of the challenges and future opportunities to improve the ability to diagnose skin cancer in early stages have also been discussed. Using the HAIS AI tool, we present a computer-aided method, using computer vision and image analysis algorithms for Skin Cancer diagnosis, with improved accuracy. Our solution is focused on the Indian sub-continent and envisions catering to varied business needs that provide flexibility on its adoption and use. © 2022 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; DCNN; Healthcare; Image classification; Skin Cancer","Artificial intelligence; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided diagnosis; Computer vision; Dermatology; Diseases; Image enhancement; Medical imaging; AI systems; DCNN; Healthcare; Images classification; Late stage; Medical image diagnosis; New case; Skin cancers; Skin lesion; Survival rate; Image classification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133489570

Nevertheless, ML/DL technologies' industrial development and deployment examples are still rare and generally confined within a small cluster of large international companies who are struggling to apply ML more broadly and deploy their use cases at a large scale. Meanwhile, current AI market has started offering various solutions and services. Thus, organizations must understand how to acquire AI technology based on their business strategy and available resources. This paper discusses the industrial experience of developing and deploying ML/DL use cases to support organizations in their transformation towards AI. We identify how various factors, like cost, schedule, and intellectual property, can be affected by the choice of approach towards ML/DL project development and deployment within large international engineering corporations. As a research result, we present a framework that covers the trade-offs between those various factors and can support engineering companies to choose the best approach based on their long-term business strategies and, therefore, would help to accomplish their ML/DL project deployment successfully. © 2022 ACM.","Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; developing and deploying AI project; Engineering industry; Machine Learning","Cost engineering; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Strategic planning; Business strategy; Deep learning; Developing and deploying AI project; Engineering industries; Industrial deployment; Industrial development; Learning projects; Learning technology; Machine-learning; Optimal approaches; Commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133479649

Findings from our review show that the practitioner-oriented literature foreshadowed the rise of FinTech by extensively reporting on algorithm-based and electronic trading (2009 onwards), followed by reporting on FinTech start-ups and funding successes (2014 onwards). The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending. However, the body of work at the intersection of FinTech and IS is still small.

Machine learning (ML) is a sort of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables software programs to improve their prediction accuracy without being expressly designed to do so. Machine learning is significant because it enables businesses to see changes in customer behavior and company operating practices while also assisting in the creation of new goods. In recent years, blockchain technology has become increasingly popular. Individuals can interact directly with each other through a highly secure and decentralized system, without the need for a middleman, thanks to this technology. Machine learning, in addition to its strengths, may assist in overcoming many of the restrictions that blockchain-based systems face. These two technologies when combined can produce high-performing and valuable solutions. In this manuscript, blockchain technology and how machine learning skills can be combined with a blockchain-based system are studied.

Since the role of AI engineer is relatively new, limited research has been done on the requirements as set by the industry. Moreover, the definition of an AI engineer is less established than for a data scientist or a software engineer. In this study we explore, based on job ads, the requirements from the job market for the position of AI engineer in The Netherlands. We retrieved job ad data between April 2018 and April 2021 from a large job ad database, Jobfeed from TextKernel. The job ads were selected with a process similar to the selection of primary studies in a literature review. We characterize the 367 resulting job ads based on meta-data such as publication date, industry/sector, educational background and job titles. To answer our research questions we have further coded 125 job ads manually. The job tasks of AI engineers are concentrated in five categories: business understanding, data engineering, modeling, software development and operations engineering. Companies ask for AI engineers with different profiles: 1) data science engineer with focus on modeling, 2) AI software engineer with focus on software development, 3) generalist AI engineer with focus on both models and software. Furthermore, we present the tools and technologies mentioned in the selected job ads, and the soft skills. Our research helps to understand the expectations companies have for professionals building AI-enabled systems. Understanding these expectations is crucial both for prospective AI engineers and educational institutions in charge of training those prospective engineers. Our research also helps to better define the profession of AI engineering.

The most challenging factor is handling the post-pandemic scenario in various sectors such as medical, educational, civil services, business, etc. Every sector put its efforts in the best possible way to cope up with these unprecedented times. The majority of the sectors came up with the idea of work from home, robotics, online payment system, entertainment, meetings, webinars, etc., to continue with the smooth working environment. To manage this crisis, it is essential to be equipped with appropriate tools and technologies. These technologies may differ from sector to sector to satisfy their essential requirements. Among these, the educational sector is the only domain in which the entire transition happened from the classroom model to a fully virtual model of service. The digitalization of the educational system ensured the continuous delivery of education without any requirement of physical presence. The proposed idea uses data science techniques to understand the crisis in a better way and improvise the quality of education. In the medical sector, there are various techniques like online consultation with doctors, telemedicine and chatbots. Augmented Reality solutions provide a better platform for convenient, smooth and safe doctor-patient interaction. Data science techniques are implied to build an efficient novel approach for early diagnosis in medical sectors and reduce the mortality rate. Similarly, in other sectors such as business and civil services, there are betterments going to be brought about in a virtual environment. The segment which is facing the repercussions of this deadly virus is the common man, especially farmers, small businessmen, daily wagers, elders, children, and patients. Considering the current situation of the common public, one should try to make a brave new world, which is more adaptable, sustainable and stronger to mitigate the risks.

These voice assistants are at the forefront of organizational frontlines, service encounters, and customer experience. In the wake of digitalization and artificial intelligence, companies embrace such technologies by rule-based automating business processes. One area of application for digital voice assistants is service encounters in call centers. Research on call centers identifies service expertise, interaction competence, and linguistic qualities of human agents as key determinants of consumers’ satisfaction and loyalty (e.g., Cheong et al. 2008; Dean 2004; Gerpott/Paukert 2012). This study investigates acceptance of digital voice assistants as call center agents. If consumers accept the technology in such service encounters, it questions whether digital voice assistants can either reduce workload or replace human call center agents. The empirical results present a general willingness of consumers to engage with digital voice assistants in such service encounters. Consumers expect such service encounters to be free of effort and that the technical system is readily available, flexible, and reliable. Male consumers particularly emphasize technical usability. Even though the empirical results do not statistically support the effect of linguistic qualities, this finding can be attributed to the preexisting experience with voice systems in smartphones and smart speakers. Consumers consequently assume that digital voice assistants perform in service encounters at least as good as their personal devices. In contrast, consumers do not attribute much interaction competence to digital voice assistants. Consumers seem to be predominantly interested in the solving capabilities of digital voice assistants in the service encounter. As a result, service expertise is perceived as more important than emotional value. Digital voice assistants need to primarily fulfill their perceived intended purpose if they are to assume the role of call center agents and resolve corresponding service tasks. Emotional value also positively affects consumers’ perceived usefulness. Regarding the engagement with digital voice assistants, consumers value a positive, enjoyable, and relaxed atmosphere. These aspects are in particular relevant for female consumers in the present service encounter setting. Digital voice assistants should not only provide requested information but also process and resolve consumers’ concerns. As a result, digital voice assistants should facilitate problem-solving in a professional service fashion. Based on their accessibility and usefulness, consumers anticipate digital voice assistants being informative, useful, and positive in service encounters. Consumers thus form favorable attitudes towards engaging with these digital assistants and are intending to use these assistants in the foreseeable future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Call center; Digital voice assistant; Emotional value; Interaction competence; Linguistic quality; Service encounter; Service expertise",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133324262

It follows therefore that it is increasingly important to adapt business models and adopt systems that are effectively capable of handling data, using artificial intelligence (AI). The financial industry is one of the sectors of the economy that will face the challenges of this transition. This study aims to understand what the perceptions of AI are and its impact in the financial sector. Thus, descriptive statistics were used to understand financial professionals´ and AI experts’ views on AI. It was possible to conclude that perceptions regarding the impact that AI may have on this industry are different when seen from an operational perspective as opposed to a strategic perspective. Additionally, the adoption of AI accrues benefits not only to the systems themselves, but also to to the companies that are proprietors of innovative technologies.

The main personnel management system primarily completes business operations related to daily personnel file management, while the data mining subsystem mines talent data using the DT (decision tree) classification algorithm to aid talent selection. At the same time, a new topology optimization algorithm based on the principle of minimum rigidity graph is proposed for talent management system wireless network optimization. The maximum-minimum balance criterion and the user-by-user optimization mechanism are designed to obtain the optimal relay selection and subchannel allocation strategy, ensuring the system's reliability and fairness. The optimized algorithm has a user security satisfaction of 0.93 in the range of 250 m, which is higher than other algorithms. It demonstrates that this algorithm's communication link is short, and it has good network connectivity and structural stability.

The current study aims to investigate the interaction effect of demographic variables on confusion, decision postponement as a negative consequence of confusion and self-efficacy as a moderator in light of the stimulus organism response (SOR) model. Also, an attempt has been made to integrate the smart technology-based solution to deal with consumers' confusion. Design/methodology/approach: Three-way ANOVA, Andrew Hayes process, structural equation modelling and random forest algorithm were used to assess the 507 self-filled questionnaire responses for examining consumers' confusion. Findings: The results reveal that confusion decreases with increased education levels for each gender and age group. Also, for every gender and education level, consumer confusion increases and then decreases. Further, it was observed that self-efficacy effectively moderates the influence of different confusions on decision postponement. An artificial intelligence-enabled predictive model with an accuracy of 71.49% was established, which forecasts the possibility of consumers' decision postponement. Practical implications: This study offers the comprehension of how the travel site administrators and stakeholders have used artificial intelligence-enabled solution for consumers' confusion and to reduce decision postponement. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' awareness, this is one of the first studies to unveil the interaction effect of demographic factors on confusion, assess the role of self-efficacy as a moderator and provide artificial intelligence-enabled solutions for consumers' confusion. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Consumer confusion; Decision postponement; Self-efficacy; Tourism",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133266162

Unlike other traditional chatbot solutions that strictly rely on intent identification, our approach infers the implicit user need in order to provide the most relative documents and text snippets within, as the proper answer. To do this, we proceeded with a custom implementation based on Elasticsearch engine and most common NLP techniques tailored to our needs; i.e., tokenization, lowercase filtering, stop words removal, stemming, fuzzy searching, synonyms, etc. The main challenges as well as the architectural models that thrive to overcome them are being described in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed solution is being measured and the identified features for improvement are being presented. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Chatbot; Elasticsearch; Intent-lean; Lemmatization; NLP; Stemming; Synonyms","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; Elasticsearch; Emerging technologies; Intent-lean; Lemmatization; Question Answering; Stemming; Synonym; Telecom industry; Natural language processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133228336

Several complex threshold concepts were identified, and the learning objectives of the module were modified and aligned with new learning activities and assessment strategies to create meaningful and clear associations for the learners. The principles of universal design for learning (UDL) were applied when re-designing new online/blended materials. The module included asynchronous delivery of theoretical contents related to business that served as the main scaffolds supporting active learning group work. The group work was organized as a research-based scenario in which the learners develop a business idea and specify all the different elements needed for a realistic business to work by the completion of a “business canvas”. The alignment of the new learning objectives, activities and assessments was evaluated by a peer-observation of a session and the student’s feedback. Overall, the design of a flexible module that could be delivered in both fully online and blended learning environments facilitated the delivery of the content and promoted active learning in a way that was suitable and capable to adapt and engage with the learners during the challenging and ever-changing learning environment created by the COV-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Constructive alignment; Food business; Threshold concepts; Universal design for learning","Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Scaffolds; Blended learning environments; Constructive alignments; Food business; High educations; Learning assessment; Learning objectives; Online learning environment; Threshold Concepts; Universal Design; Universal design for learning; Computer aided instruction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133189020

These technologies are deployed in many industries. In this research, we are going to study the correlation between the complexities of financial reporting and the value of economic statistics in the context of Computer intelligence and information technology. Financial reporting is referred to as an accounting practice that involves processes like documentation & communication of financial activities. The performance over time of the companies is derived from the financial report. Financial reports provide vital information about the company's financial status and it also helps the company in decision making. Balance sheets, income statements, statements on shareholder equity, cash flow statements, are some of the types of financial reports. It facilitates tracking the cash flow, analyzing shareholder equity, evaluating the assets and liabilities, checking the profitability etc. Economic statistics are referred to us as the branch of applied statistics that deals with the collection and processing of economic data. It also compiles and analyzes the economic data. Financial reports check the money flow for businesses. Economic Statistics checks the larger trends that decide the money & resources flow. Even though, both help in making financial decisions there is some complexity between the two correlated fields.

Closed-loop control and its automation with artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) is a promising approach. However, most of such efforts focus on monitoring and analysis of resources. The challenges remain in automating operation of an entire service that consists of many resources in accordance with the results of the monitoring and analysis. We propose a scheme for automatically designing the topology and configuration of an entire service with various functional/non-functional requirements. To increase both the flexibility of the requirements and quickness to design, our scheme combines a model-based approach with AI/ML. It generates a huge number of design candidates through the model-based approach, and selects promising candidates efficiently by using AI/ML. We present the architecture of the proposed scheme and experiments we conducted involving a case study. Through the experiment, we confirmed that (1) the design speed was improved by 6 times autonomously, and (2) the increasing speed of design time with respect to the increase of intent size is significantly suppressed. © 2022 IEEE.","AI/ML; closed-loop control; service intent; system design automation","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Closed loop control systems; Artificial intelligence/machine learning; Closed-loop control; Design automations; Digital transformation; Machine-learning; Model based approach; Monitoring and analysis; Service intent; Service operations; System design automation; Computer aided design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133175272

Recently, there has been a major shift to artificial intelligence by businesses, government, and private sectors in general and the health sector in particular. Many studies have proven that artificial intelligence is contributing greatly to the health sector by discovering diseases and determining the best treatments for patients. Dentistry requires new innovative methods that serve both the patient and the service provider in obtaining the best and appropriate medical services. Artificial intelligence has the ability to develop the field of dentistry through early diagnosis and prediction of dental implant cases. This research develops a set of four machine learning algorithms to predict when a patient might need dental implants. These models are the Bayesian network, random forest, AdaBoost algorithm, and improved AdaBoost algorithm. This work shows that the developed algorithms can predict when a patient needs dental implants. Also, we believe that this proposal will advise managers and decision-makers in targeting patients with particular diagnoses. Analysis of the obtained results indicates good performance of the developed machine learning. As a result of this research, we note that the proposed improved AdaBoost algorithm increases the level of prediction accuracy and gives significantly higher performance than the other studied methods with the accuracy for the improved AdaBoost algorithm reaching 91.7%.

This paper develops a novel framework for exploring the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies for improving SROP. It highlights current best-practice examples and presents future research pathways. Design/methodology/approach: This viewpoint paper argues how Industry 4.0 technology adoption can enable effective SROP in the post-COVID-19 era. Academic articles, relevant grey literature, and insights from industry experts are used to support the development of the framework. Findings: Seven technologies are identified that bring transformational capabilities to SROP, i.e. big data analytics, digital twins, augmented reality, blockchain, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. It is demonstrated how these technologies can help to improve three sub-themes of organisational social performance (employment practices, health and safety, and business practices) and three sub-themes of community social performance (quality of life and social welfare, social governance, and economic welfare and growth). Research limitations/implications: A research agenda is outlined at the intersection of Industry 4.0 and SROP through the six sub-themes of organisational and community social performance. Further, these are connected through three overarching research agendas: “Trust through Technology”, “Responsible Relationships” and “Freedom through Flexibility”. Practical implications: Organisational agendas for Industry 4.0 and social responsibility can be complementary. The framework provides insights into how Industry 4.0 technologies can help firms achieve long-term post-COVID-19 recovery, with an emphasis on SROP. This can offer firms competitive advantage in the “new normal” by helping them build back better. Social implications: People and communities should be at the heart of decisions about rethinking operations and supply chains. This paper expresses a view on what it entails for organisations to be responsible for the supply chain-wide social wellbeing of employees and the wider community they operate in, and how they can use technology to embed social responsibility in their operations and supply chains. Originality/value: Contributes to the limited understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies can lead to socially responsible transformations. A novel framework integrating SROP and Industry 4.0 is presented. © 2022, Deepak Ram Asokan, Fahian Anisul Huq, Christopher M.

Among them, AI has sparked political, social, and economic effects, including industrial restructuring, new business models, data privacy laws, labor transformations, and new educational methods. These effects are particularly evident in rich democracies such as Germany, where AI is incentivized through government plans like the National Industrial Strategy 2030 and the Artificial Intelligence Strategy. However, several challenges characterize this technology diffusion. In this article, I analyze and interpret this phenomenon, investigating which political and economic dynamics outline the spread of AI in Germany. Materials and Methods: This research is based on 21 interviews conducted in Germany, with experts from the market and academia, between October 2019 and July 2020, in addition to the analysis of 16 government reports and literature review. Results: The results indicate that (1) AI has a variety of applications in the country, both in academic research and market goods and services, and (2) the government is approaching universities and companies to boost AI. However, (3) several challenges to the dissemination of AI and its effects have been identified: risks to the workforce associated with job automation, technological aversion by some social groups and business managers, entrepreneurial gap and limited number of start-ups, few qualified human resources in AI, data privacy policy still in adequacy, and deficits in digital infrastructure. Discussion: The study contributes to the literature on the political economy of AI in three aspects. First, it is one of the inaugurals works in Brazil to investigate AI through systematic field research. Second, despite its industrial and technological excellence, Germany faces challenges to enter digital economy, a phenomenon has not been too explored in the literature. Third, although it does not focus on Brazil, the study highlights potential challenges to Brazilian industrial and technological policy in a global scene of increasing digitalization. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.","Artificial intelligence; Germany; Industry 4.0.; Technology policy; Varieties of capitalism",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132988676

This study focuses on two aspects of technology which are digitization and digitalization of business processes in tourism industry in Malaysia. Due to movement constraints in Covid-19 pandemic, most of the related studies are conducted based on media report, peered review articles and research letters or empirical articles. There is a lack of case study to examine the effectiveness of various factors and how these factors impact the recovery of the post- pandemic tourism industry. A research case in earlier study implies that digitization and digitalization have an impact in recovery of tourism industry and insight gained motivates this study on effectiveness of smart tourism in Malaysia. Hence, this study aims to investigate effectiveness of smart tourism by using a self-developed mobile application which enables multiple trips organize in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Test cases are conducted among eleven managers in travel agencies and positive feedback are collected on system quality, perceived mobility, mobile usefulness, mobile ease of use and usage intention. Findings show that ICT has a major role in reviving business processes when tourism enters recovery phase. The study also discovered the importance of understanding the new patterns emerging which may include new tour packages or travel destinations that are emerging in future.

One of these are the challenges facing construction projects as for being physically present at the construction site to conduct site inspections. Artificial intelligence, robots, and state of the art communication technologies are increasingly adopted in businesses as part of their risk management activities to overcome these challenges. Recent literature on the utilization of drone technology in operations used the concept of “Dronification” to indicate the process of utilizing drones or “Unmanned Aerial Vehicles” (UAVs), to capture images and videos to serve several complex business operations. In this regard, the utilization of drones’ technology may be viewed as an essential tool for inspections during the periods of lockdowns and social distancing. In addition, this technology may be utilized to improve the quality of the inspection by obtaining information and detail that may not be readily obtained without expensive access methods and sometime the interruption of the service is required. This technology can aid structural engineers in performing different nondestructive tests and plan future destructive ones. Also, using drones would be considered as beneficial in highways and bridges inspections where safety is a major issue. This paper is designed to explore the use of drones’ technology in construction projects as a risk management tool in the events of pandemic. The study is designed to understand the perceptions and attitudes of the key stakeholders of construction projects regarding the use of drones’ technology for inspecting construction projects. © 2022, Jordan University of Science and Technology.

Besides this, this paper also seeks to explore qualitative and theoretical perspectives to underscore the importance of AI and big data applications in multi-sectoral scenarios of businesses across the world. Moreover, this paper also aims at working out the scope of ontological communicative perspectives based on AI alongside emphasizing their relevance in business organizations that need to survive and sustain with a view to achieve their strategic goals. Design/methodology/approach: This paper attempts to explore the qualitative perspectives to build a direction for strategic management via addressing the following research questions concerned with assessing the scope of ontological communicative perspectives in AI relevant to business organizations; exploring benefits of big data combined with AI in modern businesses; and underscoring the importance of AI and big data applications in multi-sectoral scenarios of businesses in today’s world. Employing bibliometric analysis along with NVivo software to do sentiment analysis, this paper attempts to develop an understanding of what happens when AI and big data are combined in businesses. Findings: AI and big data have tremendous bearing on modern businesses. Because big data comprises enormous information of diverse sorts, AI-assisted machines, tools and devices help modern businesses process it quickly, efficiently and meaningfully. Therefore, business leaders and entrepreneurs need to focus heavily on ontological and communicative perspectives to deal with diverse range of challenges and problems particularly in the context of recent crises caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: There is hardly any arena of human activity wherein AI and big data are not relevant. The implication of this paper is that of combining both well so that we may find answers to the difficult and challenging multi-sectoral scenarios concerning not just businesses but life at large. Moreover, automated tools based on AI such as natural language processing and speech to text also facilitate meaningful communication at various levels not just in business organizations but other fields of human activities as well. Social implications: This paper has layered social implications, as it conceptually works out as to how strategically we may combine AI and big data to benefit modern business scenarios dealing with service providers, manufacturers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, customers and consumers.

Because of the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, companies and organizations are increasingly utilizing AI-guided chatbots to improve service on their portals (AI). The decline in face-to-face services as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic has hastened this tendency. Because of recent developments in AI and machine learning, as well as broad usage of the internet and messaging platforms, businesses are focusing on chatbots. Chatbots are computer programs powered by artificial intelligence that can communicate with humans and engage in active dialogue. Because they are aware of human capabilities, they are sometimes known as virtual assistants. Chatbot technology is essential for famous product lines to prosper in the coming years. The paper’s major goal is to identify chatbots as an AI technology and to find the link between the two terms to determine how they contribute to various industries and marketing tactics, to create a better understanding to be used as a means of customer communication. The paper’s findings demonstrate that chatbot technology could be a beneficial technology that enables consumer to communicate, but firms should pay close attention to their customers' perspectives and design chatbots more efficiently by incorporating AI upon their needs and goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Machine learning; Natural language",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132825620

Several AI tools were presented in this chapter to shed the light on how such technologies can be implemented to improve organizational predictive capability and boost business performance. Thus, organizations are urged to implement AI systems to overcome forceful threats, as AI augments BI to achieve competitive advantages. Unescapably, AI transformation requires changes in both the individual and the collective mindsets in organizations. This chapter proposes an AI business model, named SHAM, to guide organizations in emerging countries towards AI-driven business transformation. Since the current study is descriptive in nature, the SHAM model was built based on an extensive literature review using the Comprehensive Literature Review Meta-Framework of the seven step model (CLR Meta-Framework). The SHAM model adapts the Sense-Think-Act paradigm which is a broad roadmap in robotics research to fit the business context. The Sense step is to conceptualize the organizational direction towards the new AI-driven entity; the Think step is to build a solid strategy for the AI transformation; and the Act step is to implement the strategy to reach the desired smart business. The model is conceived to empower organizations to transform into smart businesses to achieve competitive advantage, adaptation to the environment, and success. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AI; BI; Business transformation; SHAM model; Smart business",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132795240

The research has two main goals. First, providing a complete and organic analysis of the DARQ technologies framework currently missing in the literature. Because this research focuses on the financial sector, more attention is dedicated to DARQ technologies in this industry. Second, studying applications of one of the DARQ technologies, AI, in personalized banking, where it appears to have a great potential impact. Design/methodology/approach: The research analyses both the supply side, collecting secondary data from documentation, reports and research studies to study the major trends and results obtained by leading banks, and on the demand side, collecting primary data through a dedicated survey and elaborating opinions and preferences of potential customers. Using this information, a detailed go-to-market plan based on the framework elaborated by Bain and Co. in 2012 is developed, considering the hypothesis of a well-known universal bank, operating globally, with an established brand and access to modern AI technologies, which decides to invest in this field as a priority. Findings: In addition to giving a detailed overview of DARQ technologies from a technical and a business perspective, the results related to the hypothetical case of the study help to understand which would be the most suitable target for the launch phase, which value proposition should be offered and how to deliver it, but also how to evolve the project to attract more customers and strengthen the relationship with the existing ones. Nevertheless, this research could be a starting point for future studies and updates, considering related evolutions, investigating more representative demand samples or analyzing how the combination of more DARQ technologies could be applied to the financial sector. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations affect this work. First, the topics studied are evolving rapidly and partially dependent on other innovations under development; therefore, they may become obsolete and less significant in the next years. As regard the data collection, the supply-side analysis involves strategical information kept private by companies; therefore, the collected data probably miss some useful details. As concerns primary data, the sample could have been larger and more heterogeneous and biases and misinterpretations could have affected the answers. A compromise has been found between the time and resources available and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the sample. Practical implications: This research could be a tool for financial companies interested in investing in AI for personalized banking, but it also provides useful insights about the whole DARQ framework, which could be interesting for all the financial and nonfinancial firms. Applying AI effectively and efficiently could offer great benefits, both economic and noneconomic, to financial firms but also to their customers, who could benefit from hyper-tailored services at a reasonable and affordable price, whereas in the past, they were reserved only for very important person clients. This win-win situation could lead the way to further investments and consequent innovations in the future. Social implications: Some issues still exist, mainly about data security and privacy, but also the social risk linked to the labor market due to the AI substitution for some tasks and the related shift in professionals required by employers, which could negatively affect the salary gap among workers with different levels of educations, tightening up existing inequality problems. An effort by public and private subjects will be required to make this transition inside the labor market smoother. Despite this, the research shows that AI applications in personalized m-banking could mutually benefit both the demand and the supply of the market. Originality/value: Apart from the organic overview offered on DARQ technologies and their related business applications, currently missing in the literature, which could be useful for a better comprehension of the topic and could also give interesting insights to firms, this research presents an original and concrete roadmap to follow for financial companies interested in delivering a personalized mobile banking service leveraging on AI. Every step presented in the output of this work is based on an in-depth analysis of past, and present actions carried out and result obtained by competitive firms on the market and on needs and preferences observed among potential customers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; DARQ technologies; Mobile banking; Personalized banking",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132643571

More successful and efficient decisions can be learned and implemented by AI rather than routine and repetitive tasks. Investigations have shown that in some financial firms AI already dominates and outperforms people. The aim of the research was to find profitability in the trade and investment on the financial market from conventional against AI methods. On the basis of current work on the AI trading and investment business, the following questions are raised: what do AI trading benefits and disadvantages offer? In addition, how successful or risky is trading based on AI versus a conventional approach?, Budget and maintenance considerations. In this research, an online AI trading platform was introduced and TEDx was presented. In this analysis, AI's use in trade and investment as well as chaos and automation theories were used. Analysis of the above content reveals that it is time consuming for conventional trade methods to obtain and generate strategies by analysing them. Although it is costly to build an AI trading system, it can explore broad data and generate more and better results until, for instance, quickly pick-up stock. The findings showed that artificial knowledge has tremendous effects on trade and investment in financial markets. Although investing as an investor or as a small business is costly, at the same time, it has proved more lucrative for large finance companies. In different AI-based approaches, AI implementations are different depending on stocks and assets of different financial markets. Different timeframes and minor adjustments when the AI methods are scaled have different results; more study is therefore needed to define specific data trends on individual parts that may be more precise in terms of AI trade and investment performance. © 2021","AI impact on financial markets; AI-based trading; Artificial intelligence; Stock trading",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132599733

Most of the existing research approaches use centralized defense mechanisms to prevent DDoS attacks in IoT environments. However, it is important to provide a reliable and scalable solution to prevent DDoS attacks. Combining technologies such as distributed blockchain-based mechanisms and smart contracts facilitates the construction of a trusted distributed framework that can defend against DDoS attacks in IoT. In this article, we have proposed a multilevel DDoS mitigation approach (ML-DDoS) to protect IoT devices and other computing resources or machines using the blockchain-based framework. The core concept of the proposed system is to use a device-based verification mechanism using blockchain and exclude malicious devices from IoT environments. The proposed framework was developed using Hyperledger Caliper (a blockchain benchmark tool) and its performance was evaluated using three benchmark applications. Compared to the state of the art, the results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 35&#x0025; improvement in throughput, up to 40&#x0025; improvement in latency, and up to 25&#x0025; better utilization of CPU.

Unsupervised predictor is a technique that is used in all upbringings and algometry computations, and it is the foundation of all of them. The accuracy-based artificial intelligence and genetic algorithm-based prediction are becoming more important in business intelligence, with the crossover revealing the highest percentage of interest-based profit in the food industry. Our suggested approach aims to determine the utmost amplification of the food business profit with the help of food sale prediction. Hence, owners of outlet sale, supermarket sale, grocery store, and so on can maintain the stock. Therefore, our study strives to elucidate the relationship between food business intelligence and artificial intelligence in the context of soft computing. The study combines the previous data with the record of the current data and compares the existing development of business management in order to create the topic of the TOR method, which will be the artificial intelligence buzzword in the town-based food business intelligence. This paper uses artificial intelligence, business intelligence, and neural networks to forecast the food sale prediction by evaluating the data of each individual client. Consider the situation in which this technology is applied in every grocery store in the country. Our suggested model has achieved low mean squared error and low variance. Food mart owners will have a far better grasp of their clientele and will be able to categorise them in this situation, enabling them to proceed with future sales forecasting. © 2022 Daniyal Irfan et al.",,"Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Mean square error; Profitability; Soft computing; Artificial Intelligence and genetic algorithms; Business-intelligence; Food business; Food industries; Grocery stores; Sale predictions; Soft-Computing; Supermarket sales; Technological route; TOR method; Sales",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132334057

However, the published studies on AI are mostly reported by computer scientists using their own jargon which is unfamiliar to surgeons. Methods: A literature search was conducted in using PubMed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome of this review is to provide a glossary with definitions of the commonly used AI terms in surgery to improve their understanding by surgeons. Results: One hundred ninety-five studies were included in this review, and 38 AI terms related to surgery were retrieved. Convolutional neural networks were the most frequently culled term by the search, accounting for 74 studies on AI in surgery, followed by classification task (n = 62), artificial neural networks (n = 53), and regression (n = 49). Then, the most frequent expressions were supervised learning (reported in 24 articles), support vector machine (SVM) in 21, and logistic regression in 16. The rest of the 38 terms was seldom mentioned. Conclusions: The proposed glossary can be used by several stakeholders. First and foremost, by residents and attending consultant surgeons, both having to understand the fundamentals of AI when reading such articles. Secondly, junior researchers at the start of their career in Surgical Data Science and thirdly experts working in the regulatory sections of companies involved in the AI Business Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) preparing documents for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other agencies for approval. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence surgery; Deep learning surgery; Machine learning surgery",,Review,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132322530

Through the increasing availability of data in the context of digitalization as well as continuously more powerful and cost-effective possibilities for data processing, the amount of economically viable scenarios for implementing ML-based business models (BMs) in production rises. Despite the emerging data-related possibilities, especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle with identifying reasonable use cases for ML in their own company. This can be ascribed to a lack of knowledge about the necessary elements for ML applications' sustainable implementation and operation. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a framework for the holistic generation of ML-based BMs in manufacturing. At first, characteristics as well as general and specific requirements for ML-based BMs in manufacturing are elaborated. Subsequently, a morphology for the systematic development of ML-based BMs is generated using the insights gained.

Unfortunately, this rich source of information is undervalued and underutilized, and its full potential is not fully exploited by modern day manufacturers. In the Industry 4.0 era, exploiting these powerful datasets is becoming critical for manufacturers' survival and competitiveness in the age of artificial intelligence. Cooperative and mutual efforts between academia and the industrial sector to take advantage of these rich datasets have the potential to reap extraordinary benefits for business, the economy and society. Applying the latest artificial intelligence methods could increase production efficiencies and reduce environmental impacts. In view of the availability of large amounts of sensor data and its lack of full utilization, this research proposes an artificial intelligence solution that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA), machine learning-based simulation and genetic algorithms to optimize the efficiency of production systems through recommendations of the optimal model settings. First, DEA is used to identify the efficient and inefficient states of a production system, this information is input to the second step to build a machine learning model that makes predictions through simulations and production efficiency scenarios. Then, a genetic algorithm proposes an optimal scenario with the corresponding settings. The main research contribution of this proposed solution is its unique combination of DEA with machine learning models and genetic algorithms. © 2022 The Authors.

Due to the large financial scandals which have been recorded throughout the history, the need for “Forensic Accounting” has dramatically increased within business sphere. The pandemic of COVID-19 breeds several challenges for both governments and business firms in alleviating corporate scams, corruption, bankruptcy, money laundering, cybercrimes, and the like. The impact of such illegal practices hits the financial reporting and ultimately leads to misleading decisions. In fact, the internal and external auditors play different roles than the forensic accountants do. Seemingly, auditing and forensic accounting function in one area, but each drives its own way. Therefore, it is vital nowadays to assign forensic accountant who is well equipped with adequate knowledge, skills, and experience. Equally, it is essential to introduce forensic accounting education to meet the existed marketplace demands. This chapter is devoted to provide an overview about the concept of forensic accounting and how the entire world has significantly affected by the white-collar crimes especially during the global lockdown. In addition, it will clear the misunderstanding between forensic accounting and auditing.

Parametric estimation models are based on artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems that identify dependencies between product parameters and the costs of product development, manufacturing, and after-sales service. These dependencies are also used to search for the possibility of cost reduction through changes in designing a customized product. A problem of cost optimization is specified in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem and solved using constraint programming. All possible solutions are identified within requirements for a new product and business resources. The presented method consists of five steps: collecting data, conducting sensitivity analysis, identifying relationships, estimating costs, and identifying possible variants that ensure target costs.

Notwithstanding the operations-wise merits associated with the implementation of digital technologies, individually, their combined effect has been overlooked owing to limited real-world evidence. In this regard, this research explores the joint implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT) in supply chains for extending operations performance boundaries and fostering sustainable development and data monetisation. Specifically, this study empirically studied the tuna fish supply chain in Thailand to identify respective end-to-end operations, observe material and data-handling processes, and envision the implementation of AI and BCT. Therefore, we first mapped the business processes and the system-level interactions to understand the governing material, data, and information flows that could be facilitated through the combined implementation of AI and BCT in the respective supply chain. The mapping results illustrate the central role of AI and BCT in digital supply chains’ management, while the associated sustainability and data monetisation impact depends on the parameters and objectives set by the involved system stakeholders. Afterwards, we proposed a unified framework that captures the key data elements that need to be digitally handled in AI and BCT enabled food supply chains for driving value delivery. Overall, the empirically-driven modelling approach is anticipated to support academics and practitioners’ decision-making in studying and introducing digital interventions toward sustainability and data monetisation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain technology; Data monetisation; Fish supply networks; Supply chain digitalisation; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132150254

They’re using numerous advanced technologies to analyse marketing analytics. Artificial intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) technology are highly capable of examining large databases for patterns and insights. These technologies enable the marketing function to encompass its reach and analytics empower a deeper understanding of how the market responds to actions. With the help of Deep learning, businesses are now able to connect a wide range of datasets to better understand what customers want with greater sophistication and analytic capacity, and then use that information to gain a competitive advantage. In addition, Deep learning uses numerous technical tools that excel at extracting perceptions and patterns from huge amounts of data and then predicting the future for marketing. Thus, Deep learning can potentially be used to create products that are tailored to what customers want. It has been found that marketing analytics play a significant role in HRM. It helps in examining the employees’ skill sets and developing a training programme based on the market demands. AI assists firms in determining target audiences and devising a strategy to meet its objectives. Also, AI technology adapts and learns from data to make data-driven decisions. Many time-consuming and managerial chores will be automated by HR software that includes artificial intelligence. A lot of administrative activities are automated and speeded up using AI. Moreover, to gain in-depth knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning this paper is conducted.

A business-focused more on retaining existing customers than attracting new ones involves using the principles of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). CRM implies making key decisions regarding the company’s relationship with customers, so with the development of artificial intelligence and data science, this area has become an ideal field for the application of these methods. The level of automation is continuously increasing and will be emphasized in the coming period. By taking advantage of innovative technologies and integrating them into CRM systems, companies can achieve a better market advantage.

Expanding upon the rising promises of data cubes for analysis-ready big EO data, we propose a new geospatial infrastructure layered over a data cube to facilitate big EO data management and analysis. Compared to previous work on data cubes, the proposed infrastructure, GeoCube, extends the capacity of data cubes to multi-source big vector and raster data. GeoCube is developed in terms of three major efforts: formalize cube dimensions for multi-source geospatial data, process geospatial data query along these dimensions, and organize cube data for high-performance geoprocessing. This strategy improves EO data cube management and keeps connections with the business intelligence cube, which provides supplementary information for EO data cube processing. The paper highlights the major efforts and key research contributions to online analytical processing for dimension formalization, distributed cube objects for tiles, and artificial intelligence enabled prediction of computational intensity for data cube processing.

There is a strong tendency to anthropomorphize pets and other animals that carries over to smart machines, leading us to replace human relationships with something less sophisticated and subtle. As a result, we argue, humanizing machines actually tends to dehumanize the workplace. We take an anthropological approach to this phenomenon that teaches three important lessons. One is that Western cultures have a particularly strong tendency to anthropomorphize machines, due to what Max Weber called the disenchantment of nature. Another is that humans have long interacted with intelligent nonhuman beings, such as domesticated work animals, without anthropomorphizing them. Finally, we can take a cue from these interactions to create analogous relationships with robots by neither humanizing nor objectifying them, but by relating to them in a manner that suits their capabilities. In particular, we can avoid anthropomorphism by involving workers in the training of AI systems, much as our ancestors trained domesticated animals, and by introducing ritual activities involving robots that clarify their ethical status and guide our interaction with them. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Dehumanization; Intelligent robots",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131829027

Chatbots, increasingly used in various scenarios such as customer service, work productivity, and healthcare, might be one way of helping instructors better meet student needs. However, few empirical studies in the field of Information Systems (IS) have investigated pedagogical chatbot efficacy in higher education and fewer still discuss their potential challenges and drawbacks. In this research we address this gap in the IS literature by exploring the opportunities, challenges, efficacy, and ethical concerns of using chatbots as pedagogical tools in business education. In this two study project, we conducted a chatbot-guided interview with 215 undergraduate students to understand student attitudes regarding the potential benefits and challenges of using chatbots as intelligent student assistants. Our findings revealed the potential for chatbots to help students learn basic content in a responsive, interactive, and confidential way. Findings also provided insights into student learning needs which we then used to design and develop a new, experimental chatbot assistant to teach basic AI concepts to 195 students. Results of this second study suggest chatbots can be engaging and responsive conversational learning tools for teaching basic concepts and for providing educational resources.

Design/methodology/approach: The study examines contributing factors explaining the adoption intention of AI in the context of family businesses. The developed research model is examined and validated using structural equation modelling based on 631 respondents' data. Purposeful sampling is used to collect the respondents' data. Findings: The proposed model included two endogenous (i.e. business innovativeness and adoption intention) and six exogenous variables (i.e. affordances, culture and flexible design, entrepreneurial orientation, generativity, openness and technology orientation) through ten direct paths and three indirect paths. The results depicted the significant influence of all the exogenous variables on the endogenous variable reflecting support of all the hypotheses. The business innovativeness partially mediates the relationships of culture and flexible design, entrepreneurial orientation and technology orientation with adoption intention. Further, the results demonstrated a model variance of 24.6% for business innovativeness and 64.2% for adoption intention of artificial intelligence in the family business. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to theoretical developments in entrepreneurship and family business research and AI's theoretical progress, especially to digital entrepreneurship. Originality/value: Theoretically, it contributes to the literature of entrepreneurship, particularly digital entrepreneurship. Additionally, the research model adds to the role of entrepreneurial orientation and digital entrepreneurship in the emerging family entrepreneurship literature. Considering the scarcity of research in this field, the empirically validated model explaining critical antecedents of AI adoption intention in the family business is a foundation for discussion, critique and future research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business innovativeness; Digital entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurial orientation; Family business; Technology adoption",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131559340

It provides consumers the opportunity to interact with previously unknown ease to measure sources and connections to IT-managed services. Online shopping has been considered as one of the commonly used channels for easy shopping in the Internet world and becomes a convenient way to search for products from various places and to make the operation quicker. The digital economy is powered by high-speed Internet connectivity launched by IT as a practical platform for interaction between online shopping and organizations. The platforms for e-commerce have led to extensive international access by local consumers to goods and services. E-commerce has improved productivity in enterprises and has added to the economies in the countries of the business industry. However, e-commerce security is the primary concern to protect details from electronic theft such as credit card or debit card fraud, retailer, or bank leakage of details while a card is not used for purchases online. In this paper, Cloud Computing-Based Multilevel Decision Support System (CCMDSS) has been proposed for secure fund transfer in the e-commerce platform. Furthermore, this study utilizes cryptography techniques and multiple networks to safeguard the security of information and decrease the systematic risks. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances the efficiency and feasibility and secures the information while transferring the money. Compared with other models, Prediction Ratio validation has a significant improvement, and the error rate is greatly reduced, only 5.99%.

With data flowing from different and countless sources, exploring data in order to deliver actionable insights has become a daunting task with current OLAP tools despite the cycle of improvement that has gone through it. In the last decade, with the emergence of the big data phenomenon, NoSQL databases are seeing a spike in popularity and become more used in industry and academia as their value in handling a huge and varied amount of data become increasingly evident. Graph oriented database is one of the four chief types of NoSQL oriented databases that represent a promising technology candidate for big data analytics. In this paper we bring forward our contribution to graph-oriented analytical processing, which is twofold. First, we provide a novel approach for modeling a graph-oriented data warehouse. Second, we propose a data cube materialization through the precomputation of aggregated nodes. We present how typical OLAP queries can be performed against data warehouses stored in NoSQL graph-oriented database management systems. An implementation is conducted on a fictional data warehouse using Neo4j and the Cypher declarative language. The same dataset is stored in a relational data warehouse in order to compare storage space and query performance. Thus, the obtained results shows that graph OLAP implementation outperform clearly the relational alternative in term of query response time. © 2022.

Effective identification of audit risks can help auditors plan their audit work rationally and issue correct audit opinions. In the era of big data and the Internet, enterprises generate a large amount of data in their daily operations. For auditors, it is a great challenge to use data mining algorithms, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies to identify high-quality audit data from the vast amount of data of audited enterprises. At the same time, some companies may falsify and modify their financial statements for their own benefit, which further increases the difficulty for auditors in conducting audits. Traditional auditing methods are costly and consuming and cannot meet standard auditing requirements.

The paper focuses on causal ML/AI models for campaign targeting. Such models estimate the change in customer behavior due to a marketing action known as the individual treatment effect (ITE) or uplift. ITE estimates capture the value of a marketing action when applied to a specific customer and facilitate effective and efficient targeting. We consolidate uplift models for multiple treatments and continuous outcomes and perform a benchmarking study to demonstrate their potential to target promotional monetary campaigns. In this use case, the new models facilitate selecting the optimal discount amount to offer to a customer.

Specially, in time of crises, the use of Decision Support System (DSS) is useful since these situations demand greater accuracy in the decision-making process. Therefore, this study shows the usefulness of the Decision Support System constructed for the FITradeoff method in a practical context involving a decision-making in time of crisis. In special, in this study, the applicability of the FITradeoff DSS is discussed to solve an important problem involving a Brazilian Company. The FITradeoff DSS was employed for a compliance-program problem, in which a company sought to improve its performance in relation to the program. This problem is particularly significant in Brazil where the search for compliance programs has been increasing since the adoption of the anticorruption law. Thus, twenty-eight alternatives were created, and these alternatives were evaluated against five criteria. As a result, most of the alternatives in the top of the ranking are related to Internal Communication aspect. Hence, the DM considered that these alternatives are sufficient to direct the efforts to execute the Compliance Program, and in special this theme can be the focus in this company. Furthermore, in view of recurring crises around the world, companies must identify ways to ensure their internal processes support the sustainability of their business. For decision making in times of crisis, the DSS of the FITradeoff method is an effective tool allowing decision makers to handle complex decisions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Compliance program; Decision support system; FITradeoff Method; Multi-Criteria Decision-Making/Aiding (MCDM/A)","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Compliance program; Decision making aiding; Decision-making process; Decisions makings; Fitradeoff method; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criteria decision-making/aiding; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Time of crisis; Decision support systems",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131305991

This holds true as long as two postulates are verified; ""using data boosts quality of decision output""and ""people are willing to use data"". While support for the first one is significant, we find surprisingly too few pieces of evidence for the second one. The second postulate being unverified can however have some serious implications. If people do not want to use data but are actually constrained to do so for instance, they will face anxieties, poor understanding and reduced decision outcomes. If resistant people decide not to use data, they take the risk of missing important business opportunities. The alternative scenario, on which we focus in this project, is to understand this resistance and mitigate it to make resistant people more comfortable with data. There is currently no theory that offers a complete view on the resistance of people to data. Therefore, this project intends to propose a unified Resistance to Data Theory (RDT) with three main contributions: (1) RDT formation where we will design the theory by identifying existing factors that influence this resistance from the literature and uncovering new ones with qualitative studies, (2) RDT validation where we will validate the theory and (3) RDT exploitation where new approaches to Decision Support Systems will be identified to decrease resistance to data. Together, these three contributions provide a comprehensive view on a new fundamental issue (resistance to provided data) with a potentially significant switch in the perception of how data is used within an organization, and how data should be introduced to decision-makers to exploit its full potential more systematically. © 2021 The Authors.","Data Barriers; Data-Driven Decision-Making; Decision Support Systems; Resistance; Resistance to Data","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Competition; Decision making; Decision theory; Data barrier; Data driven decision; Data theories; Data-driven decision-making; Decision makers; Decisions makings; On-resistance; Resistance; Resistance to data; Unified theory; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131247971

At the same time, neural network technology is applied to solve nonlinear data modeling. Experiments and evaluation are carried out by using the artificial neural network (ANN) evaluation model. The experimental evaluation model data obtained from the experimental evaluation model show that the prediction effect is good, which proves the effectiveness of this method. According to the data of China Banking Regulatory Commission, at the end of the third quarter of 2016, the balance of nonperforming loans of Chinese commercial banks was 1493.9 billion yuan. By the end of the third quarter of 2021, the balance of nonperforming loans of Chinese commercial banks had reached 28153.5 trillion yuan, a month on month increase of about 42.7 billion yuan. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, the domestic and foreign currency assets of Chinese banking financial institutions were 339.4 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 7.7%. This shows that the credit risk remains high, but it is still at a controllable level. Commercial banks are the center of the modern economic system. Their credit risk is very important to the stability and safe development of national economy. It is also the key factor for its own business sustainability and the protection of the interests of depositors. Therefore, effectively preventing and reducing credit risk is a key field in the financial risk management of commercial banks. © 2022 Wei Feng and Ming Chen.",,"Deep neural networks; Economics; Finance; Risk management; Business-intelligence; Commercial bank; Credit risks; Credit scoring; Economic globalization; Evaluation models; Experimental evaluation; Market volatility; Neural-networks; Third quarters; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131158562

However, the ideal DSS for one decision maker may not optimally address the requirements for decision support of another decision maker. This is due to differences between decision makers in business goals, regulatory restrictions or availability of resources such as data. By using a suboptimal DSS, decision makers risk implementing suboptimal decision recommendations which endanger the success of their business. This presents DSS developers with the challenge to implement a customizable DSS which can be tailored to the individual requirements for decision support of a single decision maker. In order to address this challenge, we suggest a decision support ecosystem in which DSS developers, decision makers and other domain experts collaborate using a shared platform to provide and combine reusable decision support services into a tailored DSS. The contribution of our paper is twofold: First, we define the concept of a decision support ecosystem with respect to existing digital business ecosystems and discuss expected benefits and challenges. Second, we present a reference architecture for a shared platform supporting the realization of a decision support ecosystem.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is important in many aspects of our lives, including education, healthcare, business, and so on. AI has allowed for significant advancements in the educational system. It has quickly risen to the top of the list of the most rapidly expanding educational technology disciplines. Through its creation, AI has contributed to the creation of new educational and knowledge techniques that are currently being researched across a wide range of fields. Chatbots, Robots’ Assistant, Vidreader, Seeing AI, Classcraft, 3D holograms, and other AI-based programmes were developed to assist both teaching staff and students in using and improving the educational system. In the sphere of education, AI is focusing on sentimentalized artificial learning aids and smart instruction systems. The primary goal and objective of the education business is to construct an intelligent education system, which is now possible thanks to the development of teaching assistant robots, smart classrooms based on AI, and English teaching assistance, among other things. Artificial Intelligence techniques may now be employed at all stages of learning to improve the educational system. During the COVID-19 illness, students and teachers took their education and instruction online in a variety of ways. Learning can be done digitally so that folks do not fall behind in their education. The proposed study has considered multi-criteria decision support systems (MCDM) for AI-enabled production and application of English multimode online reading.

Since the maintenance process is not fully integrated with other business processes, it indicates that some of the problems in the maintenance process are caused by other departments. Additionally, nothing can be managed or improved without first measuring it. In order to enhance internal integration, this study developed a model that makes use of information systems data to examine synchronization and collaboration across departments engaged in maintenance operations. Design/methodology/approach: This research connects maintenance management and business process management through information systems. A conceptual module model based on CMMS is proposed that will use data which are already available in CMMS and, using process mining, will assess the level of synchronization between departments within an organization. Findings: This conceptual model will serve as a roadmap for creating better value-added CMMS software. This system operates as a performance measurement tool in three majors, including organizational analysis, workflow analysis and eventually, a future simulation of maintenance processes. This module will serve as a decision support system, highlighting opportunities for improvement in maintenance processes. Originality/value: A practical guideline is provided for the future development of CMMSs and their enhancement to intelligence. All assumptions are based on maintenance theories, techniques for measuring maintenance performance and business process management and process mining. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CMMS; EAM; Information systems; Lean smart maintenance; Maintenance; Maintenance performance measurement; Performance measurement; Process mining; Smart maintenance; Synchronization","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Enterprise resource management; Information management; Information systems; Maintenance; Synchronization; Business Process; CMMS; EAM; Fully integrated; Lean smart maintenance; Maintenance performance measurements; Maintenance process; Performance measurements; Process mining; Smart maintenance; Information use",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130950218

Ethical implementation of information systems is an important aspect of the curriculum in management institutions. Since students in business schools hail from different academic streams, they may come in with or without in-depth technical knowledge on the software/information systems that run the business. It becomes the duty of academia in this context, to educate them on the ethical challenges that managers would face in implementing disruptive technologies in their organizations. The onus on creating managers who can make humans out of machines (and not vice versa) is on the faculty in these management institutes. One of the most effective ways to achieve this objective is through the case study tool. The protagonist in this case, Sanjana is faced with a series of ethical issues in her new workspace which has recently undergone a digital transformation. The primary objective of this case study is to enable management students (who may not have in-depth technological knowledge and/or expertise) to: 1. Identify limitations of technological components (especially data sciences, AI, ML, and DL systems) in business given the growing levels of implementations of these systems in all business domains. 2.

However, no studies have yet discussed the issues from the perspective of stakeholders in Korea. This research aimed to identify stakeholders’ requirements for AI4H to accelerate the business and research of AI4H. Methods: We identified research funding trends from the Korean National Science and Technology Knowledge Information Service (NTIS) from 2015 and 2019 using “healthcare AI” and related keywords. Furthermore, we conducted an online survey with members of the Korean Society of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine to identify experts’ opinions regarding the development of AI4H. Finally, expert interviews were conducted with 13 experts in three areas (hospitals, industry, and academia). Results: We found 160 related projects from the NTIS. The major data type was radiology images (59.4%). Dermatology-related diseases received the most funding, followed by pulmonary diseases. Based on the survey responses, radiology images (23.9%) were the most demanding data type. Over half of the solutions were related to diagnosis (33.3%) or prognosis prediction (31%). In the expert interviews, all experts mentioned healthcare data for AI solutions as a major issue. Experts in the industrial field mainly mentioned regulations, practical efficacy evaluation, and data accessibility. Conclusions: We identified technology, regulatory, and data issues for practical AI4H applications from the perspectives of stakeholders in hospitals, industry, and academia in Korea.

With this adoption process, insurance companies can instantly respond to customer needs in the light of digital data and focus more on value-added areas. AI technologies also contribute to effective communication with customers, reduce costs, develop new products and services, and improve the competitive environment to prevent insurance companies from being indifferent to these technological developments. On the other side, these technologies identify potential risks in advance, inform the insured, and support them to take the required precautions. While this situation is supportive for the insured part, it may create a number of threats for insurance companies as it causes a decrease in insurance premiums. These threats are pushing insurance companies to go through a number of transformations in their business models to turn the disadvantaged situation in their favor. This being the case, addressing these innovations is of great importance not to fall behind these developments.

Entrepreneurship is an important phenomenon that increases individuals’ and countries’ welfare and plays a role in social transformation. Its importance appeals to a large number of researchers. What makes these studies possible to stand out from the research crowd depends on their design as modern, contemporary, and preliminary studies. The author also wanted to reveal the possibilities of artificial intelligence systems, which offer the opportunity to conduct innovative research, in the field of entrepreneurship. The chapter titled “The ‘Transformative’ Effect of Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) in Entrepreneurship” primarily targets researchers who are interested in entrepreneurship research and want to gain general information about the intersections with artificial intelligence. As it is known, artificial intelligence systems have highly specialized literature. This situation causes most researchers to develop a perception of the difficulty of the field. The author promises to transform this perception positively and discover artificial intelligence, which we inevitably have to dive into and learn, from the perspective of entrepreneurship, when the development of technology is considered. For this purpose, in the content design of the chapter, how artificial intelligence will affect the entrepreneurship classification and the way entrepreneurs do business; how artificial intelligence will transform the big picture through entrepreneurship; what can be the usage of artificial intelligence for entrepreneurs; how artificial intelligence will affect entrepreneurship education; how will artificial intelligence affect entrepreneurship research with the use of new technologies for data gathering and data analyzing are included. It can be said that the chapter has a guiding quality, especially for graduate students who want to do entrepreneurship research but have not yet determined the research subject. For example, the subject of postgraduate research may be how artificial intelligence systems will transform the gender-based problems faced by women entrepreneurs. The steps in the literature regarding this subject can be found in the chapter. This book, in which artificial intelligence is evaluated from various perspectives, could be said to be incomplete if it did not include a discussion in terms of entrepreneurship. With this awareness, the author endeavored to offer her readers a good reading and knowledge acquisition experience by referencing as many sources as possible and sharing different ideas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","AIS; Business model; Digital entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurial behavior; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial opportunity; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship classification; Entrepreneurship education; Entrepreneurship research; Social entrepreneurship",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130842533

The healthcare industry produces large volumes of data, and challenges in cost and patient outcomes are increasing. In order to provide health services in the fastest, most accurate, and highest quality way while also meeting the needs of both patients and healthcare organizations, healthcare professionals must reach the most accurate and up-to-date information and utilize this information by using computerized support systems. For this reason, it is inevitable for healthcare systems to become a structure supported by artificial intelligence that both speeds up and facilitates the way of doing business and provides some basic information and services to patients without being too dependent on the system. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can recursively improve itself based on the information it gathers. By increasing the availability of healthcare data and enabling rapid progress in analytical techniques, it brings paradigm changes to healthcare services. Artificial intelligence has been used or tested for a variety of health and research purposes, including management of chronic conditions, workload reduction of doctors and nurses, drug discovery, provision and prevention of health care, diagnosis, treatment of diseases, and patient monitoring. Artificial intelligence has the ability to transform medicine through the role of physicians and nurses and to transform medicine through new science research and delivery models that revolutionize medical practices and enhance person and public health outcomes.

This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks. © 2022 IEEE.","Autonomous connected vehicles; blockchain; digital forensics; privacy and security","Access control; Artificial intelligence; Automotive industry; Autonomous vehicles; Blockchain; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Insurance; Network security; Security systems; Automotives; Autonomous connected vehicle; Block-chain; Business models; Industry vision; Insurance companies; Privacy and security; Privacy issue; Security and privacy; Security issues; 5G mobile communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130804594

In this context, the transformation of accounting in the digital age aims to ensure efficiency in accounting transactions with real-time accounting information system integration. In terms of real-time accounting, it is important to benefit from the power of new technologies by connecting all current technologies to every stage of financial accounting processes and to establish a solid integrated system. The contribution of every new technology to the process is inevitable within the scope of cloud-based accounting information systems. In order to find an answer to the question of how artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies will affect cloud-based accounting systems, a detailed literature review has been conducted and discussed conceptually. In this context, the study focuses on the advantages of cloud-based accounting systems unlike traditional accounting systems, the effectiveness of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies in accounting processes, and the synergy of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Today, accounting basic functions have been significantly integrated into artificial intelligence technology. Decentralized artificial intelligence emerging as a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain allows the processing of reliable, digitally signed, and secure shared data that is stored on a decentralized and distributed blockchain without trusted third parties or intermediaries. The basic understanding of this decentralized, reliable, and secrecy system is based on the reliability and credibility of information. Central data storage can be highly sensitive in terms of security and privacy when it contains personal and private data about users, operations, and financial information. Artificial intelligence applications can expose the capacity and scaling issues of the centralized infrastructure that needs to process, transform, and store big data sets. Blockchain-based decentralized storage infrastructure will simplify cryptographically secure data storage across participatory networks. Thus, technology integration will offer benefits such as enhanced data security, collective decisions making, decentralized intelligence, and high efficiency. Multi-user accounting processes involving stakeholders such as business management, regulators, financial institutions, or government are inherently inefficient by reason for the multilateral authorization of business transactions. The integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain will enable automatic and rapid verification of data-asset-value transfers between different stakeholders. Thus, it is clear that the stakeholders involved in the process (financial advisors, auditors, public and fiscal authorities, shareholders, creditors) will also provide practical solutions to all their needs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Accounting information system; Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Cloud accounting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130800730

Sentiment analysis can aid in the rapid acquisition of concepts from massive amounts of textual data. Using the power of digital technology, sentiment analysis models can be trained to comprehend literature beyond simple notions, read for context, irony, and other elements, and detect the writer's genuine mood and feeling. In today's world, companies may have mountains of customer feedback, and when they're drowning in data, sentiment research can help them figure out what the most serious worries are. Sentiment analysis could be used to focus on user comments that have a significant negative tone. Similarly, we can look at positive client comments to see why they love us. As a result of recent advances in deep learning, algorithm's capacity to analyze text has substantially improved. Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, when used creatively, can be a great tool for conducting in-depth research. The appropriate classifier is chosen by comparing the accuracy of two distinct deep learning-based models: ConvoBiLSTM and ConvoBiGRU, in order to increase classification accuracy. According to the evaluation results ConvoBiGRU perform better when compared to ConvoBiLSTM Model. Large scale e-commerce businesses such as FlipKart, Amazon, and a host of other online marketplaces would be able to obtain the product's polarized interpretation. As a result, their sales revenue rises. Customers believe they are being heard and that their requirements are being met, which improves a company's image. © 2022 IEEE.","ConvoBiGRU; ConvoBiLSTM; Deep Learning; SentimentAnalysis; Word2Vec","Deep learning; Image enhancement; Sales; Comparatives studies; Convobigru; ConvoBiLSTM; Deep learning; Power; Rapid acquisition; Sentiment analysis; Sentimentanalyse; Textual data; Word2vec; Sentiment analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130773097

This study uses Activity Theory (AT) as a theoretical lens to examine AI-powered B2B marketing as a collective activity system, and to illuminate the contradictions that emerge when adopting and implementing AI into traditional B2B marketing practices. AT is appropriate in the context of this study, as it shows how contradictions act as a motor for change and lead to transformational changes, rather than viewing tensions as a threat to prematurely abandon the adoption and implementation of AI in B2B marketing. Based on eighteen interviews with industry and academic experts, the study identifies contradictions with which marketing researchers and practitioners must contend.

In recent years, social media has demonstrated tremendous growth, which has affected individuals, businesses, communities, and economies. The focus of the present study is to identify the impact of social media on geopolitics and economic growth. The study is based on a systematic review of previous literature on the subject. It has been revealed through the findings that social media impacts geopolitics by decreasing the level of censorship and increasing the spread of news or information, while it also enables the politicians to influence individuals over online social networks through the great level of access. On the other hand, it has been identified that social media has both positive and negative impacts on geopolitics and economic growth. Social media is able to unite diverse groups and individuals spread across the planet dedicated to specific issues. The formation of communities and the ability of social media to unite groups show how social media could contribute positively to geopolitics and economic growth. But it decreases the productivity level of the individuals; on the other hand, it does contain the potential to create a participatory economy, which can be beneficial for a particular country. Some argue that social sharing has encouraged people to use computers and mobile phones to express their concerns on social issues without actually having to engage actively with campaigns in real life. Their support is limited to pressing the ""Like""button or sharing content. This study performs a thorough study selection exercise and a quality assessment to ensure that the present study is valuable to academia and the relevant stakeholders, especially the experts of computer science who can develop the smartest artificial intelligence and cognitive computing tools that can help mitigate those risks of social media for the geopolitically volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world and ensure smooth economic growth. © 2022 M.

This technology has the potential to transform many aspects of patient care, as well as management functions within providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies. A growing number of research shows that artificial intelligence (AI) can work better or better than humans in important health care tasks such as diagnostics. As machine learning (ML) models become more common in our daily lives, concerns about their potential for injury are growing. In medicine, optimism in the human-health function of ML is influenced by ethical concerns about the potential of tools to magnify existing health disparities. Recent research, for example, has found that when applied to women, minority races and ethnic groups, as well as those with social insurance, modern clinical prediction algorithms do well. When popular language language models are trained in science textbooks, they complete the templates of clinical notes to compliment hospitals for violent white fathers, according to other studies. CONCLUSION: While in-depth learning as a means of analysis and modelling has some advantages at the moment, it also highlights a major trend: the integration of health sciences with data. Obstacles to access to health care will be higher than many other industries, where billions of people use in-depth learning and other forms of electronic learning software every day. © The Electrochemical Society","AI; Deep learning; dystopian; health care; Machine learning","Clinical research; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Daily lives; Deep learning; Dystopian; Human health; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Management functions; Patient care; Patient management; Pharmaceutical company; Health care",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130578596

This study offers an overview of deepfake technology, and in particular, examines five W questions to better decipher the impact of these tools on organizations: What is deepfake? Who is the fraudster and who is targeted? Why use them and how? And What after? Based on these five W questions, this study provides an in-depth discussion of the two cases identified. Even though this technology has several advantages, this study examines its dark side. Design/methodology/approach: Using comparative analysis, the authors study the only two known and publicized fraud cases by using deepfakes that have targeted chief executive officers to date. Findings: The paper provides an extensive picture of the unethical and illicit use of deepfakes in an organizational context and discusses how this technology could affect fraud risk. In addition, the analysis of cases shows that voice-generating software, combined with other fraud schemes such as business email compromise, facilitates the commission of the fraud, as the victims feel confident because they recognize the speaker’s voice and emails. The analysis shows that any organization could be vulnerable to this technology. The median costs of this type of fraud can be high. For the two cases identified, the estimated losses amounted to US$243,000 and US$35,000,000, respectively. Originality/value: This paper adds new insights to the scarce research on deepfakes and financial crime by investigating the causes and consequences of the unethical and illicit use of deepfakes. It has several implications for organizations, boards of directors, management and regulatory authorities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence-based software; Business email compromise; Cybercriminality; Deepfakes; Fraud; GANs; Generative adversarial networks; Synthetic media; Vishing",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130573473

Plants use evapo-transpiration to pull water from moist soil and release water into the atmosphere at the same time as absorbing nutrients from the soil with water for root zone growth. There is a critical threshold beyond which plants cannot get the nutrients and water they need for growth. The root zone must be supplied with high-quality water before the limit is reached, as a consequence. Species, soil, and climate all influence this limit. Because the threshold cap differs by plant kind. The application of the proper amount of water at the right time and place inside the facility is a requirement of scientific scheduling. Monitoring the soil moisture content at the root zone needs a predetermined irrigation schedule based on the plant's nature, its growth, the kind of soil, and its climatic conditions. As a consequence, sensors near the soil's root zone are required to acquire a representative moisture condition for scientific irrigation scheduling. Deep learning and machine learning are two of the most popular techniques to artificial intelligence. People, companies, and governments all use these models to predict and learn from data. Complex and diverse data sets in the food business need the development of machine learning algorithms. The irrigation system shown here is based on machine learning and the internet of things.

Cloud computing appears to be a promising technology that can help with this optimization by providing infrastructure, platform, and software solutions for the entire supply chain network over the Internet. The use of cloud-based services in supply chain management has financial and operational benefits, but all supply chain stakeholders should be aware of potential dangers and restrictions. Cloud computing can improve supply chain collaboration and infrastructure needs by allowing for more flexible outsourcing of software. Rather than sustaining and paying for maximum use, this technology proposes an approach that allows for flexibility in adding on the way, depending on the entire business process and supply chain network model. Aside from the normal tech hype, cloud computing has the potential to be an ideal technology for supporting and managing a constantly changing and dynamic network, and thus for supply chain management (SCM).

If you want to make better decisions and plan better for your business, you use business forecasting to help you do that. It allows people to figure out important parameters and variables that can be controlled in advance so that management-oriented results can be achieved in the future. In simple terms, business forecasting is the act of predicting or projecting future trends based on company data. Forecasting is becoming more important in today's business world because companies are trying to make their customers happier while also cutting down on the costs of making and selling things and things. When a man runs a business, he has to try to figure out what will happen in the future, and his success or failure is very much dependent on how well he can predict the future. Forecasting tries to cut down on the uncertainty that managers have had to deal with when it comes to things like cost, profit, sales, production, and pricing. This article talks about how machine learning can be used to predict business outcomes. © The Electrochemical Society","Artificial Intelligence; Business Prediction; Machine Learning; Profit Maximization; Sales forecasting","Costs; Machine learning; Profitability; Sales; Business decisions; Business forecasting; Business prediction; Business strategy; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Performances evaluation; Profit maximization; Sales forecasting; Technological change; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130514147

AI has the potential to provide extremely accurate insights for an organization to make better decisions based on collected data. Despite the numerous advantages that may be achieved by AI, the use of AI can be perceived differently by society, where moral and ethical issues may be raised, especially in regards to accessing and exploiting public data gathered from social media platforms. To better comprehend the concerns and ethical challenges, utilitarianism and deontology were used as business ethics frameworks to explore the aforementioned challenges of AI in society. The framework assists in determining whether the AI’s deployment is ethically acceptable or not.

However, the scale of the school is constantly expanding, the number of campuses and departments within the school increases, and the number of teachers and students increases. These new circumstances need the development of an open, secure, and effective school administration system that can operate online at any time and from any location. The ""plan norm model""of educational management decision-making goals controls the decision-making dynamic structure. Whether the decision-making object is an ""economic man""or a ""social man,""its dynamic structure is built on a top-down control sequence, with the only variation being the control mechanisms used. In colleges and universities, educational administration management is an essential aspect of educational management. It is a work with strong timeliness, heavy workload, and high accuracy requirements, affecting the overall situation of teaching. This paper proposes an information integration platform based on SOA, which integrates various enterprise application systems into a unified platform by using a loose coupling structure, realizes information sharing among application systems, and meets the needs of cross-departmental enterprise business. As a new architecture idea, service-oriented architecture can package existing assets and reuse existing assets. It can also minimize the impact of demand changes because its implementation is loosely coupled.

Therefore, a new intellectual business service has become very popular and relevant: “Generalization, weighing and coordination of group expert assessments when making management decisions”. When providing this intellectual service, we face a problem that consists in the absence of an algorithm and available software tools, i.e. a method for solving this problem. Therefore, the aim of the work is to develop a method that provides automated provision of this intellectual service. There is a requirement for the intellectual model on the basis of which this intellectual service will be executed: under the same conditions, to issue the same forecasts and recommendations as the group of experts. The core of the proposed method of achieving the goal is automated system-cognitive analysis. This method belongs to the methods of artificial intelligence and has its own personal-level software tools with a zero entry threshold. The main result of the work is the algorithm (methodology) and available software tools (open source software) that ensure the provision of this new intellectual business service.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been needed by companies of all sizes, whether minor or major, to handle the terabytes of data created by sensing, actuation, production control systems, and web services. These data are large (terabytes) and diverse (picture, audio, video, graphics), necessitating the use of specific models and approaches for analysis and administration. Intelligent technologies create enormous quantities of data in massive industrial networks, hence IIoT frameworks demand clever, resilient big data analysis tools. Because of their cognitive acquisition and processing capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques generate impressive outcomes in IIoT networks. The possibility of machine learning in IIoT applications is assessed in this research study, which also gives a comprehensive topology of IIoT and major enabling technologies. The theoretical underpinnings of numerous well-known ML algorithms, as well as several software and hardware frameworks for ML implementations, are then presented.

It requires the following prerequisites: First, to adopt an Open Innovation 4.0 approach based on the Quintuple Helix Model. Second, to critically reflect on ‘smart-only’ developments as characterized by the ‘Smart Everything Paradigm’ and focus on different design trade-offs when designing future smart environments. Third, to be aware of the lessons learned from moving beyond ‘smart-only’ cities towards humane, self-aware, and cooperative hybrid cities, where ‘self-awareness’ provides a new definition of ‘smartness’. Fourth, to identify the special issues of islands and so called ‘Outermost Regions’ (ORs) addressed in the EU-funded FORWARD project which provided our application context. Based on these prerequisites, we applied the lessons learned from ‘smart-only’ cities to ‘smart-only’ islands, including a semantic extension of the notion of ‘hybrid’ for islands. A transformation and change approach based on participatory design and associated methods provided the foundation for the Island Design Café held on the island of Madeira in October 2021 with active participation of a group of researchers, stakeholders from local businesses and institutions, and people of Madeira. The goal of the Island Design Café was to develop ideas, strategies, and a road map for transforming Madeira into a ‘place to be’ as a Lighthouse of Research and Innovation (R&I).

As we are slowly moving toward retrieval, it is very clear that the business and the way of doing work will change forever in the new normal phase. The experience of Covid-19 has drastically fastened the organization’s digital transformation. Thus, the purpose of our study is to explore the impact of AI-enabled work culture on employees’ satisfaction level post-pandemic. Companies now focus more on data-driven strategies and decision-making, which seems critical today for their business survival and success tomorrow. Few people may argue that technology has always been a part of an organization’s work culture then; what is new? Moreover, the answer will be the overnight shift of work on-site to work from home, leading to a drastic change in the work culture. The situation caused due to covid-19 has forced the employees and organizations to rely fully on technology, which had made the organizations adopt the use of technology as it was never. Organizations today are investing more in digitalization and automation to secure their business ventures in these shifting dynamics. However, how will AI change the dynamics of future work? As the digitalization and use of technology have evolved, AI development has increased the fear of losing their jobs in people’s minds influencing their work satisfaction. Therefore, our paper aims to study the impact of artificial intelligence on the work culture and its effect on employees’ work satisfaction. Moreover, the paper also discusses the related gap found in the skillset of employees and managers to work on AI and other related technologies during the pandemic and the probable solutions. The responses of 150 employees were collected, and the results have concluded that AI-enabled work culture will significantly impact the employees’ work satisfaction post-covid-19. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Automation; Covid-19; Information technology (IT); Work culture; Work from home; Work satisfaction",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130270062

In connection with variable corporate goals such as fluctuating workload, agile responsiveness to customer inquiries, ecological and economic sustainability which require an intelligent and forward-looking management of the company. Hence, a prototype solution has been created to respond to a very dynamic market. Based on Microsoft PowerPoint (ISpring) and with some add-ons pre-selected operators may interact, including with video content. The current architecture of the IT system has already been done. Adjustments will still be made to become more agile and future-driven to follow all of the company business rules. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodical analysis and synthesis approach is followed, for human and other resource input calculation, to follow business KPIs (key performance indicators) and other business goals with an algorithm. This evolution or control system is seen as a natural response to a very complex environment where human effort and error must be minimized (through simplification and a mathematical algorithm and a fast loop e.g., every ten minutes KPIs may be re-calculated according to existing capacity due to availability of equipment and human resources). This holistic approach shortens reaction times to market situations and at the same time minimizes non-value-adding processes. The business roles are determined depending on the culture/size of the company and strategic parameters. The continuously available flexibility in product design and the instability of all resources is of significant importance. After initial research it was found that commercial systems do not have this ability to dynamically and agilely automatically adapt to the given optimum. Instead of isolated partial optimizations, the expected results are compared with the real results in a continuous dynamic simulation and readjusted promptly [1]. This algorithm represents the actual added value, which has a high economic but also humanity advantage, especially in the manufacturing industry. In the future most manufacturing enterprises will have to follow this AI and agile path to competitive advantage vis-à-vis Asian competitors.

They used this approach because their ideology was pragmatic, the problem at hand, was complex and institutional (healthcare discipline), and they needed to understand the problems from both a practitioner and a nonhuman technology process viewpoint. They used the literature review along with practitioner interviews collected at a big data conference. Although they found many problems, they considered these to be already encompassed into the big data five V’s (volume, velocity, variety, value, veracity). Interestingly, they uncovered three new insights about the hidden healthcare artificial intelligence and big data analytics risks; then they proposed solutions for each of these problems. © 2022 by IGI Global.

Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However, output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven decision-making. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AI transparency; Artificial intelligence; employee turnover; human intelligence; local interpretation; machine learning; model explainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130026962

The authors wondered how the technology startups founded by Russians were distributed around the world and how many stayed in the country. This led to a few related issues. In which jurisdictions are tech startups with the Russian origin more comfortable to exist and why, where it is more probable to attract higher investment, in which industries Russian founders create startups? The issue of determining the “Russian origin” of the founder deserves special attention. The authors define it through higher education: if the founder received a Russian higher education, then, regardless of citizenship and nationality, he is considered as a Russian. The study analyzes the educational trajectories of the founders, the connections of headquarters' locations with origins of the founders, the profiles of the founders (age, work experience and other characteristics). The role of universities in the education process of technological entrepreneurs is revealed, including the potential for generating technological entrepreneurs in various regions of the country. The authors conclude that while the absolute amount of investment attracted in Russia is maintained at the same level, its share is falling. The number of technology startups choosing Russia as their main jurisdiction is also decreasing. Results show that success in attracting investment is positively affected by the early experience in launching a startup (university years), as well as by technical education. The authors state the difference in the industry structure of startups created by the Russians from the world average in favor of IT, robotics, and artificial intelligence to the detriment of medicine, trade, and business services. The conclusion is: universities in such cities as St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk are poorly using the potential of generating technological entrepreneurs. © 2022 New Economic Association.

The application of advanced and intelligent approaches successfully helps the enterprises and government find out the valuable information hidden in the massive economic data. This study presents a novel data-driven approach to forecast the short-term business climate using the electric power consumption data of large enterprises. In addition, the climate conditions, interactions between different industries, the business cycle, and some other related variables are also considered and included in the developed forecasting model. To be specific, the business climate prediction model based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed firstly, and the human-simulated particle swarm optimization algorithm (HSPSO) in our previous work is employed to optimize the parameters of the developed forecasting model. Secondly, a novel power-consumption-based business climate index (BCI) system is developed and comprehensively analyzed. The developed BCI system that contains the index for each separate industry (BCI-I), the index for tertiary industry (BCI-T), the index for secondary industry (BCI-S), and the index for the entire province (BCI-P) is proposed. In addition, the developed BCI system is employed to normalize the output of SVM-based forecasting model to directly indicate the business climate, which is very important to the decision-making of enterprises and government under the background of smart cities. Finally, the real data of Guangdong province in China, including the gross output values (GOV) and detailed power consumptions of more than 38000 enterprises, are employed to test the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the GOV of each industry and the whole society predicted by HSPSO-SVM matches the real data well. Moreover, the predicted BCI can directly indicate the business climate in advance, which is of great value for economic-decision and policy-making of both enterprises and government. © 2022 Ji Xu et al.",,"Climate models; Data mining; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Business climate; Climate index; Data-driven approach; Decisions makings; Forecasting models; Indices systems; Output values; Short-term business; Simulated particle swarm optimization algorithms; Support vectors machine; Electric power utilization",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129990118

Since this is an urban area, there is a tendency for people and businesses to converge, which results in higher water demand. At present, the combined distribution efficiency of its water infrastructures under the management and supervision of the Cauayan City Water District (CCWD) is only 87% or with a combined distribution loss of 10%, which is 1282.50m3 losses per day. This study suggests the necessity to introduce new and innovative water management technologies and systems adapted to climate change to address the city's needs. Problems that need to be addressed include a low-efficiency performance of the existing water infrastructure systems, lack of management tools for more efficient delivery of water services, limited service coverage of the water district due to limited water resources, and depletion and contamination of aquifers and other water sources since shallow aquifer is mainly utilized. Hence, a decisionsupport application based on geographic information systems (GIS) for managing urban water infrastructure with Storm Water intervention is a designed solution to address the needs of the city. The combination of decision support systems (DSS) and geographic information systems (GIS) was presented in this paper to maximize and properly utilize water infrastructure. One of the tools used as DSS is MIKE Operation. This is a complete GIS-integrated modeling tool that enables users to make sound decisions and create future concepts for urban storm water systems - cost-effective and resilient to change. A conceptual framework and relevant methodologies were presented as a guide for the success of the designed new technology. © 2022.

Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour. © 2022 Dawood HM et al.","Benefit-Risk framework.; Fintech; Mobile Perceived Trust; Mobile technology acceptance model; Net Valence framework; Perceived Benefit; Perceived Risk","adoption; consumer; human; review; systematic review; theoretical study; trust",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129944024

Public discourse about the practical and ethical implications of AI has mainly focussed on the societal level. There is an emerging knowledge base on AI risks to human rights around data security and privacy concerns. A separate strand of work has highlighted the stresses of working in the gig economy. This prevailing focus on human rights and gig impacts has been at the expense of a closer look at how AI may be reshaping traditional workplace relations and, more specifically, workplace health and safety. To address this gap, we outline a conceptual model for developing an AI Work Health and Safety (WHS) Scorecard as a tool to assess and manage the potential risks and hazards to workers resulting from AI use in a workplace. A qualitative, practice-led research study of AI adopters was used to generate and test a novel list of potential AI risks to worker health and safety. Risks were identified after cross-referencing Australian AI Ethics Principles and Principles of Good Work Design with AI ideation, design and implementation stages captured by the AI Canvas, a framework otherwise used for assessing the commercial potential of AI to a business.

Versioning preserves every version of a dimension record and allows a fact record to reference its associated version of the dimension record correctly. However, major existing versioning practices (utilizing a binary join operator and a union operator) cause processing redundancy in queries joining a fact table and a dimension table. This paper proposes μ -join, an extended join operator that directly accepts a fact table and an arbitrary number of dimension tables, and presents that this operator reduces the redundancy and speeds up fact-dimension joins queries.

To efficiently utilize artificial intelligence (AI), fashion data must be classified. Until now, such data have been classified focusing only on the objective properties of fashion products. Their subjective attributes, such as fashion brand sensibilities, are holistic and heuristic intuitions created by a combination of design elements. This study aims to improve the performance of collaborative filtering in the fashion industry by extracting fashion brand sensibility using computer vision technology. The image data set of fashion brand sensibility consists of high-end fashion brand photos that share sensibilities and communicate well in fashion. About 26,000 fashion photos of 11 high-end fashion brand sensibility labels have been collected from the 16FW to 21SS runway and 50 years of US Vogue magazines beginning from 1971. We use EfficientNet-B1 to establish the main architecture and fine-tune the network with ImageNet-ILSVRC. After training fashion brand sensibilities through deep learning, the proposed model achieved an F-1 score of 74% on accuracy tests. Furthermore, as a result of comparing AI machine and human experts, the proposed model is expected to be expanded to mass fashion brands. © 2022. The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles.

However, there exists limited understanding of the antecedents and outcomes of such an AI-MKS exchange. Research on this topic is timely as emerging research points to mixed (positive and negative) effects of such technological adoption. Therefore, this article employs a dual review strategy, wherein a narrative review follows a systematic literature review to develop a theoretical model for understanding the causes and consequences of an AI-mediated knowledge-sharing exchange using AI-enabled HRM applications. We integrate the theoretical literature on knowledge sharing, HRM, and AI-mediated social exchange for building our theoretical model. Specifically, the systematic literature review points to an individual, social, technological, and organizational level antecedents of knowledge sharing, which interact with various types of an AI-MKS social exchange to deliver high levels of personalization, hyperpersonalization, and individualization for employees as well as deliver HR effectiveness.

Gartner also suggests labelling digital transformation as ‘digitization’ since nationalized establishments use the term digital transformation to mention normal IT practices like usage of online services. Vaughan [2] suggests the main four areas to consider while an organization plan on a digital transformation project as process transformation, business model transformation, domain transformation, cultural/organizational transformation.

Characterized by the strong modeling and computation ability, AI technologies have been applied to many areas in contemporary society. To this end, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology into transportation systems leads to a typical form of intelligent transportation systems: AI-Deployment transportation systems (AID-TS). The AID-TS effectively apply advanced AI technology into transportation, service control, and vehicle manufacturing, in order to strengthen the connections among vehicles, roads, and users. To this end, real-time autonomous transportation systems with considerable efficiency and reliable safety can be formulated. Through the harmonious and close cooperation among people, vehicles, and roads, the AID-TS are able to improve transportation efficiency, alleviate traffic congestion, improve capacity of road networks, and reduce energy consumption. Nowadays, countries represented by Japan and the United States have widely studied application of the AID-TS. At the same time, China is also actively planning its research on AID-TS. Generally speaking, AID-TS will become a wide and meaningful application in the future smart city around the world. From the perspective of system composition, the AID-TS are a kind of complicated and comprehensive systems that can be mainly divided into several subsystems: transportation information service systems, transportation management systems, public transportation systems, and vehicular control systems. Therefore, this chapter is organized via three aspects of contents: 1) review for AID-TS; 2) architecture for AID-TS; and 3) business scenarios for AID-TS. This chapter is responsible for introducing basic conception of AID-TS and is composed of three parts: overview, prevalence, and development status. In this chapter, architecture for AID-TS as well as key technologies is described. From the bottom to the top, the whole architecture can be categorized into three layers: sensing layer, networking layer, and application layer. This chapter describes four typical business scenarios for AID-TS in four parts, containing autonomous transportation management, vehicular control, public transportation scheduling, and transportation information service. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Embedded technology; Global positioning system; Highway traffic safety prevention and control system; Intelligent connected car; Intelligent highway system; Intelligent road traffic management system; Internet technology; Near-field communication; Radio frequency identification; Sensing; Sensors; Traffic signal systems; Transportation management; Transportation science; Urban rail transit; Vehicular control system; ZigBee","Accident prevention; Advanced traffic management systems; Emergency traffic control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Highway administration; Highway planning; Highway traffic control; Information management; Information services; Intelligent systems; Light rail transit; Motor transportation; Network architecture; Network layers; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Traffic congestion; Traffic signals; Urban transportation; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Zigbee; Embedded technology; Highway traffic safety prevention and control system; Intelligent connected car; Intelligent road traffic management system; Intelligent roads; Internet technology; Prevention and controls; Radio-frequency-identification; Road traffic management; Traffic management systems; Traffic signal system; Transportation management; Transportation science; Urban rail transit; Vehicular control; Vehicular control system; Radio frequency identification (RFID)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129625512

The widespread use of information and telecommunications technology is applied in business, government and municipal administration, education, and everyday life. A digital economy can significantly increase productivity by reducing transaction costs. Digital platforms eliminate intermediaries from the value chain and allow for the direct communication of a customer and the manufacturer. The combination of artificial and natural intelligence and the prospects for their interaction are more often discussed in society and science. Smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, smart city, and smart contracts are new technologies that can significantly improve efficiency by reducing transaction costs and eliminating intermediaries from the value chain. The use of IT in spatial development management will make public and municipal administration more transparent and less resource-intensive. The use of robotics and the Internet of Things in the agricultural sector will bring this area of activity to a new level of development, solving the country’s food security problem. The cooperative sector of the economy cannot ignore the global development trends. The use of advanced technology in consumer cooperation will allow reviving the former greatness of this institution and preserving traditional social values, which, unfortunately, are being erased by the industrial machine of the fourth industrial revolution. It is still early to talk about the effects of global digitalization. However, the fact that all sectors of the economy will be transformed and the structure of the labor market will change is now becoming evident.

The current research is an effort to develop an artificial intelligence-based security solution that can meet the SME demands of providing a security solution capable of detecting cyberattacks in real-time before they eventually become a crisis for the business. The proposed solution uses multiple layers of deep neural networks using ReLu activation function and Adam algorithm as an optimizer to provide the detection capabilities. While Wireshark provides the model with powerful network monitoring capabilities, Weka fulfils the data pre-processing role to provide the AI module with a clean and structured dataset. The solution is tested for its ability to study the network patterns and capability to distinguish between the regular and malicious traffic. The proposed model is tested using two different datasets, a dataset created in a virtual lab environment, and an IoT-23 dataset. The performance of the proposed AI model is tested on the metrics of ‘accuracy’ and ‘loss’. The model performed well in distinguishing the network traffic on both the datasets.

The application of information technology such as big data and artificial intelligence can accelerate the development process of intelligent manufacturing. The common problems encountered by small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises is that the information isolated island leads to the non-flow of data, which leads to the low efficiency of business flow. Combined with the actual business data of the enterprise, the intelligent manufacturing data fusion scheme driven by big data is proposed, which opens up the information isolated island from the horizontal and vertical paths, realizes the fusion of business flow and data flow, improves the efficiency, and achieves the real improvement of quality and efficiency.

Therefore, the study's primary purpose is to segment the organic saffron market in Mashhad, Iran using neobehavioristic theory and machine learning methods. Design/methodology/approach: Considering the neobehavioristic theory of consumer behavior, the organic saffron market was segmented using crisp and fuzzy clustering algorithms. Also, to assess the relative importance of the factors affecting the intention to buy organic saffron in each market segment, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the output of the artificial neural network (ANN). A total of 400 questionnaires were collected in Mashhad, Iran in January and February 2020. Findings: In contrast to the belief that psychological factors are more important in market segmentation than demographic characteristics, findings showed that the demographic characteristics of consumers, especially education and income, are the dominant variables in the segmentation of the organic food market. Among the 4 A’s marketing mix elements, the results showed that a low level of awareness and accessibility are obstacles to organic saffron market development. Advertising, distribution channel improvement, package downsizing and online business development are suggested strategies for expanding the organic saffron market in Iran. Practical implications: The results of the present study will help policymakers and suppliers of organic saffron to identify their target markets and design short- and long-term marketing strategies to develop the organic saffron market.

However, taking into account the ever rising demand for new requirements and data dependent human society, it makes sense to move towards the next generation and prepare vision beyond 5G, designing an innovative 6G substrate which will include latest ground-breaking technologies and designs to satisfy new data and connectivity based aspirations of individuals, businesses and societies. Idea of this paper is to provide deep insight into the services, enablers, use cases and technologies of 6G and also motivate researchers to work towards 6G cellular mobile communication network. As a start point gap analysis of 5G is carried out in comparison to 6G, aspirations in relation to data rates, connectivity are taken and a new design is proposed with future use cases. As seen with 5G networks, a technology requires a blend and fusion with other leading technologies of future like 6G will be amalgamated with path breaking technologies like holographic communications, high-precision manufacturing, a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT/IoMT, and the integration of new technologies, such as visible light communication (VLC) or sub-terahertz, in a truly real 3D coverage scenario.

This research study focuses on integrating WSN architecture. In actuality, many automated systems still require extensive human engagement; for example, a patient may need to visit multiple pharmacies in order to locate a specific sort of drug. A smart inventory system integrating Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Quick Response Codes (QR), and cloud services (Web) would solve numerous difficulties while also saving money for both patients and stakeholders. With all these chores, a speedier and more reliable system is required to manage operational and repeatable processes. Recent advancements in the field of portable devices have been substantial, particularly in the area of audio/music information delivery systems such as headphones that link to mobile/portable devices via wired or wireless communication. Usage of headphones connected with mobile devices by all age group people is getting higher practically every day, for doing multiple businesses like navigation, automation, bill payment, contest participation, news and events social media. This paper suggests the usage of four typical home appliances: a fan, a light, a coffee machine, and door alarms, using a single remote. Natural Language processing is used by the mobile device to interpret the user's voice command. To communicate with the Wi-Fi signals provided by these appliances, the project uses a smartphone application. The application gives commands to the Arduino devices and also responds to their responses. While a command is delivered from a remote location. As a result, the integrity and confidentiality of conveyed data, as well as the authentication of the services that provide that data are critical. As a result, security is a vital IoT feature. As a result, it includes a username and password-based authentication mechanism in the mobile application. To assist computers in understanding and responding to commands delivered in natural (human) language.

Machine learning algorithms, especially ensemble algorithms, have shown great economic benefits in enterprise financial early warning. However, the highly imbalanced class distribution of financial risk data and the inexplainable of most machine learning-based early distress warning models limit their commercial application. To address the above limitations, we enhance the business failure prediction performance by tree-ensemble in a boosting manner. Moreover, to solve the class imbalanced issue in business failure datasets, a weighted objective function, weighted cross-entropy, is embedded into the boosted tree framework, making the weighted XGBoost a cost-sensitive business failure prediction model. Besides, to tackle the second issue, we explore the intrinsic interpretability of the proposed method by visualizing the feature importance and incorporating a partial dependence plot technique to locally interpret the individual business failure event. Experimental results on business failure datasets with different predictive horizons collected from China Security Market Accounting Research (CSMAR) database show the proposed weighted XGBoost is a good solution to reduce the error on recognizing firms in business failure. Furthermore, the visualized feature importance score and partial dependence plot result both demonstrate that the cost-sensitive tree-based ensemble can be a good tool to guide the investors in making rational as well as provide interpretable business prediction results as a reference for the policy-making of the regulators. © 2013 IEEE.","Business failure prediction; Cost-sensitive; Interpretability; XGBoost","Adaptive boosting; Artificial intelligence; Bioinformatics; Economics; Forecasting; Learning systems; Bankruptcy; Biological system modeling; Boosting; Business failure; Business failure prediction; Cost-sensitive; Interpretability; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Xgboost; Costs",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129187955

Chatbots allow users to have conversations with the system by asking questions in the way that they would with another human beings. The current adoption rate of chatbots on computer chat platforms is very high. Such robots use artificial intelligence to understand human input and respond accordingly. The core technology for the rise of chatbots is 'Natural language processing' (NLP). The recent advancements in NLP have allowed chatbots to be more receptive than ever. Today, humans can interact with the chatbot systems anytime, anywhere. Chatbots can perform predictive tasks (especially in the medical field), which is now possible with advances in artificial intelligence and data mining technology. Healthcare, agriculture and education are important areas that need the most attention. In today's world, with the change in lifestyle and the current pandemic, illnesses have increased in the general population. As a result, the need for hospitals and doctors have increased substantially. Patients have to spend their time waiting to be taken care of by the doctors. Also, doctors have an immense amount of workload with the amount of visits they have. Thus, the future of healthcare depends on the ability of care providers to perform accurate remote diagnosis. This can be done by collecting data remotely, and by using artificial intelligence to analyse data to improve business and health outcomes.

Many customers leave a review after staying in the hotel. These reviews are mostly given on the website used to book the hotel. These reviews can be considered as a valuable data, which can be analyzed to provide better services in the hotels. The purpose of this study is to use machine learning techniques for analyzing the given data to determine different sentiment polarities of the consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Reviews given by hotel customers on the Tripadvisor website, which were made available publicly by Kaggle. Out of 10,000 reviews in the data, a sample of 3,000 negative polarity reviews (customers with bad experiences) in the hotel and 3,000 positive polarity reviews (customers with good experiences) in the hotel is taken to prepare data set. The two-stage feature selection was applied, which first involved greedy selection method and then wrapper method to generate 37 most relevant features. An improved stacked decision tree (ISD) classifier) is built, which is further compared with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. All the tests are done using R-Studio. Findings: The results showed that the new model was satisfactory overall with 80.77% accuracy after doing in-depth study with 50–50 split, 80.74% accuracy for 66–34 split and 80.25% accuracy for 80–20 split, when predicting the nature of the customers’ experience in the hotel, i.e. whether they are positive or negative. Research limitations/implications: The implication of this research is to provide a showcase of how we can predict the polarity of potentially popular reviews. This helps the authors’ perspective to help the hotel industries to take corrective measures for the betterment of business and to promote useful positive reviews. This study also has some limitations like only English reviews are considered. This study was restricted to the data from trip-adviser website; however, a new data may be generated to test the credibility of the model. Only aspect-based sentiment classification is considered in this study. Originality/value: Stacking machine learning techniques have been proposed. At first, state-of-the-art classifiers are tested on the given data, and then, three best performing classifiers (decision tree C5.0, random forest and support vector machine) are taken to build stack and to create ISD classifier. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Digital information; Hotel reviews; Improved stacked decision tree; Machine learning classifier; Social media; Wrapper feature selection",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129049573

To efficiently respond such challenges organizations must craft strategies to become more data-informed, agile, adaptative, and flexible. Integrating dynamic data analytical models in organizational structures to collect, analyze and interpret business data, is critical to organizations because it enables them to make more data-informed decisions and reduce bias in decision-making. In this work is illustrated the integration of a heuristic project risk-model used to identify project critical success factors into a typical organizational business intelligence architecture. The proposed integration enables organizations to efficiently and in a timely manner identify project collaborative risks by addressing people, environment, and tools, and generate actionable project-related knowledge that helps organizations to efficiently respond business challenges and achieve sustainable competitive advantages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; BI architecture; Digital transformation; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Project risk management",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128956819

The role of intelligent systems for carrying out a system analysis of complex socio-economic objects has been substantiated as a way to increase its objectivity and effectiveness. Emphasis is given on the research of the Russian scientific school of taxonomy, which contributes to the shift of systems analysis technologies towards the systems of “intelligent functioning”. The basic concept of the Systems Analysis Platform is presented, including theory, methodology and tools in a new paradigm. It presents artificial intelligence in three dimensions: “the translated natural intelligence of the subject”; “computer-generated machine intelligence”; “the collective intelligence of the community, formed within the framework of the Internet of things”. Private procedures for formalizing system analysis have been developed: SWOT analysis, morphological analysis, cenological analysis, reconciliation of conflicting interests of business entities of different levels of management.

Usually, tasks are accomplished with low efficiency and high uncertainty, which becomes evident when evaluating the impact introduced by adjustments to these variables. These challenges have led to the appearance of the precision agriculture industry, as farmers attempt to automate the agricultural and commercialization processes using solutions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing. Although these novel technological solutions seem to tackle some of the challenges, several concerns about centralization and data silos throughout the supply chain have arisen. Thus, we propose the Interplanetary Precision Agriculture (IPA) project as an alternative to an increasing demand for better technological solutions in the sustainable food supply, required by the long-term presence of humans in any given environment. The current project aims to improve the cultivation process on and off Earth, by implementing solutions based on the IoT, AI, and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Hence, a “system of systems” is laid out. First, Magrito, a holonomic autonomous rover, is introduced to capture crop performance parameters (output variables). Second, Precision Habitat PRO, the environment controlling device, is deployed to capture growing parameters (input variables). Third, a commercial Bluetooth scale is added.

At the same time, the rapid development of virtualization and cloud computing technologies not only poses a considerable challenge to the endurance of the network, but also causes more and more problems to the traditional network architecture with IP as the core. Cloud computing is a supercomputing model based on the Internet. With the rapid growth of network access and data traffic, the processing power and computing intensity will also increase, and a single server cannot afford the increase in business. In order to reduce network pressure and improve computing efficiency, load balancing for network computing is particularly important. This paper uses ant colony algorithm to design cloud computing load balance. The ant colony algorithm runs in the controller. According to the real-time network load situation provided by the controller, it calculates the link with the smallest load and provides a dynamic data stream forwarding strategy. The result of the experiments shows that the load-balanced ACO optimized technique can significantly provide an improved computational response. In the ACO algorithm, the average response time is about 30% lower than that in other algorithms. This shows that the use of the ant colony algorithm achieves a good optimization effect. © 2022 Jing He.",,"Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Network architecture; Ant colonies algorithm; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Cloud computing technologies; Cloud-computing; Computing load; Load-Balancing; Load-balancing mechanisms; Model-based OPC; Rapid growth; Virtualization computing; Cloud computing; ant colony optimization; article; averaging; cloud computing; Algorithms; Cloud Computing; Computers; Computing Methodologies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128800774

In order for e-retail businesses to continue to grow in an increasingly competitive environment and to stand out from competing businesses, they need to be able to respond to changing consumer demands in a timely and accurate manner. A demand forecasting study using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for the e-retail sector with local supermarkets' data in Turkey (as far as we know) has not been carried out yet. In this study, the demand for a certain category of products was estimated by considering the two-year e-commerce data (website and mobile application) of a local supermarket for the years 2019-2020 and the factors affecting product sales (holidays, CPI value and unemployment rate). Twenty-four different methods of six different artificial intelligence algorithms (Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Gaussian Process Regression, Regression Tree, Support Vector Regression and Ensemble Learning) were used to obtain the best demand forecasting model. The obtained results were evaluated using correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criteria. The best result was obtained using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (RMSE= 0.0353; MAE= 0.0164; R = 0.9742).

Failure to plan AI-CRM technology implementation in an organization could lead some to success and others to failure. The Contingency theory states that it is not possible for organizations to take decisions without a contingency plan and the optimal course of action depends on the internal and external circumstances. The Dynamic Capability View theory emphasizes the organizational ability to react adequately in a timely manner to any external changes and combines multiple capabilities of the organization, including organizational CRM and AI capabilities.

The word ""access control""refers to an organization's policy for authorizing access procedures, the mechanisms that implement and enforce the policy, and the model that the policy and procedures are built on. Adopting new technology may give rise to specific cyber threats that decrease or degrade business operations. The paper has designed to discuss the artificial intelligence-based access control system as a necessary component of governing and safeguarding the financial sector's information assets in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Due to the dynamic and complicated nature of security rules for access control, organizations that employ web-enabled remote access in conjunction with applications access deployed over several networks face various obstacles, including increased operational complexity and monitoring concerns. Organizations spend a vast budget on securing their business. As the industry trend has shifted to intelligent internet-based companies on the same side, the cyber threat has become a challenge for the researcher to find the solution. A systematic research is conducted to fill the gaps in the existing literature by picking the most relevant research papers (126) from the four most reputable online repositories based on the four research questions specified. These research topics aim to evaluate the current situation from many perspectives and provide new avenues for future study to be studied soon to maintain high security and authenticity inside financial sectors of the GCC's countries. © 2022 Habib Ullah Khan et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Finance; Business Process; Cyber threats; Financial sectors; Gulf Cooperation Council; Identity and access managements; Management IS; Organization policy; Process framework; Systematic literature review; User identity; Access control",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128683583

This aspect seems significant even for the European Union, which has already achieved a high level of financial integration due to the introduction of a single currency and the establishment of the European Central Bank. However, this problem is even more topical for countries with a significantly less developed level of integration, including the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The positive effect of financial integration is largely due to financial globalization and digitization of the economy, fintech development, which is a transformative mechanism for coordinating fiscal and monetary policy instruments in financial services, as well as removing barriers to cross-border financial transactions. The purpose of the study is to uncover the prerequisites and trends of financial integration of the EAEU countries amid rapid fintech development and application. The possibilities of its use are revealed by blockchain, Big Data, artificial intelligence, crowdfunding, which can contribute to optimizing customer service, asset management of financial institutions in the domestic market, simplify and increase the speed of information exchange between financial institutions of different countries and the VAT refund process, increase investment flows, develop previously unused business lines, create collective projects and, as a result, contribute to further financial integration and mutually beneficial cooperation. The methodology of the study is based on the synthesis of comparative, structural, expert opinions and statistical analysis methods. Regulatory legal acts of the EAEU and individual countries of the alliance, reports and analytical materials of the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) and central banks of the EAEU countries served as the primary sources of the research. It has been revealed that the introduction of fintech in most of the analyzed countries outpaces the formation of the legal basis. At the same time, it was found that the spread of fintech can assist the implementation of all measures outlined by the Concept of Forming a Common Financial Market of the EAEU countries. Owing to Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, which are more “advanced” in fintech, Armenia and Kyrgyz Republic have the opportunity to achieve a competitive level in this area in a shorter time. © 2022, RUDN UNiversity.

China's economy is currently facing major changes, and with the introduction of the ""Made in China 2025""plan, deepening supply-side reform, and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data technology, the importance of enterprise financial early warning is becoming increasingly prominent. Therefore, by establishing and studying the changes in some financial indicators and establishing an effective enterprise financial early warning model, the signals of financial crisis can be found in time, to prevent and eliminate the hidden danger of enterprise financial crisis and ensure the financial security of the enterprise. The enterprise financial system and business management system are running well. Based on this, a financial early warning model is proposed in this study. First, financial early warning indicators are constructed, and the existing financial indicators are used to establish an early warning indicator system that can detect and identify the financial risks of the enterprise. Then, the financial early warning model based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model and random forest algorithm for fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is constructed using the advantages and noise resistance of the integrated model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model and random forest algorithm. The financial data set is used to verify the model constructed in this study.

So far, literature on these topics has mostly focused on specific DTs and subareas of sustainable product management (SPM). The aim of this paper is to provide a more comprehensive overview of current and potential examples of DT applications in SPM (e.g., product design/assessment, supply chain management, and business models). The collected examples (n = 146) were analyzed based on a systematic literature review, using quantitative and qualitative content analysis. Deductive and inductive analyses of the examples revealed the potential of DTs in terms of their usability along the product life cycle, their role as enablers for circular economy strategies and in specific SPM activities. DT application often entails only incremental improvements, for example, increased efficiency of existing processes, with more radical forms of improvement remaining relatively scarce. There is clear room for greater adoption and optimization of DTs, in various areas of SPM, so as to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy. © 2022 The Authors.

With the support of network technology, its application scale, scope, and depth are constantly expanding. With the explosive growth of data, we are also faced with such a challenge: First, as a basic information storage and management method, database technology can only perform simple data processing, such as query, statistics, reports, etc.; lack of decision-making; analysis; prediction; and other advanced functions. Secondly, in the face of these massive data, people pay more attention to how to dig out the important information hidden in these data, rather than the data itself. Therefore, data mining technology, which integrates statistics, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, and optimization, emerges as the times require. Data mining technology is application-oriented from the very beginning, and its great success in various industries has fully demonstrated its strong vitality, especially in the retail industry. If the data mining technology can be perfectly combined with the retail industry, it can not only bring great convenience to customers but also inject new vitality into enterprises, making them invincible in the fierce competition. This paper proposes a filtering of high-quality customer system framework based on maximum entropy, which expresses customer data as a feature vector for feature selection and feature smoothing. The filtering performance of different feature sets is compared by combining different characteristics of customer data. Experiment and conduct multimedia presentations. Experiments show that the filtration performance of this system is better than the general filtration system. © 2022 Ting Li and Can Zhang.",,"Behavioral research; Competition; Data handling; Data mining; Database systems; Decision making; Digital storage; Pattern recognition; Query processing; Sales; Customer data; Data mining technology; Database technology; Entropy methods; Explosive growth; ITS applications; Management method; Network technologies; Retail business; Retail industry; Information management",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128170751

At present, managers delegate tasks to an artificial agent and rarely consider the customer reception of such decisions. This arouses tensions between the main stakeholders of the organization. This paper shows that the rash adaptation of the digital workforce may be perceived as an irresponsible innovation that brings negative consequences for companies. If a task is regarded by customers as dedicated to humans, and managers delegate it to machines, a new type of conflict – human-machine trans roles conflict (HMTRC), appears. This paper intends to show that customers are sensitive to HMTRC. This research uses quantitative methods and consists of three stages. First, people were asked to indicate which tasks in an organization should be performed by (a) humans and (b) machines. According to these results, two leaflets for customers were designed (low vs. high HMTRC). In the second stage, standard procedures were used to construct a scale measuring customer reactions to HMTRC on three dimensions: cognitive, emotional and behavioural. Ultimately, the scale and two leaflets were used to check how customers react to different intensities of HMTRC. The research results show that customers are aware when HMTRC occurs and perceive it negatively (cognitive response). Moreover, it evokes negative emotions (emotional response) and prompts customers to take action against the company in which this conflict takes place (behavioural response). The practical contribution of this research is the three-dimensional scale. It may predict customers' reactions to task delegation with different intensities of HMTRC and help build a technologically sustainable organization. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","business intelligence; consumer behaviour; consumer perception; fourth industrial revolution; sustainable consumption",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128085964

The work presented in this research constitutes a contribution to modelling and forecasting the demand in a retail sales company, by using time series approach. Our work shows how the historical data of retail items could be utilized to forecast future demands and how these forecasts affect the supply chain management. The historical demand information was used for forecasting future demands using several autoregressive integrated moving average models like AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. By comparing their Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) values we get to know that ARIMA model is best suited for demand forecasting of the current retail item sale data.

Supply chain resilience can be improved by developing business continuity capabilities using artificial intelligence (AI). This research examines how companies use artificial intelligence (AI) and looks at ways that AI can improve supply chain resilience by increasing visibility, reducing risk, and improving sourcing and distribution. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), which is caused by the lethal virus SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus), has become critical especially as the epidemic spreads. X-rays and computed tomography scans are examples of medical imaging that can help in diagnosis. CT scans are preferable over RT-PCR tests because of their inaccuracy. In this era of fast technological growth, using artificial intelligence methodologies to construct models with a higher performance volume and better accuracy predictions is a huge step forward. Medical image analysis incorporating image processing and computer vision techniques were used to analyse the chest Radiographs and train the models. The accuracy and significant amount of data collection and prediction supply chain for efficient detection of COVID-19 utilising Artificial Intelligence techniques are described in this study. Models are built using data obtained by local CT scan centres. The data can be reviewed from time to time in coordination with CT scan centres. The application will provide accurate predictions so this has a significant impact on the tool's market worth. For the post-COVID-19 period, many firms are hastening the creation of management plans with supply chain transformation in mind. In this pandemic, but even so, the market will be even narrower, so without using a decentralised governance framework with an imbalanced structure among various markets, it really should be moved to a centralised management strategy that combines advantage of the existing strength of a blocked setup, with almost as much vicinity to the manufacturing countries and regions. In a stronger emphasis Supply Chain Management, value management, in value analysis, plays a significant role. Real-time raw data of chest CT scans from hospitals were considered and used it to train the model after pre-processing it. In a chest CT scan, multiple perspectives and organs are focused, but the work solely used the axial perspective of the lungs to prepare the dataset. Around 1900 photos of each COVID and Normal are included in the dataset. The data was pre-processed with a range filter for noise reduction, cropping, data augmentation, and other minor operations such as adjusting the image brightness and sharpness. Deep Learning algorithms are trained using this pre-processed data. VGG16, ResNet101, Inception v2, DesneNet169, and Mobile net are implementations of deep learning algorithms that is developed. The same dataset was used to train the above models, however because each model has a distinct architecture, the accuracy of the models varies slightly. The test dataset for all of the models includes 300 images in each class, and the findings demonstrate that DenseNet169 has the best accuracy among the models, while ResNet101 has the poorest. Furthermore, the medical image analysis of Covid-19 by several models aids in the selection of the most accurate model for COVID-19 predictions from CT scans. A windows application for the prediction of COVID has been developed where the user will upload the CT scan image and has an option to specify model and get the prediction. If tested positive, user can also view the infected area in the image. This application uses DenseNet169 as default model, in case user does not specify the model, as it performs the best. The user can view the COVID protocols and related queries from WHO website using a query button. The availability of CT scans and other commodities for this application varies as a result of the pandemic, which has an impact on the global supply chain and the market price of this tool. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","AI; Computer vision; Deep learning; DenseNet169; Inception V2; Mobile net; ResNet101; Supply chain management; Transfer learning; VGG-16",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128083513

Developing a product, distributing it to suppliers, delivering to customers, collecting feedback, etc., all are tracked and maintained using supply chain management. A secured supply chain should be held to ensure that fake products do not enter into the market. For example; if counterfeit drugs enter the market, then it will have various side effects on patients as well as it will affect the pharmaceutical companies. Hence, a secure supply chain is a must. The significance of SCM has increased as it plays a vital role in the decision-making process. Hence, a proper supply chain should be maintained along with a technology which will also help in the decision-making process. One such technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the technology in which machines are programmed to think like humans and perform an action accordingly. Machine Learning can be used in detecting fake products that enter the market. Also, there are various algorithms in AI which can be used in the decision-making process. As the digitalization of SCM is significant, similarly, its security is also worthwhile. SCM can be implemented as a Drug Supply chain Management system, which Blockchain can be integrated to counter the supply of counterfeit drugs into the market by tracking. This chapter discusses Digitalized and AI-based Drug Supply Chain Management.

One of the big potential supporting technologies is the artificial intelligent. Artificial intelligent could help drilling engineers and operation crew in crunching the massive amount of drilling data converting them to decision-like format, leading to safer, faster and more cost effective operations. The challenge is that artificial intelligent projects consists of multi dimension tasks, starting from data handling, infrastructure building, through model development and integrating with existing environment. Such tasks confuses even IT teams, so developing artificial intelligent projects targeting drilling domain will be very tough. Experience shows that a lot of oil & gas artificial intelligent projects fails due to miscommunication between the business domain experts and the artificial intelligent, not having common understanding, problem in the data, or model computability issues could be also other reason for such failure. This paper propose a methodology that will increase the possibility of having success artificial intelligent drilling project.

Here we present an integrated approach to the digitalization of an O&G plant aiming to offer operator safety enhancement, production optimization and reduction of the environmental impact to maximize the asset value. This has been accomplished by complex and continuous work powered by the people who are the engine and the real target of the digital transformation process. In the key study hereby presented, an all-round effort has been made to empower the operator's everyday work with digital and innovative tools supporting reservoir, maintenance, production and HSE workflow. Starting from a number of various legacy systems, a single integrated dashboard was built: The Integrated Operation Centre (IOC). IOC is now available on PC and smartphones to all site personnel both at the operational and managerial level. New innovative systems were developed and deployed into IOC to capitalize on the data acquired during years of plant activities. Machine learning and advanced analytics solutions provide new daily insight on how to efficiently schedule maintenance operations and avoid off-specs and downtime on critical equipment, while complex production optimizers help technicians react to unexpected situations and maximize production. Via IoT (Internet of Things) and portable devices, new tools and workflows were deployed onsite to ease the work and enhance the safety of workers with focus on usage of PPE and providing rapid information to locate workers during emergency situations. People from both site and company headquarters ensured the success of the digital transformation by working together in an Agile Method during the development phase and by coaching in the roll-out phase. New professional roles, like data scientist and big data engineers, joined effort with experienced operators to ensure the success of this journey. This cooperation was at the basis of a comprehensive change management effort, which ensured a smooth and constant change in the way the personnel thinks, acts and reacts. This, we believe, is at the very heart of any fundamental transformation, being it digital or not.

Several initiatives were applied to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of drilling operations. One of the frequent difficulties that faces these operations is unexpected drilling troubles that take place and stops the operation, resulting in losing a lot of time and money, and could lead to safety issues culminating in a fatality situation. For that, the industry is in continues efforts to prevent drilling troubles. Part of these efforts is utilizing the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to identify troubles in advance and prevent them before maturing to a serious situation. Multiple approaches were tried in the past. However, errors and significant deviations were observed when comparing the prediction results to the actual drilling data. This could be due to improper design of the artificial intelligent technology or inappropriate data processing. Therefore, searching for dynamic and adequate artificial intelligent technology and encapsulated data processing model is very essential. This paper presents an effective data-mining methodology to determine the most efficient artificial intelligent technology and the applicable data processing techniques, to identify the early symptoms of drilling troubles in real-time. This methodology is CRISP-DM that stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. This methodology consists of the following phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and Deployment. During these phases, multiple data-quality techniques were applied to improve the reliability of the real-time data. The developed model presented a significant improvement in identifying the drilling troubles in advance, compared to the current practice. Parameters such as hook-load and bit-depth, were studied. Actual data from several oil fields were used to develop and validate this smart model. This model provided the drilling engineers and operation crew with bigger window to mitigate the situation and resolve it, prevent the occurrence of several drilling troubles. In addition to significant time and cost savings, CRISP-DM provided the artificial intelligent experts and the drilling domain experts with a framework to exchange knowledge and increase the synergy between the two domains significantly, leading to a common and clear understanding, and long-term successful drilling and AI teams collaboration. The novelty of this paper is the introduction of data-mining CRISP methodology for the first time in the prediction of drilling troubles. It enabled the development of a successful artificial intelligence model that outperformed other models in predicting drilling troubles.

Digital transformation is the reimagining of business in the digital age. A radical rethinking of how an organization uses technology, people, and processes to fundamentally change business performance is referred to as digital transformation. Digital transformation, on the other hand, starts and ends with how you think about and engage with customers. With digitalization on our side, we have the opportunity to reimagine how we do business, how we engage our customers as we move from paper to spreadsheets to smart applications for managing our businesses. Digital technology has pervaded nearly every industry, and concepts such as Big Data, Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital transformation now figure prominently in discussions of current and future trends. In particular digital transformation refers to the idea of extensive restructuring of operations in organizations, business agencies, and other entities to incorporate technological innovations that completely reshape the approach to the processes. Although interest in digital transformation has recently extended from practitioners to scholars, the academic literature on digital transformation is still rather limited.

At the same time, the state has also given strong support to people's entrepreneurship, encouraging capable people to start their own businesses in terms of policies and funds, which has stimulated a wave of entrepreneurship among the people. However, due to the short period of time for the construction of China's market economy system, the vast majority of new ventures cannot obtain sufficient resource stock to grow and develop and can only turn to the external market to seek opportunities for development. Entrepreneurial bricolage has become a ""keyword of the times""in recent years under this background. Previous studies have shown that entrepreneurial bricolage has a relatively positive effect in alleviating the plight of enterprise development resources, and many new ventures regard it as an important way to obtain development resources. The development of big data and artificial intelligence decision-making provides more possibilities for information sharing and personalized analysis and also gives new ventures more opportunities to choose development resources that suit their own characteristics. However, from the actual situation, it is obvious that Chinese enterprises have not achieved very obvious results in how to make full use of big data and artificial intelligence decision-making technology to improve their entrepreneurial and bricolage capabilities. Based on the technical support provided by big data and artificial intelligence decision-making, this research studies the entrepreneurial bricolage activities of China's new ventures in this context, through the questionnaire survey and tracking analysis of 135 enterprises established in the two provinces from 2015 to 2020. After comparative analysis of a large amount of data, it is found that enterprises that combine big data and artificial intelligence technologies can obtain more high-quality resources and make more informed decisions in the process of starting a business. It can be concluded that the companies that have excellent application of big data and artificial intelligence decision-making technology have more opportunities to obtain ideal resources in entrepreneurial bricolage. The study conducted an in-depth analysis of the problems of China's new ventures in entrepreneurial bricolage and put forward suggestions for improvement based on the specific conditions of this type of enterprise. It is hoped that it can help start-ups to realize the alleviation of resource constraints. © 2022 Xi Kang and Yijun Zeng.",,"Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Quality control; Surveys; China markets; Decisions makings; Development resources; Intelligence decision; Large companies; Making technology; New ventures; Production environments; Short periods; Social life; Big data",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127877265

It is noted that the main significance of this concept is the ability to quickly process large amounts of information, to join together the interests of managers, businesses and the population, and to calculate the current and future demands of an area and its consumer groups within the selected positive growth scenario. An example of such solutions is the “living urban technology labs”, where the situation in a specific area is assessed using artificial intelligence and ICT development, and this assessment is then used to design urban landscapes with affordable housing, healthcare services, including telehealth, as well as traffic control and other sectors. Researching the role of information and communications technology in the development of a territory based on designing “smart cities” suggests a need to: 1) assess the role of the smart city concept in transforming territories based on adopting information and communications technology; 2) validate the possibilities of Russian regions where megapolises are the driving force in the positive transformation of the socio-economic system of a territory on a digital basis to provide an information and communications infrastructure. In Russia, the driving forces in the development of the smart city concept are modern large cities, in the majority of which initiatives on positively transforming the planning and management strategy for a smart urban environment are being carried out. With their developed ICT, they help generate the growth of their local region, contributing to its transformation into a smart territory. Foreign experience concerning both local examples of renovating industrial regions of urban areas as well as scaling the smart city concept within the framework of interregional projects similar to the experience of China can be demanded and tested in Russia, above all, in regions with the most developed ICT today. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Concept scaling; Development drivers; Information and communications technology; Megapolises; Smart cities; Smart territories","Economics; Medical computing; Population statistics; Urban planning; Amount of information; Concept scaling; Development driver; Driving forces; Information and Communication Technologies; Large amounts; Megapolises; Paper analysis; Scalings; Smart territory; Smart city",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127856958

Automatic vacuum cleaners or robot vacuums change the field of vacuum cleaners with an involvement of an automation, which is a technology that makes people’s daily life easier and more economical. Robot vacuums were invented by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990. Today, robot vacuums are successful and have many users all around the world. More than 2.5 million families live in 60 countries use them. However, a question that is still being asked about robot vacuum is the efficiency of room coverage and the ability to remember the redundant areas that have already been cleaned. The answers to these questions are unclear, as manufacturers do not reveal the algorithms that are learned by robots, or sometimes they just partially did, due to business reasons. This study was proposed in response to the above questions by using our mobile application for tracking and recording actual geolocations of the robot walking across various points of the room by extracting the real geolocation data from satellites consisting of a latitude and a longitude under multiple different room conditions. Once the robot has cleaned throughout the room, the application reported all areas that the robot has cleaned for analysis purpose. We presented the actual route map, the coverage area map, and the duplicate area map of the robot that potentially led the further understanding of robot vacuum’s effectiveness. © 2022, EasyChair.

IoT considers the integration of business process models or process execution with resources of intelligent devices. The concept of process meta store (PMS) [1] optimizes the interactions between IoT devices and business processes. However, the mechanism of PMS highly depends on the meta-information of the system, associated devices, and interactions among them. In this context, a novel semantics of metainformation of process store (MIPS) for IoT-based applications is proposed in this paper. The semantics of various MIPS elements and their relationships are described using a class diagram. Further, a B+ tree-based indexing approach for the MIPS semantic is presented for efficient searching of meta-information. The semantics of MIPS are illustrated using the case study related to the clinical decision support system (CDSS). Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis has been carried out to show the expressiveness of MIPS.

One area where humans are still in the center and where the ideas of Industry 4.0 have hardly been implemented is the construction industry, in particular the area of construction machinery. Progressive digitization could here (i) avoid dangerous and health-endangering situations, (ii) make work more attractive, make it easier or (partially) automate it, and (iii) create additional business areas. To meet these challenges, new concepts for human-machine interaction systems must be developed that bring the digital construction site closer and make work safer and more efficient. As a first step in this direction, this paper presents an approach for the remote control of an excavator. Besides the actual control, the focus is on which user interface components are needed for efficient and safe control. For this purpose, we present the results of a user study conducted within the framework of the Human Centered Design approach.

The solutions on the market are aimed specifically at gathering data, rather than processing and analyzing them. Poultry farming is one of the fields, where the application of Industry 4.0 principles is becoming a necessity, especially in the case of greenhouse gas control. Minimum standards and rules in the poultry management are regulated by EU Directives and required parameters must be ensured at all times, therefore, real-time environmental monitoring must be performed. The only practically viable approach is to automate data gathering using appropriate sensors, which is only possible if a standardized data structure model is defined. In this research the Cyber-Physical Model is the proposed as a basis to development of smart poultry farm management system that is adjustable to particular production needs. Three main data groups are defined - necessary data to ensure requirements of EU Directives, farm monitoring data for business analysis and optimization, and additional data that can influence overall poultry farm management. The proposed data set was implemented into the existing infrastructure of a Baltic poultry farm. Multiple CO2(carbon dioxide) and NH3(ammonia) sensors were installed in order to gather data, measurements of which previously were taken manually by the farm's staff. The solution was developed on centralized cloud-based data processing system, where MQTT Broker was used for security measures. The processed data is used by the decision support system with the aim to define optimal feeding and housing. © 2022 The Authors.

The application of performance management in state-owned firms promotes employee motivation and skill development, as well as the development of innovative thinking. Performance effect, therefore, on the role of management in the state-owned enterprise development is bigger, especially because of the influence of traditional human resources performance management mode. The further development of state-owned enterprise resource management work affected the operation and management of state-owned enterprises. Therefore, state-owned enterprises must further optimize the path of performance management, to achieve its fine development. In view of this, this paper deeply analyzes the problems existing in the current performance management of state-owned enterprises and puts forward optimization methods for the problems, aiming at providing help for the optimization of the performance management of state-owned enterprises. In essence, a value network is a value symbiosis system between firms that involves resource sharing, value cocreation, risk sharing, and benefit win-win situations. The formation and development of value network not only extremely change the industrial structure and mode of production, but also have an important impact on enterprise innovation mechanism. Enterprise innovation under the value network system has become the focus of academic and business circles. With the rapid development of machine learning and internet of things (IOT) technologies, as well as China's urbanization, China's agriculture is embracing new development opportunities. Using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to effectively mine agricultural big data and realize effective control and management of intelligent agriculture has become a research hotspot and difficulty. Based on recurrent neural network (RNN) and IOT technology, this paper proposes an enterprise network innovation performance management path optimization system. © 2022 Bing Luo.",,"Agriculture; Human resource management; Information management; Internet of things; Recurrent neural networks; Employee motivation; Employee skills; Enterprise development; Enterprise networks; Innovation performance; Internet of things technologies; Network innovations; Performance management; State owned enterprise; Value network; Risk management",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127719781

It is viewed as a result of the large-scale use of digital technologies in the mode of modern integration processes in the international space in order to enhance economic progress. Based on this goal, we reveal the degree of influence of the generation of digital technologies on the transforming factor of economic growth. They tend to argue that digitalization has become a critical necessity in all spheres of the economy, which is the basis for long-term success. Analyzing the use of digital technologies as a “core” of interaction between science, business and government, we prove the inevitability of economic growth, an increase in the quality of human life and the prosperity of society.

The amount of historical data generated from drilled wells over the past decades of operations is currently being digitized and processed to provide operators with the option to make more informed decisions based on previous experiences that current staff may not be aware of due to the constant loss of experience during industry downturns. The industry is combating this loss of experience through the innovative use of digitalization, integrated operations, and automation. Real time support centers operating under integrated operations business model are now utilizing digital twins (high fidelity models of the ongoing process being supported) to run forecasting simulations and compare results to digitalized historical data with the help of artificial intelligence and expert systems to aid with decision making and training junior staff. The existence of high-fidelity models, and digital twins is a solid foundation for automation.

However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1–12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61–86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from Facebook. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation’s economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees’ autonomy, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations. © 2022, The Author(s).","AI ethics guidelines; AI governance; Artificial intelligence; Big tech; Trustworthy AI; Whistle-blowing","Artificial intelligence; Ethical technology; AI ethic guideline; AI governance; Big tech; Facebook; Google+; Policy makers; Qualitative analysis; Trustworthy AI; Whistle blowers; Whistle-blowing; Personnel training",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127426671

Our findings show that organisations need to look beyond technical resources, and put their emphasis on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and AI-employee integration strategies, to benefit from AI adoption. Based on these findings, we contribute five research propositions to advance AI scholarship in HRM. Theoretically, we identify the organisational resources necessary to achieve business benefits by proposing the AI capability framework, integrating resource-based view and knowledge-based view theories. From a practitioner's standpoint, our framework offers a systematic way for the managers to objectively self-assess organisational readiness and develop strategies to adopt and implement AI-enabled practices and processes in HRM. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","AI capability; AI-employee collaboration; Artificial intelligence; Human resource management; Organisational resources; Systematic review",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127325455

Since the financial crisis prediction (FCP) process is mainly based on data driven decision making and intelligent models, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are widely utilized. This article introduces an intelligent feature selection with deep learning based financial risk assessment model (IFSDL-FRA). The proposed IFSDL-FRA technique aims to determine the financial crisis of a company or enterprise. In addition, the IFSDL-FRA technique involves the design of new water strider optimization algorithm based feature selection (WSOA-FS) manner to an optimum selection of feature subsets. Moreover, Deep Random Vector Functional Link network (DRVFLN) classification technique was applied to properly allot the class labels to the financial data. Furthermore, improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (IFFOA) based hyperparameter tuning process is carried out to optimally tune the hyperparameters of the DRVFLN model. For enhancing the better performance of the IFSDL-FRA technique, an extensive set of simulations are implemented on benchmark financial datasets and the obtained outcomes determine the betterment of IFSDL-FRA technique on the recent state of art approaches. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Digitalization is becoming a powerful driver of economic development. The use of information technologies creates an additional impetus to its dynamics, that affects the improvement of the quality of life of the population. Nevertheless, there are a number of socio-economic risks of the universal digitalization process that must be taken into account when forming a digital transformation strategy of a company. In modern conditions, developing preventive measures to minimize the negative consequences of digitalization, companies need to build up digital competencies and apply risk management. The authors specified the concept of the digital transformation. The definition was expanded with modern digital solutions related to mobility, contractor relations and business development. The segmentation of organizations introduced in the paper by the scale of the implemented digital transformation measures should help managers to navigate the main way in economic security protection and the choice of the introduced competencies for effective risk management. The paper develops a set of measures aimed to eliminate threats to economic security and structures enterprise threats associated with the most common flaws in the security of web applications. Paper recommends that risk management activities should be focused on ensuring an adequate level of protection against economic threats.

Design/methodology/approach: Sociology of expectations framed the theoretical considerations. The explorative research design presents an anonymous qualitative online survey. Respondents represent the Hungarian AI Coalition with a quarter of the members. Findings: The key finding is a controversial result. Although AI is interpreted as a decision-supportive and problem-solving technology for the economy, uncertainties and fears for the society are clearly formulated. Interpreting the results and the originality of the paper, trust building and responsibility sharing in cross-industrial collaborations are fundamental to reduce social uncertainties, override the popular or science fiction narratives and increase the future well-being. Research limitations/implications: The length of textual responses did not allow a deeper analysis. However, for professional reasons, participants were committed to completing the survey. Practical implications: The paper suggests for business and policymaking to identify the AI technology as a tool distinguishing from tech-owners’ responsibilities.

Case overview/synopsis: It was late April 2021, and Mr Srinivas Rao, the co-founder and director of Mentorrd EduTech, India, was contemplating the journey of more than five years. Much had changed since the startup Mentorrd Education Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Mentorrd EduTech) was launched in 2015. From being an online artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for analyzing and building resumes, Mentorrd expanded to specialized premium services for career development catering to MBA aspirants from India to international markets. However, during the same time, many problems had also started showing up. The competition had increased, and conversions became difficult. Mentorrd generated 95% of its leads through Google Ads pay per click (PPC) advertising. However, now, the increased competition made PPC costlier, where Mentorrd started at INR 10 per click but was now paying INR 50 per click. The customers also were only limited to searching for keywords; hence, actual lead conversion was minimal. Mentorrd was present on different social media platforms and had developed an audience: LinkedIn (close to 10,000 followers), Facebook (1,600+ followers) and Twitter (numbers), but conversions from there were only contributing to 5% of the total revenue.Mr Rao wondered that with a change in demand from general review services to specialist resume and interview preparation services such as MBA, he would have to develop a sound social media strategy integrated with the current Google Ads usage to reach the audience and generate conversions. He had a limited marketing budget which he wanted to use most effectively but was not sure how to spend across platforms. Complexity academic level: This case can be used as an IMC strategy case for MBA courses in marketing. In a marketing course, the focus should be on components of IMC strategy, customer perception, company positioning and marketing channels. The case can also be applied as a strategy case for courses in entrepreneurship or digital marketing strategy. In an entrepreneurship course, the focus should be on the business model, growth and scaling decisions a startup needs to make to grow the business. In a digital marketing strategy course, the focus should be on social media marketing and search engine marketing decisions and the implications for revenues and profits. The case can also be used in executive-level courses to illustrate IMC, growth and digital marketing strategies for a startup.

Modern technology represented by artificial intelligence has broad application prospects and significant potential and has the ability to innovate and enhance the conventional marine ranching business that is currently in recession. The particularity of China's marine ranching industry determines the combination of technologies such as underwater robots and the Internet of Things with the development of marine ranching to create a sustainable intelligent marine ranching industry in China. The growth of China's national economy is largely influenced by the development of the country's financial services industry. In order to better support the development of the real economy, it is necessary to establish a financial service system with controllable risks and complementary activities. This paper proposes to use the method of Internet of Things data collection combined with sensors to conduct economic analysis. By taking a number of data in recent years for research and analysis, the results show that financial service industry innovation has become an important part of improving the competitiveness of the industry and an important driving force for economic growth. The Internet of Things (IoT) business in China is a fast-growing industry with huge potential. From the perspective of international comparison, our country is currently in the early stage of the development of the Internet of Things, and a certain technology, industry, and application foundation has been established in the early stage of development. In the financial services business, the visual tracking provided by IoT technology has innovative potential. Introducing IoT technology into financial service business and identifying the driving force and process of financial innovation have practical significance for accelerating financial innovation. © 2022 Tao Liu and Fan Wu.",,"Agriculture; Competition; Internet of things; Collaborative innovation; Data collection; Driving forces; Financial innovation; Financial service; Financial services industries; Human being; Innovation methods; Internet of things technologies; Service business; Data acquisition; artificial intelligence; human; industry; information processing; technology; Artificial Intelligence; Data Collection; Humans; Industry; Internet of Things; Technology",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127043408

This article uncovers the determinants influencing emerging technology adoption, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies (DLT), in South African (SA) financial services firms. Design/methodology/approach: Seventeen technology experts from the SA banking, insurance, financial technology and financial regulation and compliance sectors were interviewed. A semi-structured interview was used to conduct one-on-one interviews, followed by a focus group interview. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic network analysis. Findings/results: The results revealed that the determinants - adopter traits, technology usability, industry characteristics, organisational leadership and organisational characteristics - were influential towards technology adoption. It is suggested that the new model could be strengthened further by incorporating a new construct, leadership diversity, which had not been previously proposed in the literature. Practical implications: By understanding the influential adoption determinants, leaders can take bold, calculated risks in adopting AI, cloud computing and DLT. However, the importance, prior to adopting these technologies, of clearly understanding the need for them, and their business benefits is also emphasised. Originality/value: Research on the adoption of AI, cloud computing and DLT in the SA financial sector is limited. This article leverages the models of the diffusion of innovations (DOI), the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) and the technology readiness index (TRI) to propose a new model that illustrates technology adoption in the SA financial sector at individual and firm levels. © 2022 Sabinet.

Box 392, Pretoria, South Africa","Traditional airport business models of state-owned and regulated airports rely on aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue streams using standard technologies. Aeronautical revenue is derived from airline landing and parking fees as well as passenger fees while non-aeronautical revenue is derived from property rentals, car parking charges, retail concessionaires, car rental companies, and so forth. Traditional business models limit the revenue streams for airport profits and while Airport 4.0 business models have been proposed, traditional business models for airports remain in use, following a low-cost business model. The wake of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) holds much promise for the airport industry to rejuvenate their business models and create a larger profit margin on the way to becoming a smart aerotropolis. This article formulates a set of qualitative propositions through an analyses of business model innovations (BMIs) and 4IR theories, amongst other, smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), BMI and technology roadmapping. On the strength of the said propositions a framework for business model innovation for smart aerotropoli is developed. The framework is validated via considerations from Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) as part of their endeavor to improve on the value proposition for customers. Future work in this area will follow a longitudinal research time horizon by validating and enhancing the framework during the unfolding of the ACSA plan for South African aerotropoli. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aerotopoli; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Business Model Innovation (BMI); Internet of Things (IoT); Philosophy of technology; Smart city; Technology roadmapping",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126931570

AI can introduce new sources of growth, change how people work and improve the effectiveness of their work. Consequently, implementing AI systems in healthcare can enable the optimisation of healthcare resources, facilitate a better patient experience, improve population health, reduce per capita costs, and improve the satisfaction of health professionals. Nowadays, most studies have focused on the potential benefits and barriers to implementing AI in healthcare, while only a few have explained the rational decision-making process for deploying new technologies in the healthcare system. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating how AI supports the effective and efficient management of the healthcare system by examining the Humber River Hospital in Toronto using the case study methodology. To achieve the desired benefits from the process of implementing technology in healthcare, our key findings show that hospitals need to undergo a business transformation that exploits technology. Finally, we conclude that only effective knowledge of technology will enable hospitals to effectively become technological and digital. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business transformation; Healthcare; Innovation; Skills; Technology","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Cost reduction; Decision making; Hospitals; Administrative process; Business transformations; Clinical risks; Healthcare systems; Innovation; New sources; Patient care; Reduce costs; Skill; Technology; Health care",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126895681

Under this new business model, commercial banks and other financial institutions can realize safer and more convenient financial services such as payment, financing and asset management through the application of IoT technology and communication network technology. In the cloud computing model, the local terminal device of IOT will transmit the collected data to the cloud server through the network, and the cloud server will complete the data operation. Cloud computing model can well solve the problem of poor performance of IoT devices, but with the increasing number of IoT terminal devices and huge number of devices accessing the network, cloud computing model is constrained by network bandwidth and performance bottleneck, which brings a series of problems such as high latency, poor real-time and low security. In this paper, based on the new industry of IoT finance which is developing rapidly, we construct a POT (Peaks Over Threshold) over threshold model to empirically analyze the operational risk of commercial banks by using the risk loss data of commercial banks, and estimate the corresponding ES values by using the control variables method to measure the operational risk of traditional commercial banks and IoT finance respectively, and compare the total ES values of the two.

To be able to implement these advanced techniques requires, first, a comprehensive and non-trivial process to identify understandable patterns from data. Within this process, the main difficulty is to identify valid and correct data for the analysis from the different sources in the company. Second, efforts must be developed to create analytic models that provide value by improving performance. Third, a cultural change has to be embraced for companies to facilitate the implementation of the analytical results. In addition to this, since accumulation of data is too large and complex to be processed by traditional database management tools (the definition of “big data” in the Merriam–Webster dictionary), new tools to manage big data must be taking into consideration. In this Chapter, interesting examples of the use of different predictive analytics techniques in emerging business processes will be presented.

Network administrators and vendors are now moving beyond conventional Intrusion-Detection Systems (IDS), that only identify problems after they have occurred, to a novel, constructive approach termed Artificial Intelligence (AI) based intrusion detection system. Conventional network Intrusion Detection Systems and firewalls are usually preconfigured to spot malicious network attacks. Now-a-days attackers have become profounder and can try evading common detection rules. There are a few targeted areas where Artificial Intelligence will distribute the extreme evolution for Cybersecurity. To design a proactive defence mechanism, the system has to understand the intelligence of threats that are currently targeting the organization. The implementation of Machine Learning (ML) and threat intelligent-based solutions into blend can revolutionize the landscape in cyber security industry against any kinds of network attacks. Machine Learning is an application of AI that uses a system which is capable of learning from experience. Even in the era of extremely large amount of data and cybersecurity skill shortage, ML can aid in solving the most common tasks including regression, prediction, and classification. In this chapter, the origin and evolution of IDS has been described, followed by the classification of IDS. This chapter will provide a truly interactive learning experience to help and prepare the researchers for the challenges in traditional IDS and the contributions of ML in IDS. This comprehensive review briefs the prominent current works, and an outline of the datasets frequently used for evaluation purpose.

It is generating many patients waiting for beds in the emergency service. The PMU does not have a business intelligence (BI) platform that provides information in real-time, generating a blind browsing problem. The purpose is to demonstrate the need for a BI platform using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze in real-time the relevant information for decision making. The methodology consists of analyzing qualitative and quantitatively the statistics of the last three years, both from the emergency service and from the clinical services. This study shows that the saturation of the emergency service responds to the number of patients waiting for beds, which interferes with outpatient care. The projections for 2020 underestimated the demand, and the efforts to open hospital beds and home hospitalization quotas allowed to shovel said excess demand. The average stay numbers continue to increase, as does the number of hospitalized patients for emergencies, generating a progressive growth in demand. It is necessary to have a BI system adapted with AI to perform real-time analysis of the GRD, to be able to act during hospitalization and not afterward. © 2022 Abdulsattar Abdullah Hamad et al.",,"Decision making; Diagnosis; Hospital beds; Hospitals; Information analysis; Learning systems; Business groups; Business Intelligence platform; Business-intelligence; Clinical services; Learning methods; Management unit; Patient care; Patient management; Process approach; Real- time; Emergency services",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126356685

This paper also aims to provide information on the emerging trends and implications of the abovementioned relationships by focusing on these relationships and interactions. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study used the close-ended questionnaire approach based on the resource-based view and socio-materiality theories. This included sending questionnaires to top-level management, including Chief Financial Officer/Chief Executive Officers/Chief Information Officers (CFO/CEOs/CIOs), having an in-depth understanding of the concepts, practical applications and usage of big data as well as BDAC.181 valid questionnaire-based responses were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modelling technique and bootstrapping moderated mediation method. Findings: This study provides empirical insights into how BDAC impact innovative performance through PODC as well as the moderating effects of OC and management accountants. This involves a shift in focus from almost standardized approaches to developing BDAC without contextual focus on approaches that are much more heterogeneously related to each organization and hence are more focused on the context of the pharmaceutical industry. Research limitations/implications: The main aim of key research questions in this study is to increase the contributions of BDAC toward improving innovation performance in the presence of the abovementioned variables and relationships that exist between them. The chosen research approach can be improved by carrying out interviews with the top management to obtain more relevant and detailed information for developing a better understanding of the abovementioned relationships. Practical implications: This study outlines how organizations that are developing BDAC approaches can focus on relevant factors and variables to help their initiatives and its role in organizational innovative performance. This will also help them develop sustainable competitive advantage in manufacturing concerns, specifically in the health industry, namely, the pharmaceutical industry. Originality/value: This study investigated the effects and implications of big data on organizations in the AI era that aim to achieve innovation performance. At the same time, it provides an original understanding of the contextual importance of investing in BDAC development. It also considers the role of management accountants as a bridge between data scientists and business managers in a big data environment, especially in the pharmaceutical industry.

The last decade has seen a growth in AI-based applications proliferating the HRM function, triggering an exciting new stream of research on topics such as the social presence of AI and robotics, effects of AI adoption on individual and business level outcomes, and evaluating AI-enabled HRM practices. Adopting these technologies has resulted in how work is organised in local and international firms, noting opportunities for employees and firms’ resource utilisation, decision-making, and problem-solving. However, despite a growing interest in scholarship, research on AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Further research is needed that analyses the role of AI-assisted applications in HRM functions and human-AI interactions in large multinational enterprises diffusing such innovations. In response to these combined issues—the fragmented nature of research and limited extant literature, we present a systematic review on the theme of this special issue and offer a nuanced understating of what is known, yet to be known, and future research directions to frame a future research agenda for international HRM. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates research on AI applications in HRM and offers a cohesive base for future research endeavours.

Due to this improvement, chatbots with artificial intelligence appeared. A chatbot is a robot (bot), built through rules defined by a conversational flow and/or Artificial Intelligence, which meets a certain demand of the person who is chatting with it and delivers pre-defined responses. Chatting with a chatbot allows you to solve most customer requests without the intervention of a human, and applications can rely on a powerful ally, artificial intelligence. There are chatbots with and without artificial intelligence; the adoption of one or the other depends on the business of each company. The greater the degree of difficulty in identifying its presence, the greater its efficiency. With artificial intelligence, chatbots can develop in a surprising way, going far beyond a customer service solution, and even becoming indispensable in business strategy.

However, each system element is characterized by certain functionality, which depends on the place and the role within this system, as well as on resource potential, territorial organization, existing traditions in lifestyle and professional spheres (Akupiyan and Kapinos in Innova AIC: Probl Prospects 3:50–60, 2018 [2]). In this connection, rural areas have some specific features, since they represent a complicated multi-functional socioeconomic subsystem of a country’s economy, with agriculture being the key element, including a natural component in conjunction with economic and social, which determines the specific natural and economic organization on rural areas. In contemporary theory and practice, particularly topical is the detection of institutional and organizational-and-economic factors, which determine the innovative development of rural territorial entities based on the improvement of life quality of rural population and integration processes in agriculture that facilitate the use of digital technologies. These issues were addressed by (Kusakina et al. in Adv Intell Syst Comput 726:695–700, 2019 [6]; Kusakina O. & Dovgotko N. in Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems, pp 435–448, 2020 [7]; Markin and Markina in Nikonovsky Readings 13:340–341, 2008 [8]; Nikolaev in AIC: Econo Manage 8:3–7, 2010 [9]; Vorontsova et al. in Meta-Scientific Study of Artificial Intelligence.

The goal of the article is to investigate the quality of rural populations’ life, to substantiate the prospects of housebuilding in rural areas, to identify integration possibilities for agricultural business development using a polyparadigmatic approach to the study of factors and conditions of innovative development of rural areas. To achieve the set goal, the authors of the research perform a survey for the residents of rural areas in southern Russia. The survey is carried out via Internet information-and-communication network according to a standardized questionnaire, created in Google Forms service, which allowed researching the prospects of housebuilding in rural areas, as well as the emerging organizational and economic factors. The main group of questions refers to satisfaction with living conditions in rural areas, factors of rural life attraction, improvement of living conditions in rural areas, as well as the use of financial instruments to stimulate housebuilding. According to the authors of the article, the key factor to determine the vector of innovative development in rural areas is the integrative interaction of AIC subjects, which increases their sensitivity to innovative transformations under the conditions of higher competition in the agricultural market and high-cost agricultural production due to the use of traditional production factors (Kislitskiy et al. in Agri-food Policy of Russia 6:56–65, 2013 [5]). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Digital economy; Ecosystem of innovative development; Factors of innovative development of rural areas; Innovative development of rural areas","Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Economics; Surveys; Condition; Digital economy; Economic factors; Ecosystem of innovative development; Factor of innovative development of rural area; Housebuilding; Innovative development of rural area; Living conditions; Rural population; Social development; Rural areas",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126186756

The purpose of this paper is to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML could be included in research and education in the future for the management accountant. Design/methodology/approach: This paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting bodies and by large consulting companies. Findings: First, only very few academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance and logistics. Second, the literature review also indicates that if the management accountants want to keep up with the demand of their qualifications, they must take action now and begin to discuss how big data and other concepts from artificial intelligence and ML can benefit MA and the management accountant in specific ways. Originality/value: Even though the paper may be classified as inspirational in nature, the paper documents and discusses the revised environment that surrounds the accountant today. The paper concludes by highlighting specifically the necessity of including exploratory data analysis and unsupervised ML in the field of MA to close the existing gaps in both education and research and thus making the MA profession future-proof. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accountant; Analytics; Business translator; Exploratory data analysis; Machine learning; Management accounting; Statistics; Unsupervised machine learning",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126023567

Market manipulation can cost investors significant sums and reduce investor confidence, negatively impacting the efficiency of the markets that businesses rely on to raise capital and that pension funds, superannuation funds and sovereign wealth funds rely on to generate returns. With over AUD1 trillion of Australian taxpayer money currently invested in securities markets through superannuation funds, the stakes are high. As criminals have become more sophisticated in their efforts to manipulate financial markets, enforcement efforts have also become more innovative, utilising new technologies to detect and respond to criminal behaviour and protect investors, the public and the global financial system. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the state of the field in application of AI to policing of financial markets and take an interdisciplinary look at opportunities to enhance the use of AI in policing more broadly. The chapter begins with an explanation of the laws designed to combat crime on financial markets—in particular the offences of insider trading and market manipulation. This is followed by an analysis of the current state of the field and discussion of the application of AI to detect and deter financial crime, as well as the use of AI in other areas of policing. The chapter concludes with lessons and opportunities from the application of AI to policing financial crime, noting the risks and limitations of an AI approach and the challenges and opportunities for expanding the application of AI to policing more generally. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Financial crime; Law enforcement; Machine learning; Policing",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125930551

This paper uses data collected over a 12 month period from a bus operator in Sydney where we fitted sensors on all tyres of 35 buses monitored on a monthly data capture plan, which together with data obtained from a telematics system installed in each bus and other data describing the operating environment, enabled us to develop a system of equations to identify endogenous and exogenous influences on tread depth loss of each tyre and fuel consumption, and to map this into implications on maintenance costs. The estimated model system is built into a decision support system to investigate ways in which a bus business can improve its cost efficiency through a changed tyre-related maintenance and operating regime. The findings suggest significant opportunities to improve cost efficiency by a careful review of the decisions related to the practices associated with tyres. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bus operation; cost efficiency; fuel consumption; maintenance costs; tyre maintenance","Artificial intelligence; Buses; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Fuels; Tires; Australia; Bus operation; Bus services; Case-studies; Cost-efficiency; Maintenance cost; Telematics; Tire performance; Tyre maintenance; Urban bus; Maintenance",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125926090

These technologies enable companies to leverage big quantities of data to improve system performance and accelerate business development. However, despite the appeal of ML/DL, there is a lack of systematic and structured methods and processes to help data scientists and other company roles and functions to develop, deploy and evolve models. In this paper, based on multi-case study research in six companies, we explore practices and challenges practitioners experience in developing ML/DL models as part of large software-intensive embedded systems. Based on our empirical findings, we derive a conceptual framework in which we identify three high-level activities that companies perform in parallel with the development, deployment and evolution of models. Within this framework, we outline activities, iterations and triggers that optimize model design as well as roles and company functions. In this way, we provide practitioners with a blueprint for effectively integrating ML/DL model development into the business to achieve better results than other (algorithmic) approaches. In addition, we show how this framework helps companies solve the challenges we have identified and discuss checkpoints for terminating the business case. © 2022 The Authors.

AI can foster intelligent decisions for retrieving and sharing information for learning and research. However, extant literature confirms a low adoption rate by the university libraries in using AI to provide innovative alternative services, as this is missing in their strategic plan. The research develops (AI-LSICF) an artificial intelligence library services innovative conceptual framework to provide new insight into how AI technology can be used to deliver value-added innovative library services to achieve digital transformation. It will also encourage library and information professionals to adopt AI to complement effective service delivery. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a qualitative content analysis to investigate extant literature on how AI adoption fosters innovative services in various organisations. The study also used content analysis to generate possible solutions to aid AI service innovation and delivery in university libraries. Findings: This study uses its findings to develop an Artificial Intelligence Library Services Innovative Conceptual Framework (AI-LSICF) by integrating AI applications and functions into the digital transformation framework elements and discussed using a service innovation framework. Research limitations/implications: In research, AI-LSICF helps increase an understanding of AI by presenting new insights into how the university library can leverage technology to actualise innovation in service provision to foster DT. This trail will be valuable to scholars and academics interested in addressing the application pathways of AI library service innovation, which is still under-explored in digital transformation. Practical implications: In practice, AI-LSICF could reform the information industry from its traditional brands into a more applied and resolutely customer-driven organisation. This reformation will awaken awareness of how librarians and information professionals can leverage technology to catch up with digital transformation in this age of the fourth industrial revolution. Social implications: The enlightenment of AI-LSICF will motivate library professionals to take advantage of AI's potential to enhance their current business model and achieve a unique competitive advantage within their community. Originality/value: AI-LSICF development serves as a revelation, motivating university libraries and information professionals to consider AI in their strategic plan to enable technology to support university education. This act will enable alternative service delivery in the face of unforeseen circumstances like technological disruption and the present global COVID-19 pandemic that requires non-physical interaction. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19 pandemic; Digital transformation; Digital transformation framework; Digital transformation technology; Fourth industrial revolution (4IR); Service innovation framework; University library services transformation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125897567

Accessibility is a crucial element that can make a difference and determine the success or failure of a digital business. The study was applied to 50 e-commerce sites in the top rankings according to the classification proposed by ecommerceDB. In evaluating the web accessibility of e-commerce sites, we applied an automatic review method based on a modification of Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0. To evaluate accessibility, we used Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) with the extension for Google Chrome, which helps verify password-protected, locally stored, or highly dynamic pages. The study found that the correlation between the ranking of e-commerce websites and accessibility barriers is 0.329, indicating that the correlation is low positive according to Spearman’s Rho. According to the WAVE analysis, the research results reveal that the top 10 most accessible websites are Sainsbury’s Supermarkets, Walmart, Target Corporation, Macy’s, IKEA, H&M Hennes, Chewy, Kroger, QVC, and Nike. The most significant number of accessibility barriers relate to contrast errors that must be corrected for e-commerce websites to reach an acceptable level of accessibility. The most neglected accessibility principle is perceivable, representing 83.1%, followed by operable with 13.7%, in third place is robust with 1.7% and finally understandable with 1.5%.

PSM research can address these problems through design science research. Design science is also regarded as the science of the artificial. Design science research is a methodology that aims to systematically generate knowledge for the design, synthesis, testing, and evaluation of human-made artefacts (e.g., tools, interventions, policies) that solve practical problems. PSM artefacts such as the purchasing portfolio matrix invented by Kraljic (1983) represent a valuable opportunity to solve problems in the PSM discipline. However, our artificial-intelligence (AI)-based analysis of the discipline's flagship journal, the Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management (JPSM), indicates that design-oriented publications in PSM are underrepresented, accounting for less than 4% of the total publications. We argue that existing PSM research should be complemented with more design-oriented research, and address the following research question: How can PSM scholars publish more design-oriented research? Our objectives are to (1) provide arguments for advancing PSM as a design science, (2) nurture a better understanding of design science research as a methodology, and (3) propose publication guidelines that enable researchers to present design-oriented research in a management journal. © 2022 The Authors","Design science; Procurement; Publication guidelines; Purchasing",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125724659

Aiming at the problems of lacking of a unified data model, incomplete sensor data and cross-system data fusion in the entire mine intelligent giant system, a unified multi-source heterogeneous data fusion processing method is proposed. A complete digital perception system of cross-system full-time and space information in underground coal mines has been developed based on the data logic model of ""hierarchical extraction-association analysis-virtual-real mapping"", which forms a multi-parameter, multi-scale, and full-time-space characteristic data perception scheme that integrates underground production status, mining space information, coal machine equipment status, risk information, etc. Based on the information ""entity"" and virtual-real mapping mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous relational data in coal mines, the initiative matching, push strategy and automatic update mechanism of information entities based on the knowledge demand model is proposed to solve the problem of real-time data connection and iterative update. The coupling technology of intelligent coal mine system based on ABCD (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing and Big Data) is proposed, and the data interaction and fusion process of complex giant system is illustrated taking the coupling of coal mine safety assurance system as an example.

Linguistically, a portmanteau combines deep learning aspects of AI with the doctored or falsified enhancements that deem the content fake and now deepfake or misinformation results. A variety of sophisticated software programs’ exacting algorithms create high-quality videos and manipulated audio of people who may not exist, twisting others who do exist, creating the potential for leading to the spread of serious misinformation often with serious consequences. The rate of detection of this digital emergence is proliferating exponentially and the sourcing is challenging to verify, causing alarms. Examples of this pervasive information warfare are is associated with deepfakes that range from identity theft, discrediting public figures and celebrities, cyberbullying, blackmail, threats to national security, personal privacy, intensifying pornography and sexual exploitation, cybersecurity, baiting hate crimes, abusing social media platforms and manipulating metadata. Deepfakes that are difficult to cite, acquire, or track have some parallel attributes to grey literature by that definition. Often detectable, yet problematic, activities such as phishing and robocalling may be common attempts of deepfake activities that threaten and interrupt rhythms of daily life. The increasing online personas that many people create or assume contribute to this fake content and potential for escalated exploitation due to technical abilities to copy and reimagine details that are not true. AI image generators create completely false images of people that simply don’t exist within seconds and are nearly impossible to track. While AI is perceived as a positive benefit for science and policy, it can have negative roles in this new AI threatened environment. Deepfakes have crossover targets in common business applications and society at large. Examples of this blur are targeted advertising, undetected security cameras in public spaces, blockchain, tabloid press/paparazzi, entertainment, computer games, online publishing, data and privacy, courtroom testimony, public opinion, scientific evidence, political campaigns, and rhetoric. This paper explores the impact and intersections of these behaviors and activities, products of AI, and emerging technologies with how digital grey and the optics of grey expose the dangers of deepfakes on everyday life. Applying a security and privacy lens, we offer insights of extending libel and slander into more serious criminal behavior as deepfakes become more pervasive, construing reality, endangering personal, social, and global safety nets adding to the new normal we assume today. How we became more sensitized to misinformation and fake news tells the story about deepfakes. © 2022 TextRelease.

Digital innovations, such as the Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and various digital technology-based platforms, are influencing business venturing and changing the ways that extend beyond entrepreneurship and innovation practices to influence culture, politics and society. Social media platforms and digital communications have even restructured social relations. Yet little research has fully addressed the profound relationship between technology, entrepreneurship/innovation and social change. To correct this oversight, this Special Issue in Technovation is devoted to publishing original research that enriches our knowledge about the nature of digital technology and its influence on entrepreneurship and innovation in digital economies. We elaborate the emerging new business models, their antecedents, and their economic and social consequences. The issue also highlights key emerging research areas of digital technology-based entrepreneurship/innovation and articulates an agenda for future scholarship. © 2022","Digital economics; Digital technology; Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Social changes",,Editorial,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125473505

Given the current global context, businesses are fundamentally reshaping. We have identified that digital transformation of businesses is accelerating. Every aspect of the business is changing starting from how employees work, monitoring supply chains, and continuing to how businesses are changing various processes by using automation on a widespread scale. It is important to mention that while some businesses, mostly those with a business model based on online activities, are thriving in this global crisis because of the increasing number of consumers, several other companies are seeing a decline in customer numbers and business turnover. The decline due to COVID-19 lockdown is not seen only in businesses that offer tangible products but also in the digital business of the sharing economy due to decrease of both demand and offer. Consuming patterns of customers are changing, and now more than ever businesses must harvest the data for getting better insight.

Many insights from psychology, sociology, and even biology show that we are susceptible to perceptual, judgmental, and behavioral biases and to psychological and social “soft” influencing of decision making. The latter gains more traction, both in society and in business, than any neutral problem-solving goal. In general, persons are more receptive and biased towards attitude and moral stances than towards rational argumentation: At any given moment in time, some problems are intractable by given technical means but they still need to be overcome in some way. Behavioral economics shows us that human behavior is not rational and consistent, as textbook theory suggests. Entrepreneurs act opportunistically but market pressure is driving firms also towards “bad” opportunism; however, ethics can limit this propensity. Psychological and social influencing, described in behavioral economics, can guide the behavior towards being more aligned with the public good. Our research question is whether and how such influencing can be compatible with capitalist entrepreneurship, for example, by generating green investment funds. Our derived research goal is then to explore the mechanisms behind influencing, their relation to moral behavior and ethics – especially in today’s atmosphere of multiple crisis. The research method used is to first qualitatively review mechanisms of influencing. However, the complex, intertemporal context calls for procedures of inclusive action, which we outline in a conceptual approach in the spirit of business informatics. We conclude that under specific conditions entrepreneurship may indeed prove instrumental for overcoming crises. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral economics; Entrepreneurship; Ethics; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125334047

It is anticipated that the future business environment will be characterized by a variety of intelligent systems and autonomous robots. In 2017, the International Federation of Robotics reported that momentum gained by robotic technologies is strong and that the sales volumes of both service and industrial robots is expected to grow. Building on this projection, the present study proposes a set of prerequisites or key determinants for the adoption of autonomous robots in the supply chain and logistics industry: technological context (i.e., relative advantage, complexity, and cost), organizational context (i.e., management support, financial support and employee competence) and environmental context (i.e., competitive pressure, customer pressure and vendor support). The study adapts a quantitative research design and uses an online survey to collect the needed data to test the conceptual framework and hypotheses proposed. Part of the study results confirms the association between the cost of digital technologies and the adoption of autonomous robots. However, the study found no evidence that the perceived relative advantage positively impacts supply chain and logistics firms’ adoption of autonomous robots. The study offers some managerial advices to supply chain mangers and marketers of the digital technologies and tools that can be applied in the supply chain setting. © 2022 Growing Science Ltd.

The software architecture used in building those kinds of products represents a major factor in their lifecycle, costs, and roadmap, as it affects their maintainability and extensibility. In this study, our novel approach designed for detecting MVC architectural layers from mobile codebases (that use SDK for building their UI interrfaces) is validated and analysed from various perspectives (Artificial Intelligence, architectural rules, empiric evaluation). Our proposal is validated on eight different-sized iOS codebases corresponding to different mobile applications that have different scopes (both open and closed source). The performance of the detection quality is measured by the accuracy of the system, as we compared to a manually constructed ground truth, achieving an average accuracy of 85% on all the analyzed codebases. Our hybrid approach for detecting architectural layers achieves good results by combining the accuracy of the deterministic methods with the flexibility for being used on other architectural patterns and platforms via the non-deterministic step. We also validate the workflow of the proposal from an empirical point of view through an interview with two mobile application developers. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automatic analysis of software architectures; Hybrid approach; Mobile applications software architecture analyser; Software clustering; Structural and lexical information","Application programs; Life cycle; Mobile computing; Architectural layers; Automatic analyse of software architecture; Automatic analysis; Hybrid approach; Lexical information; Mobile application software; Mobile application software architecture analyser; Mobile applications; Software clustering; Structural information; Software architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125228106

Due to the increasing demand for multilanguage translation, it is an urgent problem to effectively improve the quality of text translation. Driven by the upsurge of artificial intelligence, neural network technology is increasingly integrated into the field of machine translation, which gradually expands the traditional machine translation method into neural machine translation method. With the continuous improvement of deep learning technology, machine translation has gradually integrated these methods and strategies and achieved good results in multiple tasks, but there are still some shortcomings. The most prominent problem is that, since word vector is the basis for the model to obtain semantic and grammatical information, the existing methods cannot obtain semantic and grammatical feature information, which greatly reduces the accuracy of English translation. Based on this, this paper proposed a method of splicing word vector with character- level and word-level encoding vector. The characterization of fusion of more word vector can effectively solve the word does not appear in the table, the word with some low frequency, can express meaning more complete information, performance directly affects the whole translation model, the results can be seen through the experiment, we put forward the characteristics of the fusion method and strategy, can effectively enhance the overall translation performance of the model.

Furthermore, the authors discuss the tactics in which information technology is used to implement business strategies to transform businesses and to incentivise the implementation of these technologies in current or future emergency situations. Design/methodology/approach: The review provides the rapidly growing literature on the use of smart technology during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The 127 empirical articles the authors have identified suggest that 39 forms of smart technologies have been used, ranging from artificial intelligence to computer vision technology. Eight different industries have been identified that are using these technologies, primarily food services and manufacturing. Further, the authors list 40 generalised types of activities that are involved including providing health services, data analysis and communication. To prevent the spread of illness, robots with artificial intelligence are being used to examine patients and give drugs to them. The online execution of teaching practices and simulators have replaced the classroom mode of teaching due to the epidemic. The AI-based Blue-dot algorithm aids in the detection of early warning indications. The AI model detects a patient in respiratory distress based on face detection, face recognition, facial action unit detection, expression recognition, posture, extremity movement analysis, visitation frequency detection, sound pressure detection and light level detection. The above and various other applications are listed throughout the paper. Research limitations/implications: Research is largely delimited to the area of COVID-19-related studies. Also, bias of selective assessment may be present. In Indian context, advanced technology is yet to be harnessed to its full extent. Also, educational system is yet to be upgraded to add these technologies potential benefits on wider basis. Practical implications: First, leveraging of insights across various industry sectors to battle the global threat, and smart technology is one of the key takeaways in this field. Second, an integrated framework is recommended for policy making in this area. Lastly, the authors recommend that an internet-based repository should be developed, keeping all the ideas, databases, best practices, dashboard and real-time statistical data. Originality/value: As the COVID-19 is a relatively recent phenomenon, such a comprehensive review does not exist in the extant literature to the best of the authors’ knowledge.

While we know from extant research that a firm's R&D investment, intangible assets, and productivity are factors that influence technology use more generally, to date there is little known about the factors that determine how these emerging tools are used, and by who. Using Probit and OLS modeling on a survey of 12,579 South Korean firms in 2017, we conduct one of the first comprehensive examinations highlighting various firm characteristics that drive NGDT implementation. While much of the literature assesses the use of individual technologies, our research attempts to unveil the extent to which firms implement NGDTs in bundles. Our investigation shows that more than half of the firms that use NGDTs deployed multiple technologies simultaneously. One of the insightful complementarities identified in this research exists amongst technologies that generate, facilitate and demand large sums of data, including big data, IoT, cloud computing and AI. Such technologies also appear important for innovative tools such as 3D printing and robotics. © 2022",,"Big data; Digital storage; Internet of things; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Business innovation; Comprehensive examination; Digital technologies; Emerging tools; Individual technology; Intangible assets; Technology implementation; Technology use; 3D printers",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124912033

Industry 4.0 is upon us and promising a smarter production that is digitally networked and built on data-intense models. However, fostering innovation inside the newsroom takes place with as many hindrances and bureaucratic obstacles as possible. To address how news outlets are adopting new approaches to sustain their business, we conducted fourteen (n = 14) in-depth interviews with leading actors of news organizations in Brazil, a leading country within the Global South with a complex national reality. Our study systematically analyzes qualitative data to present technology-driven, innovative business models and technologies that will be major players in the news industry’s future. Results indicated that organizations do not rely on a unique income source but combine different sustainable models of funding. By deploying technological assets in the news business, these outlets are capable of meeting the needs of audiences and better identifying customer segments, which brings a competitive advantage to these organizations. In summary, this research resulted in responsive knowledge sharing about digital journalism’s business model that is being implemented for the next revolution. © 2022 The Author(s).

Artificial intelligence and robotics have become prevalent in modern economic, professional, social, and daily lives. As a function of its ability to update and develop business processes and innovative ideas, services, and products and resolve difficult tasks to achieve new, entrepreneurship has experienced massive development. Significant changes are occurring in entrepreneurship and economic growth due to artificial intelligence. Therefore, this paper aims to understand the effect and components of data entrepreneurship overall with the help of an artificial intelligence-based feasibility evaluation model (AI-FEM). Robot, edge and physical resource layers are described in depth in this document. We first deploy an edge node near the data sources to combine multiple devices' interfaces and function as a raw data filter. Then it provides opportunity recognition, opportunity development, and opportunity implementation processes are part of the framework's processes described in this paper. This paper aims to develop a basic framework for evaluating AI's potential implications for the interaction between entrepreneurship and economic growth. The economic growth of industrial robots reduces basic labor costs. However, it increases hourly compensation, suggesting that the productivity-enhancing advantage of industrial robots equals the wage-increasing influence. The results show that the system is feasible and performs better in real-time and network transmission than in an AI-based industry scenario. The experimental results of AI-FEM show the high-performance ratio of 95.5%, productivity ratio of 96.3%, reliability ratio of 93.4%, the employment rate of 92.6%, an efficiency ratio of 93.6%, industrial management ratio of 90.3%, and cost-effectiveness ratio of 20.3% compared to other methods. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Artificial intelligence; data; economic; entrepreneurship; industrial revolution; robots","Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Function evaluation; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Productivity; Business Process; Daily lives; Data collection; Economic growths; Economic life; Entrepreneurship; Evaluation models; Industrial revolutions; Professional life; Social life; Wages",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124749382

The success of emerging technologies to innovate business processes, however, largely depends on the acceptance by employees, e.g., as being the end users for human-robot collaboration. The current paper addresses a yet under investigated technology, namely robotics with more advanced levels of intelligence. The existing literature about intelligent robots is still scarce and mainly limited to applications in particular sectors. Since intelligent robot applications will increase in the medium term, our purpose is to add an interdisciplinary perspective by examining the degree to which acceptance differs among master students as highly-skilled future employees. Our survey shows that gender and academic discipline only have a limited impact to predict the acceptance of intelligent robots at work, but different adoption profiles seem to matter most for robotic process changes. Finally, we discuss the role of students, universities and employees to better prepare for the future digitalization of the workplace. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acceptance; Future employees; Intelligent robots; Students","Human robot interaction; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Robot applications; Robotics; 'current; Acceptance; Business Process; Emerging technologies; End-users; Future employee; Human-robot collaboration; Master students; Process change; Student perspectives; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124659331

Not long ago, cloud computing was confined to the wall of high-revenue companies, but in recent times a growing number of businesses, public and private institutions are turning to the cloud computing platform to reap the benefits of a self-service, scalable, and flexible infrastructure. Moreover, with the increased implementation, advantages, and popularity of artificial intelligence, the demand for computing environments to solve age-old problems such as malaria and cancer is on the rise. This paper presents the implementation of a cloud computing infrastructure, the FEDerated GENomics (FEDGEN) Testbed, to provide an adequate IT environment for cancer and malaria researchers. The cloud computing environment is built using Openstack middleware. OpenStack is deployed using Metal-As-A-Service (MAAS) and Juju. Virtual Machines (Instances) were deployed, and services (JupiterHub) were installed on the FEDGEN testbed. The built infrastructure would allow the running of models requiring high computing power and would allow for collaboration among teams. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud computing; Federated cloud; Juju; MAAS; Openstack","Artificial intelligence; Diseases; Middleware; Testbeds; Artificial intelligence research; Cloud infrastructures; Cloud-computing; Federated clouds; Genomics; Juju; Metal-as-A-service; Private clouds; Private institutions; Public institution; Platform as a Service (PaaS)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124645375

A new framework for determination and identification of PD is the world's most severe neurological disorder, was proposed in this article. It is the most dangerous infection which disables individuals' discourse, and different attributes, for example feelings and sensation. In this work, we initially examined about a new approach for determining the PD. Second, we proposed cloud based storage architecture for securing data in cloud computing environment. Cloud based system for distinguishing and checking Parkinson infection will expand its significance in social insurance benefit in low asset setting and security examination. This structure guarantees effective handling of huge information in distributed computing condition and acquires business experiences. In the creating nations, where the greater part of the general population does not get appropriate social insurance benefits and are not concerned of Parkinson's sickness, not to mention recognizing and getting human services for PD, this framework can be extremely commonsense and helpful. The framework, PD affected patient can be effortlessly identified as well as analyzed by giving their voice tests over their telephones. The proposed frameworks are profited to accomplish 95.8% precision in the cloud condition for recognizing PD.

The Internet of Things and cloud computing are nowadays the integral part of most software applications that assist in acquiring and storing data seamlessly. It provides the convenience of accessibility for the end-user like home automation, storage of huge streams of data, giving elasticity for increasing or decreasing the volume of data. When it comes to decentralized behavior, applications need to be transformed into blockchain technology. Blockchain technology offers value-added features to applications in terms of enhanced security and easier traceability. The blockchain’s unchangeable and incorruptible nature protects it from tampering and hacking. Forensics requires the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence. Artificial Intelligence is predominant in many areas and momentum is gaining to utilize it in the field of forensics. This chapter reviews the application of forensics using Artificial Intelligence in the field of Cloud computing, IoT, and Blockchain Technology. To fulfill the study’s goal, a systematic literature review (SLR) was done. By manually searching six (6) well-known databases, documents were extracted. Based on the study topic, thirty three (33) primary studies were eventually considered. The study also discovered that (1) highlights several well-known challenges and open-Issues in IoT forensics research, as it is dependent on other technologies and is crucial when considering an end-to-end IoT application as an integrated environment with cloud and other technologies.

At present, traditional patterns are designed mainly by professional designers. Due to the high dependence of the entire design process on labor, the design efficiency is untoward to improve to rapidly meet the explosive growth of business needs. However, a large amount of material data on the Internet and the development of artificial intelligence technology provides an opportunity to work out this development bottleneck. This paper mainly studies the design and implementation of the automatic generation of traditional pattern image layout based on the generation of confrontation network and aesthetic evaluation to score the quality of the generated traditional pattern image. And the scoring results are fed back to the traditional pattern layout generation network to improve the quality of the generated traditional pattern layout pictures so that the entire network structure can adapt to disparate scene requirements. The results show that the SSIM value of the structural similarity obtained by the image of the traditional pattern automatically generated by the model in this paper is larger and closer to 1 than the value of the SSIM obtained by other methods, indicating that the image of the traditional pattern automatically generated by the model has the highest aesthetic quality. Furthermore, the research provides assistance for intelligent technology to solve the development bottleneck of conventional pattern design. Finally, the future research of digital image quality evaluation approach is prospected. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aesthetic evaluation; Automatic generation; Quality evaluation; Traditional patterns",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124412304

Using digital technologies generates a huge amount of data that are exploited by Business Intelligence (BI) to make decisions and improve the management of firms. This becomes particularly relevant in the healthcare sector where decisions are traditionally made on the physicians’ experience. Much work has been done on applying BI in the healthcare industry. Most of these studies were focused only on IT or medical aspects, while the usage of BI for improving the management of healthcare processes is an under-investigated field. This research aims at filling this gap by investigating whether a decision support system (DSS) model based on the exploitation of data through BI can outperform traditional experience-driven practices for managing processes in the healthcare domain. Focusing on the managing process of the therapeutic path of oncological patients, specifically BRCA-mutated women with breast cancer, a DSS model for benchmarking the costs of various treatment paths was developed in two versions: the first is experience-driven while the second is data-driven. We found that the data-driven version of the DSS model leads to a more accurate estimation of the costs that could potentially be prevented in the treatment of oncological patients, thus enabling significant cost savings. A more informed decision due to a more accurate cost estimation becomes crucial in a context where optimal treatment and unique clinical recommendations for patients are absent, thus permitting a substantial improvement of the decision making in the healthcare industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Business intelligence; Data-driven; Decision making; Decision support system model; Healthcare; Oncology","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Big data; Cost estimating; Decision making; Information analysis; Patient treatment; Business-intelligence; Clinical decision making; Data driven; Data-driven approach; Decision support system model; Decisions makings; Digital technologies; Healthcare industry; Healthcare sectors; System models; Decision support systems",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124263471

In the era of Big Data, the cache is regarded as one of the most effective techniques to improve the performance of accessing data. DW has been widely used by several organizations to manage data and use it for Decision Support System (DSS). Many methods have been used to optimize the performance of fetching data from DW. Query cache method is one of those methods that play an effective role in optimization. The proposed work is based on a cache-based mechanism that helps DW in two aspects: the first one is to reduce the execution time by directly accessing records from cache memory, and the second is to save cache memory space by eliminating non-frequent data. Our target is to fill the cache memory with the most used data. To achieve this goal aging-based Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm is used by considering the size and frequency of data simultaneously. The priority and expiry age of the data in the cache memory is managed by dealing with both the size and frequency of data. LFU sets priorities and counts the age of data placed in cache memory. The entry with the lowest age count and priority is eliminated first from the cache block. Ultimately, the proposed cache mechanism efficiently utilized cache memory and fills a large performance gap between the main DW and the business user query. © 2013 IEEE.","big data; Data warehouse; optimization; query optimization","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Information management; Accessing data; Business-intelligence; Cache mechanism; Data caches; Least frequently used; Optimisations; Performance; Queries optimization; Time factors; Cache memory",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124221217

Nowadays, every company owns and operates an ITS, but detailed information about the system is rarely publicly available. However, there are many situations where the availability of such data would be beneficial. For example, cyber ranges need descriptions of complex realistic IT systems in order to provide an effective training and education platform. Furthermore, various algorithms in cybersecurity, in particular attack tree generation, need to be validated on realistic models of IT systems. In this paper, we describe a system we call the Generator that, based on the high-level requirements such as the number of employees and the business area the target company belongs to, generates a model of an ITS that satisfies the given requirements. We put special emphasis on the following two criteria: the generated ITS models a large amount of details, and ideally resembles a real system. Our survey of related literature found no sufficiently similar prior works, so we believe that this is the first attempt of building something like this. We created a proof-of-concept implementation of the Generator, validated it by generating ITS models for a simplified fictional financial institution, and analyzed the Generators performance with respect to the problem size. The research was done in an iterative manner, with coauthors continuously providing feedback on intermediate results. The conducted experiments show that our approach is feasible. In the future, we intend to extend this prototype to allow probabilistic generation of IT systems when only a subset of parameters is explicitly defined, and further develop and validate our approach with the help of domain experts. © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber range; expert systems; information technology system","Artificial intelligence; Computer system firewalls; Computational modelling; Cybe range; Cyber security; Generator; Information technology systems; IT system; License; Prototype; System models; Workstation; Cybersecurity",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124066422

This study's purpose is to offer insights into how AI can transform organizations' work practices through diving deeply into its innovative use in the context of a primary AI tool, a chatbot, and examining the antecedents of innovative use by conceptualizing employee trust as a multidimensional construct and exploring employees' perceived benefits. In particular, we have conceptualized employee trust in chatbots as a second-order construct, including three first-order variables: trust in functionality, trust in reliability, and trust in data protection. We collected data from 202 employees. The results supported our conceptualization of trust in chatbots and showed that three dimensions of first-order trust beliefs have relatively the same level of importance. Further, both knowledge support and work–life balance enhance trust in chatbots, which in turn leads to innovative use of chatbots.

There is a growing impact of machine learning in business applications, with many solutions already established and many more being explored. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being promptly adopted for various applications in the financial services industry. In essence, risk assessment happens if an investor and financial consultant analyses try to measure possible risks in investments such as morally sterilizing, following the fund's investment goals, and taking suitable action. Hence this paper's Machine learning-based risk awareness model (ML-RAM) has been proposed to reduce the financial crisis. This paper utilizes the RAM to focus on organized financial networks through potential financial threats. Early warning metrics boost the accuracy of the traditional crisis forecast model. The empirical analysis of small and medium companies asking for credit exposes that risky and not risky borrowers can be clustered consistent with a set of similar financial features, explaining their credit scores and predicting their future behavior. The data on which a considerable rise in correlations and centrality occur show a financial risk using network analyses and machine learning algorithms. Thus, the experimental results show that the ML-RAM offers more effective analysis for the finance industry than other methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Early warning system; Finance industry; Financial crisis; Machine learning; Risk awareness model",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123773884

As for the medical industry, huge unstructured data has been accumulated, so exploring how to use medical image data more effectively to efficiently complete diagnosis has an important practical impact. For a long time, China has been striving to promote the process of medical informatization, and the combination of big data and artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies in the medical field has become a hot industry and a new development trend. This paper focuses on cardiovascular diseases and uses relevant deep learning methods to realize automatic analysis and diagnosis of medical images and verify the feasibility of AI-assisted medical treatment. We have tried to achieve a complete diagnosis of cardiovascular medical imaging and localize the vulnerable lesion area. (1) We tested the classical object based on a convolutional neural network and experiment, explored the region segmentation algorithm, and showed its application scenarios in the field of medical imaging. (2) According to the data and task characteristics, we built a network model containing classification nodes and regression nodes. After the multitask joint drill, the effect of diagnosis and detection was also enhanced. In this paper, a weighted loss function mechanism is used to improve the imbalance of data between classes in medical image analysis, and the effect of the model is enhanced.

This research mainly discusses the intelligent manufacturing management system based on data mining in artificial intelligence energy-saving resources. The enterprise business management system cannot accurately and timely grasp the actual situation of the production site, and the accuracy and feasibility of the upper-level planning cannot be guaranteed. At the same time, on-site personnel and equipment cannot get practical production plans and production instructions in time, resulting in product backlogs and excessive inventory. On the other hand, equipment is idle and resources are wasted, and the workshop scheduling system loses the corresponding scheduling role. The development of this system is mainly composed of front-end technology, back-end technology and front-end and back-end interaction technology. The interface design of the front end is mainly completed by the windows form application in c#. The interaction between the front and back ends is mainly realized by programming in each control of the form application. Back-end technology is the core content of the system, mainly including two key technologies: mixed programming of C #. Net and MATLAB and C # connecting SQL Server database. The system mainly includes five sub-functional modules: order management, material management, mixed model assembly line balance, assembly line logistics scheduling and system management. Order management and material management are the basis of the system, which provides parameter input for the balance of assembly line and logistics scheduling. The balance of mixed model assembly line is the core function of the system. The balance of mixed model assembly line is carried out by calling the intelligent algorithm written in MATLAB, and the optimal assembly scheme of workstation is displayed to the front end of the system, which reflects the intelligent characteristics of production control system for intelligent manufacturing. The logistics scheduling of assembly line takes the balance result of mixed model assembly line as the premise, takes the balance result as the task sequence input of logistics scheduling, and optimizes the operation efficiency of logistics system (driving path and running time of AGV). The operation results show that the comprehensive energy consumption of 10,000 yuan industrial output value is 401.19 kg standard coal/10,000 yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 6.96%.

This profoundly interconnected worldwide network model offers new sorts of difficulties from a safety, belief and protection viewpoint. Subsequently, security for IoT will be a basic worry that must be tended to so as to empower a few present and upcoming applications. The resource constrained gadgets, for example, mobile phones, RFIDs, PDAs, sensor hubs and so on are the piece of IoT. Configuration measure for making sure about these gadgets is guided by factors like low energy consumption, great execution and vigor to intrusions. Giving security in IoT is trying as the gadgets has resource constrained, communication links are lossy and the gadgets utilize a lot of novel IoT technologies. The intrusion detection framework (IDS) has been broadly utilized by people, business and associations for their PC networks security. As cyber intrusions are getting more refined and being propelled at a bigger scope and across various stages, an intrusion detection system would be more powerful in the event that it works with different IDSs. For instance, IDS hosts can trade resources, for example, data alarms, network traffic, signature and its share signature data sets. Such a framework is indicated as a collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS). Despite promising advantages of CIDS, the basic trust behind sharing of assets stays a significant concern. Specifically, an assailant host may participate in a collaborative oriented IDS framework network and give wrong or malignant signatures. Also, a host condition might be messed with to adjust the information documents that really store signature. The main objective is to review intrusion detection framework design for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based IoT. Plan of such framework will help in making sure about IoT network and inhibits network intrusion. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; IDS; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection system; IoT",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123614941

Financial institutions need to deploy artificial intelligence technologies to evolve for the next step of this growing digital business, and they require a transformation of process and methods where models based on deep learning could be a tool to implement to prevent financial crime. However, those processes use large computational resources that require edge–cloud computing because to implement facial recognition, financial institutions need to connect IoT and mobile devices. Thus, this chapter aims to explore a mechanism for deep learning-based facial recognition to improve customer identification in financial institutions on a hybrid architecture. We propose a model that integrates traditional classifiers with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to facial recognition involving visual sequences or different image sources as social media as a tool for financial institutions. In this chapter, we propose a hybrid architecture between the edge and cloud computing, which catalyzes the use of these face detection tools in personalized services. Our results show that the traditional models and deep learning integration achieve optimization of searching processes and facial recognition, but some methods work better than others, possibly by features of datasets and architecture infrastructure. In this case, we integrated machine learning architectures that facilitate the management of the facial recognition process to financial institutions and achieve better computational efficiency. We conclude that the combination of deep learning tools and face recognition systems not only needs tuning and training CNN parameters to enhance the tool’s accuracy and evolution, but also those tools require an architecture that optimizes its performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud computing; Deep learning; Edge computing; Facial recognition; Financial services; Hybrid architecture","Computational efficiency; Computer architecture; Convolutional neural networks; Crime; Deep learning; Edge computing; Face recognition; Sales; Cloud-computing; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Edge computing; Emerging markets; Facial recognition; Financial institution; Financial service; Hybrid architectures; Personalized service; Network architecture",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123600258

However, the literature has focused on specific markets and algorithms so far, but it is unclear what happens across algorithms and markets. To analyze the business and economic impact of pricing algorithms, we build a computational model that considers two sophisticated AI algorithms (Q-learning and Particle Swarm Optimization) competing in prices in three different market structures (Logit, Hotelling, and linear demand models). From a social perspective, we find that PSO outperforms Q-learning, which tends to set supracompetitive prices. However, small changes in the algorithm designs may drive them to set more competitive prices, implying that a proper analysis of algorithmic competition requires considering the details of the algorithms and the market structure. When firms compete on algorithms, algorithms may generate price dispersion. Additionally, when facing a traditional competitor that uses a best-response function, algorithms tend to set supracompetitive prices, and both firms earn extra profits, but the traditional competitor benefits the most. Overall, the article contributes to understanding algorithmic competition, discusses implications for managers and policymakers, and identifies opportunities for future research. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The rise of information and communication technologies, which supports knowledge-intensive activities, has also radically transformed value capture across GVCs and raises the bar for value-creating opportunities as a new generation of technologies emerges. Of particular relevance to GVCs is the rise of digital technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. These technologies promise to herald a new era of connectedness, collaboration, and innovation, affording significant growth opportunities for GVCs. Digital platforms will play a key role for GVCs in orchestrating such value-creating opportunities. There remains a lack of empirical understanding of how digital platforms can enable GVC strategy. The study seeks to address this question by reviewing the digital platform literature to support key GVC strategy learnings.

Specifically, this study focuses on AI as the technology adopted by companies to promote Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A structured literature review has been conducted on 94 articles published from 1990 to 2021 in ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. This study develops an in-depth review of the literature on the main articles arguing about these issues. The findings highlight the increasing relevance of AI in the water, energy, and food industries individually considered, but the study of AI as a connector between water, energy, and food to achieve SDGs is still under investigation. Research on AI for WEF nexus management has adopted mostly a technical perspective, neglecting the relevance of management tools and the business model concept. Most of the articles did not adopt a specific theoretical lens, but scholars recognize the need to adopt a multi-stakeholder approach and the important role played by AI and other digital technologies to address the WEF nexus challenge. This study proposes an integrated approach for managing the nexus through AI technologies to meet sustainable and responsible business models. The gap between research and policy making could be filled by combining scientific data and policy needs with inclusive tools that are technically viable for sustainable resource utilization. © 2022 by the authors.

Over the past decade, researchers have done an exhaustive study to understand the concept of CE and its realized values both financially and environmentally on organizations that have traditional business models based on linear consumption. For understanding the transitional phenomena completely, the paper aims to review the current and emerging research trends in CE to ascertain future direction. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted on 91 articles published in the study area during the past decade (2016–2021) in renowned peer-reviewed journals. The criteria set to review literature are based on the following assortment: CE drivers, CE barriers, definitions by different authors, yearly distribution of the publication, research publisher and journals, google citation and methodology used in the selected research articles. Findings: The study suggests that researchers from the selected years are keen to understand the transition and its critical factors by bringing forward frameworks and incorporating CE with digital technologies. The digital technology implied are Industrial Technology (IR) 4.0, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Data Analytics to increase organizational and environmental performance. CE researchers need to use empirical testing in different sectors to understand and bring forward more improvised business models and practices according to the dynamics of the industry. Originality/value: The literature review suggests gaps exist to integrate the micro, meso and macro levels to get CE implementation's system-wide benefits. The study has also identified that many CE frameworks available in the literature for implementation must be empirically tested to yield performance results. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Green technology; Meta-analysis; Sustainability; Systematic literature review; Systematic review",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122815354

As indicated by Gartner’s recent study, there are around 25 billion devices and a gadget interfacing with IoT including wearables and automated vehicles to smart homes and smart cities applications. All such connected (smart) devices generate immense data that needs to be examined and analysed, to ensure that they continually learn from the available datasets and better themselves without any manual interference. This is where the prerequisite for machine learning comes into being. Several ML algorithms and techniques are introduced in a short time to easily evaluate big data measurements, increasing the IoT’s productivity. Similarly, special ML techniques, such as decision trees, clustering and neural and Bayesian networks, allow devices and gadgets to discern trends from various sources in different kinds of datasets and take appropriate decisions based on their analysis. It would really be difficult for smart devices to make smart decisions gradually without including and enforcing ML. The IoT helps to interconnect various hardware devices, such as houses, cars, electronic gadgets and other devices that are integrated with actuators, sensors and software, so that data can be collected and shared. As various organizations understand the progressive capability of the IoT, they have begun finding various obstructions they have to deliver to use it productively. Numerous organizations and businesses use ML to exploit the IoT’s latent capacity. This chapter evaluates the different methods of machine learning that deal with the challenges posed in the handling of IoT data. Note that this big data is generated through the communication of Internet of Things/smart devices, and this data stored at cloud. The taxonomy of machine learning algorithms is described in this chapter, explaining how different techniques are applied to data generated using IoT devices. It will also address the future problems of machine learning for IoT data analytics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Internet of Things (IoT)-based cloud applications; Machine learning techniques; Smart era","Automation; Bayesian networks; Big data; Data Analytics; Data handling; Decision trees; Intelligent buildings; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Automated vehicles; Gartner; Internet of thing -based cloud application; Learn+; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Smart devices; Smart era; Smart homes; Internet of things",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122787718

In the case of the online shopping business, it’s very important to find trends in the data and get knowledge of features that helps drive the success of the business. In this research, a dataset of 12,330 records of customers has been analyzed who visited an online shopping website over a period of one year. The main objective of this research is to find features that are relevant in terms of correctly predicting the purchasing decisions made by visiting customers and build ML models which could make correct predictions on unseen data in the future. The permutation feature importance approach has been used to get the importance of features according to the output variable (Revenue). Five ML models i.e., decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extra tree (ET) classifier, Neural networks (NN), and Logistic regression (LR) have been used to make predictions on the unseen data in the future. The performance of each model has been discussed in detail using performance measurement techniques such as accuracy score, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve. RF model is the best model among all five chosen based on accuracy score of 90% and F1 score of 79% followed by extra tree classifier. Hence, our study indicates that RF model can be used by online retailing businesses for predicting consumer buying behaviour. Our research also reveals the importance of page value as a key feature for capturing online purchasing trends. This may give a clue to future businesses who can focus on this specific feature and can find key factors behind page value success which in turn will help the online shopping business. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Industries seek to integrate innovation thinking in the company, resulting in different innovation theories. However, these theories become mostly ineffective when disruptions such as pandemics, political instability, or other natural events occur. In response to such disruptions, frugal innovation has been adopted in recent years because it can maximize efficiency with fewer resources. While frugal thinking is effective from an economic perspective, not enough attention has been devoted to exploring this innovative thinking method from the perspective of other pillars of sustainability (environment and society). This article focuses on this gap to deepen the understanding of sustainable frugal innovation in a recent business environment under various theoretical perspectives (triple bottom line, diffusion of innovation, and critical success factor theories). Technology is a vehicle for innovation, so this article integrates the technological advantages of AI with sustainable frugal innovation as a driving force for its effective implementation; other existing studies are limited. Integrating AI with sustainable frugal innovation requires precise actions that can be the result of understanding AIs critical success factors from the perspectives of sustainable frugal thinking. Therefore, this article analyzes the critical success factors for AI through grey DEMATEL. A research framework has been proposed and validated with a Danish case study context. Among 24 overall common critical success factors, &#x201C;understanding the concept of AI&#x201D; and &#x201C;level of AI investment&#x201D; in sustainable frugal innovation are identified as the most influential success factors. In addition, influential connections among other overall common success factors are presented.

Data were collected from 214 SMEs in Malaysia. Unlike extant literature, this study proposed a dual-stage analysis involving partial least squares (PLS) technique and artificial intelligence named deep artificial neural network (ANN). The application of deep ANN architecture is used to predict 91% of accuracy for the proposed model. The results showed that perceived relative advantage, perceived cost, top management support, perceived competitor pressure, and perceived vendor pressure have a significant impact on social media marketing adoption. Furthermore, the competitive industry moderates the effects of competitive pressure and customer pressure on social media marketing adoption. The results of the study extend the literature on social media marketing by illustrating the influence of technological, organizational, and environmental (TOE) factors on social media marketing adoption among SMEs concerning the extent of industry competition.

Although there is a large amount of literature on demand forecasting, there is a lack of research about how marketing strategies such as advertising and other promotional activities affect demand. Therefore, an accurate demand-forecasting model can make significant academic and practical contributions for business sustainability. The purpose of this article is to evaluate machine learning methods to provide accuracy in forecasting demand based on advertising expenses. The study focuses on a prediction mechanism based on several Machine Learning techniques—Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and deep learning techniques—Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),—to deal with demand forecasting based on advertising expenses. Deep learning is a powerful technique that can solve marketing problems based on both classification and regression algorithms. Accordingly, a television manufacturer’s real market dataset consisting of advertising expenditures, sales and demand forecasting via chosen machine learning methods was analyzed and compared in terms of the accuracy of demand forecasting. As a result, Long Short Term Memory has been found to be superior to other models in providing highly accurate prediction results for demand forecasting based on advertising expenses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Advertisement; Demand forecasting; Machine learning; Marketing intelligence",,Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122345244

With most of the countries imposing serious lockdowns due to the increasing number of fatalities, the social lives of millions of people were affected. Although the lockdown led to an increase in network activities, online shopping, and social network usage, it also raised questions On the mental wellness of society. Interestingly, excessive usage of social networks also witnessed humor traveling across the Internet in the form of Internet Memes during the lockdown period. Humor is known to affect our well-being, decision-making, and psychological systems. In this paper, we have analyzed the Internet Meme activity in Social Networks during the COVID-19 Lockdown period. As humor is known to relieve individuals from psychological stress, it is necessary to understand how human beings adopted Internet Memes for coping up with the lockdown stress and stress-relieving mechanism during the lockdown period. In this paper, we have considered thirty popular memes and the increase in the number of their captions within the period (September 2017 to August 2020). An increase in Internet Meme activity since the lockdown period (March 2020) depicts an increase in online social behavior. We analyze the internet meme activity in social networks during the COVID-19 lockdown period using random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and instance-based learning algorithms followed by data visualization using line graph and Heat Map (8 & 15 clustered). We also compared the performance of the models using evaluation parameters like mean absolute error, root-mean-squared error & Kappa statistics and observed that random forest and instance-based learning algorithms perform better than multi-layer perceptrons. The result indicates that random forest and instance-based learning classifiers are having near perfect classification tendencies whereas multi-layer perceptrons showed around 97% classification accuracy. © 2021 The Author(s).

It usually includes three jointly related aspects of: occasion, person and clothing. Nowadays, social media platforms allow users to interact with each other online to share opinions and information. The use of social media sites such as Instagram has already spread to almost every fashion brand and been evaluated as business take-off tools. With the heightened use of social media as a means of marketing communication for fashion brands, it has become necessary to empirically analyse and extract fashion knowledge from them. Thus, social brands are investing on them. In this way, they can understand the consumer's preferences. This change is also having a significant impact on social media data analysis. To solve this issue, the Deep learning (DL) methods are proven to be effective solutions due to their automatic learning capability. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied DL for analysing fashion knowledge from social media data. Hence, this contribution outlines DL-based techniques for social media data related to fashion domain. In this study, a review of the dataset within the fashion world and the DL methods applied on, it is presented to help out new researchers interested in this subject. In particular, five different tasks will be considered: Object Detection, that includes Clothes Landmark Detection, Clothes Parsing and Product Retrieval, Fashion Classification, Clothes Generation, Automatic Fashion Knowledge Extraction and Clothes Recommendation. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to underline the multiple applications within the fashion world using deep learning techniques. However, this review does not cover all the methods used: in fact, only Deep Learning methods have been analyzed. This choice was made since, given the huge amount of fashion social media data that has been collected, Deep Learning methods achieve the best performance both in terms of accuracy and time. Limitations point towards unexplored areas for future investigations, serving as useful guidelines for future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; clothes classification; deep learning; fashion; fashion datasets; fashion recommendation; generative adversarial networks; machine learning; neural networks; object detection; object parsing; product retrieval; social media","Classification (of information); Deep learning; E-learning; Extraction; Generative adversarial networks; Job analysis; Object detection; Object recognition; Clothes classification; Deep learning; Fashion; Fashion dataset; Fashion recommendation; Machine-learning; Multimedium web site; Neural-networks; Object parsing; Objects detection; Product retrieval; Social media; Social networking (online); Systematic; Task analysis; Web-sites; Social networking (online)",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122063245

The cost of business disruption combined with lingering COVID-19 costs has placed many public hospitals on a course to insolvency. To quickly return to financial stability, hospitals should implement efficiency measure. An average technical efficiency (ATE) model made up of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) for assessing efficiency in public hospitals during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is offered. The DEA method is a non-parametric method that requires no information other than the input and output quantities. SFA is a parametric method that considers stochastic noise in data and allows statistical testing of hypotheses about production structure and degree of inefficiency. The rationale for using these two competing approaches is to balance each method’s strengths, weaknesses and introduce a novel integrated approach. To show the applicability and efficacy of the proposed hybrid VRS-CRS-SFA (VCS) model, a case study is presented. © 2021 by the authors.

O & M engineers determine how services are running and the bearing capacity of a data center by checking the operating states of devices. However, this method cannot reflect the real transmission status of business data; therefore, engineers cannot fully comprehensively perceive the overall running conditions of businesses. In this paper, ERSPAN (Encapsulated Remote Switch Port Analyzer) technology is applied to deliver stream matching rules in the forwarding path of TCP packets and mirror the TCP packets into the network O & M AI collector, which is used to conduct an in-depth analysis on the TCP packets, collect traffic statistics, recapture the forwarding path, carry out delayed computing, and identify applications. This enables O & M engineers to comprehensively perceive the service bearing status in a data center, and form a tightly coupled correlation model between networks and services through end-to-end visualized modeling, providing comprehensive technical support for data center optimization and early warning of network risks. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Hence, how to predict partner transformation is a consistent focus in the industry. In this paper, we use an AI (Artificial Intelligence) relevant algorithm to analyze partner’s digital transformation issues and propose a novel method, named the hybrid VKR (VAE, K‐means, and random forest) algorithm, to predict partner transformation. We apply our algorithm to partner transformation issues. First, we show the prediction of about 5980 partners from 25689 partners, who are transformed and sorted according to important indicators. Secondly, we recap the tremendous effort that was required by the company to obtain high‐quality results for economic change when a partner is transforming along with one or many of the transformation dimensions. Finally, we identify unethical behavior by looking through deal transaction data. Overall, our work sheds light on several potential problems in partner transformation and calls for improved scientific practices in this area. © 2021 by the authors.

The dataset, which was referred to is based on consumption data from 2015 to 2019, included approximately 500 goods. Based on a series of data pre-processing activities, the top ten (10) essential medicines most used were chosen, namely cotri-moxazole 480 mg, amoxicillin 250 mg, paracetamol 500 mg, oral rehydration salts (O.R.S) sachet 20.5 g, chlorpheniramine 4 mg, nevirapine 200 mg, aminophylline 100 mg, artemether 20 mg + lumefantrine (AL) 120 mg, Cromoglycate ophthalmic. Our study concentrated on the application of machine learning (ML) to forecast future trends in the demand for essential drugs in Rwanda. The following models were created and applied: linear regression, artificial neural network, and random forest. The random forest was able to predict 10 selected medicines with an accuracy of 88 percent with the train set and 76 percent with the test set, and it can thus be used to forecast future demand based on past consumption data by inputting a month, year, district, and medicine name. According to our findings, the random Forest model performed well as a forecasting model for the demand for essential medicines. Finally, data-driven predictive modeling with machine learning (ML) could become the cornerstone of health supply chain planning and operational management. © 2021 by the authors.

The most important feature of social networks is the rapid sharing of information. In this context, users often share fake news without even knowing it. Fake news affects people's daily lives and its consequences can range from mere disturbing to misleading societies or even countries. The aim of this study was to provide a literature review that investigates how artificial intelligence tools are used in detecting fake news on social media and how successful they are in different fields. The study was developed using the methodology presented by Keela (2007), which is a formal methodology in computer science. The results of the study show that artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning and deep learning are widely used to develop systems for detecting fake news in various fields such as politics, sports, business, etc. and that these two tools have proven to be effective in classifying fake news. This study is intended to guide researchers as well as people involved in this field. It is believed that this study will help fill a gap in this field by presenting the main tools used for this purpose and shed light on further research. It is also hoped that this study will be a guide for researchers and individuals interested in the detection of fake news. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Fake news detection; Machine learning; Social networks",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121562210

Future 6G networks will feature even more flexible mobile network deployment driven by spectrum and infrastructure sharing among the operators. In this chapter, we propose a new multi-layer framework for 6G with decoupled operators and infrastructure planes. The proposed framework provides a flexibility of network configuration for multiple operators in condition of open spectrum and infrastructure market by using a multi-dimensional matrix representation of the data flows. In particular, the proposed model supports the dynamic switching of the operator and multi-operator service provision for the end users. As a case study, we have developed an AI-based workflow for the dynamic spectrum allocation among multiple mobile network operators. The key advantage of the proposed workflow is that it can be adjusted to the different combinations of the data flows and thus can be suitable for the spectrum allocation among multiple operators. The intelligent capabilities of the proposed workflow are provided by the deep recurrent neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture.

Consequently, a growing number of entrepreneurs have incorporated these technological advancements (henceforth called advanced technologies) in their start-up ventures seeking investment from crowdfunding platforms. Due to the complex and emerging nature of these advanced technologies, little is known about whether involving these latest technology transformations in a crowdfunding project could create a strategic advantage over other projects in their conversations about funding acquisition with the general public. Through the empirical analyses of project descriptions and success rate from the data of two leading crowdfunding platforms, we analyzed the strategic importance of highlighting a single or multiple trendy topics on the funding outcomes—both the amount of funding pledged and the additional dollars pledged to a project. Our results suggest that crowdfunding projects featuring a trendy technology transformation are likely to achieve more funding, thus a better success rate of the project proposal, compared to the non-trendy projects. This relationship appears to be highly significant on Kickstarter and marginally significant on Indiegogo. Such findings expand the current theoretical understanding on technological crowdfunding and provide strategic implications for the entrepreneurs in term of the composition of their fundraising conversations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced technology terms; Crowdfunding; Language Expectancy Theory (LET)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121350328

The purpose of the research is to consider the contradiction between the need to increase labor productivity and the development of technological innovations, which include the development of artificial intelligence and ensuring effective employment. The research was conducted using the method of in-depth interviews, content analysis of documents and analysis of statistical data. The research is based on the concept of human capital development and aims at finding opportunities to improve the well-being of people, improve the quality of the workforce, including through improving their well-being based on increasing productivity and skill levels. The research has shown that the development of artificial intelligence is indeed a factor in the growth of labor productivity. However, the uneven development of the countries and regions of the Russian Federation impedes the development of modern technologies and the labor productivity accordingly. The analysis showed that the forecasts of employment change in connection with the development of artificial intelligence do not always coincide, which is also explained by the uneven development. On the example of the Kemerovo region, it is shown that the level of business inclusion in the development of artificial intelligence technologies is very low, which does not form the need for scientific and practical study of the possibilities of using AI in the economy of the industrial region.

To prove that the efficiency of cooperation processes in modern enterprises is limited (moderate), we calculated the correlation between the level of inter-enterprise clustering cooperation and the indicators of the ease of doing business. We sampled several groups of five countries with different levels of digital competitiveness (according to 2020 data). We proved that the efficiency of business cooperation is currently limited (average correlation with the ease of doing business indicators—58.28%). However, it can be increased by using artificial intelligence (average correlation with the ease of doing business indicators—53.84%). For this purpose, we developed the “smart cooperation” concept that would optimize decision-making in business cooperation via artificial intelligence. Within this concept, artificial intelligence allows evaluating the current performance of the enterprise, determining the feasibility and efficiency of various cooperation options, predicting the performance of the enterprise under various cooperation options, and providing smart support for choosing or changing options, as well as terminating cooperation altogether. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Business cooperation; Decision-making; Optimization; “Smart cooperation”",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120878340

Nowadays, there is a need for increased investment in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence), which can be applied to the development of drugs and vaccines and the management of related services and resources. Russia sees the unleashing of this potential as a strategic task in the development of the national economy. In this regard, it is necessary to mention the need to stimulate private sector investment in innovation, state support measures for scientific research and development, and the active interaction and cooperation between the government and business. The “Science” project aims to develop the scientific potential of the country, including the expansion of opportunities for scientific and scientific-industrial cooperation. Science has become an integral part of modern society. Any average person understands that any complex problem can be solved only with the help of science, which is intended for this.

Therefore, it is highly desirable to put in place intelligent preventive maintenance measures to diagnose and evaluate the condition of power transformers. Although conventional methods have achieved success in detecting problems associated with power transformers, their adoption rate in practical environments is still far from universal. The advent of Computational Intelligence (CI) models offers useful potential to complement the existing diagnostic practices of power transformers. In this paper, we provide a review on various computational intelligence techniques for fault detection and diagnosis pertaining to preventive maintenance of power transformers. An overview of each representative CI approach is presented to facilitate researchers in selecting an appropriate method for a specific problem at hand. We carry out a broad discussion on numerous concerns and challenges that are missing from the current literature, which, nevertheless, need to be addressed seriously. We identify the research gaps in the literature, and suggest the way forward in research that will in the long run enhance power system reliability by embracing CI approaches into business operations in an effort to realize the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) advocated by the United Nation, primarily SDG7: Clean and Affordable Energy and SDG9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Computational Intelligence; Fault detection and diagnosis; Power transformer; Preventive maintenance","Artificial intelligence; Electric power transmission; Fault detection; Preventive maintenance; Computational intelligence techniques; Condition; Conventional methods; Fault detection and diagnosis; Intelligence models; Power supply; Power transmission and distributions; Power transmission systems; Power-distribution system; Transmission and distribution systems; Power transformers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120624587

The intervention started with an Organizational Network Analysis regarding informal and spontaneous communication from which skills and ideas arise: this is the starting point that allows the HR Team to take decisions and outline strategies to support growth. Then, a Sentiment Analysis was performed, in order to track and monitor the climate in different clusters within the company, by mapping sentiment through natural language processing algorithms (all data anonymized). This step also opened to a Tensions Analysis targeting expressions of anger or misalignment with the corporate culture. As a further step, an Employees Potential Chart was developed. As an output of this phase, the HR Team was provided with essential metrics such as performance peaks, relational networks, communication and collaboration among teams and departments, key competencies, and skills. Then, a learning and development plan based on people analytics was designed: the main elements were interactive tutorials and immersive online experiences made by a multimedia and visual storytelling approach, as well as an extensive interaction within an escape room animated also by realistic avatars. A number of other methodologies were introduced as a further step: first of all training on-the-job, coaching, and mentoring. All the interventions were based on a large amount of people analytics collected from gamified activities, allowing for micro-targeted and highly precise interventions that are very innovative in the field of learning and development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","e-REAL; Interactive learning; People analytics",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119858996

Such opinions are widely generated on the internet by fake viewers, also called fraudsters. They write deceptive reviews that purport to reflect actual user experience either to promote some products or to defame others. They also target the reputations of e-businesses. Their aim is to mislead customers to make a wrong purchase decision by selecting undesired products. Such reviewers are often paid by rival e-business companies to compose positive reviews of their products and/or negative reviews of other companies’ products. The main objective of this paper is to detect, analyze and calculate the difference between fake and truthful product reviews. To do this, the methodology has planned to have seven phases: reviewing online products, analyzing features through linguistic enquiry and word count (LIWC), preprocessing the data to clean and normalize them, embedding words (Word2Vec) and analyzing performance using artificial deep-learning algorithms for classifying fake and truthful reviews. Two deep-learning neural network models have been evaluated based on standard Yelp product reviews. These models are bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results from comparing the performance of the two models showed that the BiLSTM model provided higher accuracy for detecting fake reviews than the CNN model. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Despite the fact that some of the vaccines of the pandemic are now available, immediately after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the second wave of the pandemic has now started and causes a lot of lives and grounds a lot of businesses that have resumed. Therefore, in order to contain its further spread among humans, testing and screening of a large number of suspected COVID-19 cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment measures are of high priority to all governments around the world. However, most of the countries are facing inadequate and standard laboratories for testing a large number of suspected COVID-19 cases in their countries despite the fact that the virus is now endemic like other communicable diseases. Therefore, alternatives in non-medical diagnosis of COVID-19 techniques using artificial intelligence which include deep learning, data mining, machine learning, expert system, software agent, and other techniques are urgently needed in the cause of the diagnosis, containing and combatting the further spread of the pandemic. In this study, deep learning algorithms were used to develop models for predicting COVID-19 using chest x-ray images, and models were able to extract COVID-19 imagery features and provide clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test with a view to saving time, thereby complementing COVID-19 testing laboratories. ResNet50-based model was found to have the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC score of 99%, 89%, and 96%, respectively. In contrast, EfficientNet B4-based model was found to have the highest specificity of 89%.

The use of cloud computing has realized the rapid increase of information in every field and the need for a centralized location for processing efficiently. This cloud is nowadays highly affected by internal threats of the user. Sensitive applications such as banking, hospital, and business are more likely affected by real user threats. An intruder is presented as a user and set as a member of the network. After becoming an insider in the network, they will try to attack or steal sensitive data during information sharing or conversation. The major issue in today's technological development is identifying the insider threat in the cloud network. When data are lost, compromising cloud users is difficult. Privacy and security are not ensured, and then, the usage of the cloud is not trusted. Several solutions are available for the external security of the cloud network. However, insider or internal threats need to be addressed. In this research work, we focus on a solution for identifying an insider attack using the artificial intelligence technique. An insider attack is possible by using nodes of weak users’ systems. They will log in using a weak user id, connect to a network, and pretend to be a trusted node. Then, they can easily attack and hack information as an insider, and identifying them is very difficult. These types of attacks need intelligent solutions. A machine learning approach is widely used for security issues. To date, the existing lags can classify the attackers accurately. This information hijacking process is very absurd, which motivates young researchers to provide a solution for internal threats. In our proposed work, we track the attackers using a user interaction behavior pattern and deep learning technique. The usage of mouse movements and clicks and keystrokes of the real user is stored in a database. The deep belief neural network is designed using a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) so that the layer of RBM communicates with the previous and subsequent layers. The result is evaluated using a Cooja simulator based on the cloud environment. The accuracy and F-measure are highly improved compared with when using the existing long short-term memory and support vector machine. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Using data collected through 20 semi-structured interviews with business managers and engineers involved in AI adoption for B2B marketing activities, as well as academic experts in the field of AI, this paper discusses how AI adoption priorities and motives shape the power dynamics amongst the various network actors, including focal firms, AI suppliers and tech giant companies. The findings show that, in the context of AI adoption in B2B, both technology and expertise are key sources of power, and that data creates and perpetuates power negotiations and renegotiations in the network.

Digital transformation is the process of turning a classical industry into a data-driven industry that leverages new technologies and opportunities arising from data science, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. For pharma to successfully maneuver this digital transformation, changes to strategy, platforms, and cultures are necessary. Within this paper, we review the current challenges for the digital transformation of the pharma enterprise and offer a solution in form of a data centric architecture powered by a digital hub and Self-reporting data assets (SRDAs). SRDAs represents an efficient subset of the more generic FAIR – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable – principles in pharma, as they were developed explicitly to solve important data sharing and reuse cases in this domain. Along with multiple use cases, we show how SRDAs harmonize information and make it accessible in a reusable fashion to data scientists. We present a variety of dashboards that can be created on a solid foundation of SRDAs and outline future business benefits that can follow from this transformative technology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced analytics; Allotrope; Digital transformation; Digitalization; FAIR data; Pharma; SRDA",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118973363

It initiates a discussion on the positioning of the Industry Commons Ecosystem (ICE) with respect to current research directions in advanced manufacturing and production systems that shape advances in engineering and technology, novel business models and innovation breakthroughs. The potential value of data sharing across industrial domains is estimated at over $100 billion, particularly in view of optimising manufacturing processes. Data sharing across domains however faces a series of well-documented challenges associated with the lack of semantic interoperability and related standards, management of trust and sustainability. Solving bottlenecks in data sharing requires a systemic approach to data management, which can account for all aspects of data use, levels of application, attribution and dynamic exchanges. In this paper we propose a high-level ecosystem approach that integrates societal values with digital affordances of industry’s cognitive-assisted processes, remote interfacing, hybrid applications and large-scale value networks. Early development of an Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES) is presented as the key enabling framework for Industry Commons interoperability and a series of enabling frameworks form the basis of future research directions in Trusted Data Sharing and Closed-Loop Lifecycle Management for greater sustainability.

To develop less biased AIRS, collaboration between HR managers and AI developers for training algorithms and exploring algorithmic biases is vital. Using an exploratory research design, 35 HR managers and AI developers globally were interviewed to understand the role of knowledge sharing during their collaboration in mitigating biases in AIRS.

Presently, the emergence of coronavirus COVID-19 which has rightly been declared a global pandemic resulting in so many deaths, confusion as well as huge economic losses is a challenge. It has been suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) in conjunction with different Government authorities of the world and non-governmental organizations, that efforts to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic should rely principally on measures such as social distancing, identification of infected persons, tracing of possible contacts as well as effective isolation of such person(s) for subsequent medical treatment. The aim of this study is to provide a framework for monitoring Movements of Pandemic Disease Patients and predicting their next geographical locations given the recent trend of infected COVID-19 patients absconding from isolation centres as evidenced in the Nigerian case. The methodology for this study, proposes a system architecture incorporating GPS (Global Positioning System) and Assisted-GPS technologies for monitoring the geographical movements of COVID-19 patients and recording of their movement Trajectory Datasets on the assumption that they are assigned with GPS-enabled devices such as smartphones. Accordingly, fifteen (15) participants (patients) were selected for this study based on the criteria of residency and business activity location. The ensuing participants movements generated 157, 218 Trajectory datasets during a period of 3 weeks. With this dataset, mining of the movement trace, Stay Points (hot spots), relationships, and the prediction of the next probable geographical location of a COVID-19 patient was realized by the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Mining techniques such as supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting regression(XGBR) as well as density-based clustering methods (i.e., DBSCAN) for the computation of Stay Points (hot spots) of COVID-19 patient. The result of this study showed clearly that it is possible to determine the Stay Points (hot spots) of a COVID-19 patient. In addition, this study demonstrated the possibility of predicting the next probable geographical location of a COVID-19 patient. Correspondingly, Six Machine Learning models (i.e., MLR, kNN, DTR, RFR, GBR, and XGBR) were compared for efficiency, in determining the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient. The result showed that the DTR model performed better compared to other models (i.e., MLR, kNN, RFR, GBR, XGBR) based on four evaluation matrices (i.e., ACCURACY, MAE, MSE, and R2) used. It is recommended that less developed Countries consider adopting this framework as a policy initiative for implementation at this burgeoning phase of COVID-19 infection and beyond. The same applies to the developed Countries. There is indication that GPS Trajectory dataset and Machine Learning algorithms as applied in this paper, appear to possess the potential of performing optimally in a real-life situation of monitoring a COVID-19 patient. This paper is unique given its ability to predict the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient. In the review of extant literature, prediction of the next probable location of a COVID-19 patient was not in evidence using the same Machine Learning algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Covid-19; Data mining; Machine learning; Movement; Pandemic; Trajectory dataset","Data mining; Decision trees; Diseases; Forecasting; Global positioning system; Linear regression; Location; Logistic regression; Losses; Nearest neighbor search; Supervised learning; Covid-19; Decision tree regression; Geographical locations; Gradient boosting; Hotspots; Machine learning algorithms; Movement; Multiple linear regressions; Pandemic; Trajectory dataset; Trajectories",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118169345

In the meantime, ad-fraud undertaken by cybercriminals cost $42 billion in 2019 and could reach $100 billion by 2023. However, while digital advertisers continue to wrestle with how to effectively counteract ad-fraud, the topic of advertising fraud itself has received little academic attention. Here, we investigate this gap between practice and research through an exploration of ad-fraud communities. Our research implemented a multimethod approach for data collection in a longitudinal (18 months, October 2017 to April 2019) online investigation of this phenomenon. Integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis, we examined (1) internal interactions within ad-fraud communities and (2) ad-fraud communities’ performance and growth. Our online investigation extends our conceptual understanding of ad-fraud and explains how ad-fraud communities innovate. Our findings indicate that capabilities enacted by some communities foster requisite variety and enable the coordination of complex, iterative, and incremental dynamics (cocreation of artificial intelligence-based bots, customer involvement, and reinforcing capabilities). This research has both theoretical and practical implications for innovation in cybercriminal communities. Furthermore, we provide practical guidance for policy-makers and advertisers regarding how to improve their response to business threats. Indeed, a better understanding of how ad-fraud communities innovate enables organizations to develop countermeasures and intelligence capabilities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Ad-fraud; Cybercrime; Multimethod approach; Online communities","Computer crime; Coordination reactions; Marketing; Ad-fraud; Advertising frauds; Conceptual understanding; Cyber-crimes; Cybercriminals; Data collection; Digital advertizing; Multi-method approach; Performance; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Crime; advertising; crime; innovation; Internet; research method",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117688992

Decision support systems (DSS) are systems that gather information from various sources, facilitate its organization and analysis in a way that is useful for a particular decision, and provide a good interface through which users can navigate and interact easily. An important characteristic of DSS is that it facilitates the identification, analysis, and evaluation of the decision process, using decision models based on simple rules or complex mathematical models. On the other hand, the construction of this type of system implies having the support of decision-makers in all phases, as well as the allocation of the necessary resources.

Based on a deep learning approach, we propose a prototype of an on-site customer profiling and hyper-personalization system (OSCPHPS) targeted at marketing professionals. We propose an AI platform to create customer profiles during their physical presence in stores. The idea of the OSCPHPS prototype is to automatically detect and gather customer data directly from the store, essentially completing customer profiles containing gender, age, personality, emotions, and products they interacted with or bought, irrespective of where they are in the store. Each buying operation could generate an anonymous customer profile. Therefore, for every product sold, the system will track multiple customer-generated profiles of the people who bought that product. These kinds of data offer endless further possibilities for the business. Through a configurational study conducted via fsQCA methodology, we assessed the interest in the OSCPHPS prototype on the part of marketing managers of clothes & fashion stores located in different European countries. Based on these live generated profiles, we could further enhance the OSCPHPS system by adding support for customer segmentation, strategic product campaigns, live product recommendation, analysis of emotions toward a product or a category of products, sales forecasts, and personalized store space enhancements based on augmented reality, customer exploratory statistics and customer purchasing patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Deep learning; Facial recognition; Hyper-personalization","Augmented reality; Commerce; Computer vision; Deep learning; Face recognition; Customer profiles; Customer profiling; Deep learning; Facial recognition; Hyper-personalization; Learning approach; On-site customers; Personalization systems; Personalizations; System prototype; Sales; artificial intelligence; commodity market; computer simulation; consumption behavior; information and communication technology; marketing; social behavior; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117363793

In this regard, Sewer Overflow (SO) has been considered as a detrimental threat to our environment and health, which results from the wastewater discharge into the environment. In order to grapple with such deleterious phenomenon, numerous studies have been conducted; however, there has not been any review paper that provides the researchers undertaking research in this area with the following inclusive picture: (1) detailed-scientometric analysis of the research undertaken hitherto, (2) the types of methodologies used in the previous studies, (3) the aspects of environment impacted by the SO occurrence, and (4) the gaps existing in the relative literature together with the potential future works to be undertaken. Based on the comprehensive review undertaken, it is observed that simulation and artificial intelligence-based methods have been the most popular approaches. In addition, it has come to the attention that the detrimental impacts associated with the SO are fourfold as follows: air, quality of water, soil, and business and structure. Among these, the majority of the studies' focus have been tilted towards the impact of SO on the quality of ground water. The outcomes of this state-of-the-art review provides the researchers and environmental engineers with inclusive hindsight in dealing with such serious issue, which in turn, this culminates in a significant improvement in our environment as well as humans’ well-beings. © 2021","Artificial intelligence; Environmental concerns; Scientometric analysis; Sewer overflows; Sewer systems","ground water; heavy metal; storm water; ground water; business; detection method; literature review; simulation; stormwater; wastewater; wastewater treatment; air quality; artificial intelligence; bibliometrics; environmental management; Review; scientometrics; sewer; wastewater; water quality; water supply; artificial intelligence; human; sewage; Artificial Intelligence; Groundwater; Humans; Sewage; Waste Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117161229

Data science integrates the conventions of econometrics with the technological elements of data science. It make use of machine learning (ML), predictive and prescriptive analytics to effectively understand financial data and solve related problems. Smart technologies for SMEs enable allows the firm to get smarter with their processes and offers efficient operations. At the same time, it is needed to develop an effective tool which can assist small to medium sized enterprises to forecast business failure as well as financial crisis. AI becomes a familiar tool for several businesses due to the fact that it concentrates on the design of intelligent decision making tools to solve particular real time problems. With this motivation, this paper presents a new AI based optimal functional link neural network (FLNN) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model for SMEs. The proposed model involves preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter tuning. At the initial stage, the financial data of the enterprises are collected and are preprocessed to enhance the quality of the data. Besides, a novel chaotic grasshopper optimization algorithm (CGOA) based feature selection technique is applied for the optimal selection of features. Moreover, functional link neural network (FLNN) model is employed for the classification of the feature reduced data. Finally, the efficiency of the FLNN model can be improvised by the use of cat swarm optimizer (CSO) algorithm. A detailed experimental validation process takes place on Polish dataset to ensure the performance of the presented model. The experimental studies demonstrated that the CGOA-FLNN-CSO model has accomplished maximum prediction accuracy of 98.830%, 92.100%, and 95.220% on the applied Polish dataset Year I-III respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Business activities are increasingly carried out on special platforms, the adoption of the law “On Electronic Commerce,” which came into force on January 1, 2019, in China, in addition to regulating public relations arising in the process of conducting electronic commercial activities, also settled the issue related to the methods of dispute resolution. Modern electronic technologies make it possible to simplify the process of concluding transactions, so dispute resolution mechanisms should also comply with these trends. China was the first to introduce digital tools in all dispute resolution mechanisms, both in the judicial system and in alternative dispute resolution methods. The research purpose of this article is to study various methods of dispute resolution, which are used in the process of modern electronic technologies. It is proved that their application: (1) increases the economic attractiveness of China for business activities; (2) dispute resolution methods acquire such qualities as efficiency, transparency, and accessibility; (3) the accumulation of various types of activity on electronic trading platforms makes them more attractive not only for Chinese citizens, but also for foreign persons.

The correct selection of personnel is key to the success of a business because regardless of the outstanding business strategy, those who put it into practice are most important. A carefully developed strategy is as bad as having no strategy if the wrong person is placed in the wrong position. There are no studies to predict the competency of job applicants based on dimensional values such as level of knowledge, self-motivation, self-concern and role perception. This study proposes a prediction model that uses AI (Artificial Intelligence), this includes a quantitative mathematical model that identifies the level of personnel competency to optimize job performance. The model verifies the discrete and continuous relationship between competency dimensions and their synergetic effects.

Failing to do so may cause a serious loss of reputation as well as business. At the same time, modern network traffic has dynamic patterns, high complexity, and large volumes that make it more difficult to detect malware early. The ability to learn tasks sequentially is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Existing neurogenetic computation models with deep-learning techniques are able to detect complex patterns; however, the models have limitations, including catastrophic forgetfulness, and require intensive computational resources. As defense systems using deep-learning models require more time to learn new traffic patterns, they cannot perform fully online (on-the-fly) learning. Hence, an intelligent attack/malware detection system with on-the-fly learning capability is required. For this paper, a memory-prediction framework was adopted, and a simplified single cell assembled sequential hierarchical memory (s.SCASHM) model instead of the hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) model is proposed to speed up learning convergence to achieve on-the-fly learning. The s.SCASHM consists of a Single Neuronal Cell (SNC) model and a simplified Sequential Hierarchical Superset (SHS) platform. The s.SCASHM is implemented as the prediction engine of a user behavior analysis tool to detect insider attacks/anomalies. The experimental results show that the proposed memory model can predict users' traffic behavior with accuracy level ranging from 72% to 83% while performing on-the-fly learning. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

BI is one of the key components that persistently required for the modern high-tech companies and industries were used to handle huge amounts of data in every minute of the operations. The existing literature suggested that the lack of dynamic decision making, accuracy, and the degree of flexibility are the key limitations for handling the operational data. Many industries and companies adopted the software-based solution; however, the intelligence is there due to the dependence of the operational engagement for each of the sectors. Therefore, artificial intelligence business framework is urge to implement in the industrial and company’s larger data handling and dynamic decision making that should have the multi-agent system adopting business analyzer mod-el. Towards developing a more universal and cooperative platform, this paper proposes a business Analyzer model. It implements it in an Analyzer agent that can functionally participate in a BI Multi-Agent System (MAS). Unlike previous analyzers which are usually included in other services, this Analyzer is a stand-alone agent that adds an abstraction level to the BI model processing. We have started by defining a BI model using MAS. Building on that, we have created the Analyzer model. Then, we have suggested the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that can satisfy the Analyzer model requirements and implemented it in an Analyzer agent. The functionality and results are promising. This paper opens the road for the researchers to proceed toward universal BI model and the opportunity to implement new BI services. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Domain prediction, intent detection and entity extraction or slot fillings are the most important parts for such intelligent systems. Various traditional machine learning algorithms such as Bayesian algorithm, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, along with recent Deep Neural Network techniques, are used to predict domain, intent, and entity. Most language understanding systems process user input in a sequential order: domain is first predicted, then intent and slots are filled according to the semantic frames of the predicted domain. This pipeline approach, however, has many disadvantages including downstream error; i.e., if the system fails to predict the domain, then the system also fails to predict intent and slot. The main purpose of this paper is to mitigate the risk of downstream error propagation in traditional pipelined models and improve the predictive performance of domain, intent, and slot-all of which are critical steps for speech understanding and dialog systems-with a deep learn-ing-based single joint model trained with an adversarial approach and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The systematic experimental analysis shows significant improvements in predictive performance for domain, intent, and entity with the proposed adversarial joint model, compared to the base joint model. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Modern techniques involving Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Neural Networks and Deep learning enable extraction of high-level abstractions and provide insight into complex patterns of an order which was not possible till recently. Present paper provides an overview of the data processing and analytic methodologies used for gaining intelligence in the context of national security. Modern-day national security is threatened on two fronts. One is from external agencies, traditionally known to be hostile. The other is from terrorism and insurgency groups mostly operating within the physical boundaries of the country. The former is dominated by high-technology systems and hence intelligence in that context is mainly related to gaining information superiority about hostile systems and tactics. Dealing with the latter has to be done under a totally different framework, and solutions to these conflicts do not lie in the conventional battlefield. Objective of the present paper is to provide a perspective view of the data-related techniques and technologies used for gaining intelligence for national security in the above contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Asymmetric warfare; Electronic intelligence; Electronic warfare; Metadata tagging; Pulse deinterleaving; Strategic intelligence; Tactical intelligence","Data handling; Deep learning; Electronic warfare; Military applications; Neural networks; Asymmetric warfares; Business research; Electronic intelligence; Metadatum tagging; Modern techniques; Pulse deinterleaving; Real- time; Strategic intelligence; Tactical intelligence; Tacticals; National security",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115732458

The complexity of these processes and the resulting cognitive load of managing them may vary significantly. To decrease the cognitive load created by such decision-making efforts and to obtain better outcomes, recommendation systems carry significant potential. In order to investigate the benefits provided by decision support systems (DSS) in personal process management (PPM), we first build a constraint programming (CP) model and a prototype context-aware-mobile application employing this CP model. Then, we evaluate the application and the model via two exemplary real-world scenarios. The scenarios form the core of the experiments conducted with 50 participants. We compare the participants’ planning performances with and without the PPM system with quantitative metrics such as planning times and scenario objective values. In addition, System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaires and open-ended questions provide qualitative evaluation results. Throughout the study, we apply the Design Science Research methodology to rigorously conduct research activities by proof of concept, proof of use, and proof of value. The empirical results clearly show that our proposed model for PPM is effective, and the developed prototype solution generates positive participant comments as well as a high SUS score. Overall, the prototype PPM system with CP implementation leads to better planning in less time in the planning phase, and it lets the user do fast replanning in the execution phase, which is invaluable in dynamically changing situations such as daily activities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Business process management; Constraint programming; Design science research; Intelligent personal assistants; Personal process management","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Decision making; Decision support systems; Design; Enterprise resource management; Surveys; Cognitive loads; Constraint programming model; Context-aware mobile application; Decisions makings; Design-science researches; Personal process management; Process management; Process management systems; Research approach; System usability; Constraint programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115634506

The exponential amount of data generated by the people in their day-to-day lives results in the rise of Big Data Analytics (BDA). Cognitive computing is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system that can reduce the issues faced during BDA. On the other hand, Sentiment Analysis (SA) is employed to understand such linguistic based tweets, feature extraction, compute subjectivity and sentimental texts placed in these tweets. The application of SA on big data finds it useful for businesses to take commercial benefits insight from text-oriented content. In this view, this paper presents new cognitive computing with the big data analysis tool for SA. The proposed model involves various process such as pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. For handling big data, Hadoop Map Reduce tool is used. The proposed model initially undergoes pre-processing to remove the unwanted words. Then, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is utilized as a feature extraction technique to extract the set of feature vectors. Besides, a Binary Brain Storm Optimization (BBSO) algorithm is being used for the Feature Selection (FS) process and thereby achieving improved classification performance. Moreover, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are used as a classifier to classify the incidence of positive or negative sentiments. A comprehensive experimental results analysis ensures the better performance of the presented BBSO-FCM model on the benchmark dataset.

This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for people and enable people to care for each other. Humans have always been tool builders, and now they are supertool builders, whose inventions can improve our health, family life, education, business, the environment, and much more. The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits AI researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing.

The retailer is under pressure to re-engineer the delivery business models that address customer’s expectation for faster, low-cost, availability and contactless delivery. The existing delivery model lacks end-to-end connectivity, leading to inefficiency specifically in the urban last-mile delivery. Lack of end-to-end connectivity in the last-mile delivery leads to delayed delivery, lack of transparency, erroneous delivery, accidents, and poor performance. Delivery operator (driver) is the primary link in the highly responsive last-mile delivery. To enhance the performance, it is imperative to monitor and control the driver’s behaviour to stop many road accidents. Application of artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in enhancing the last-mile delivery and customer experience. Through the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), AI addresses the safety issue involving an algorithm to predict operator’s behaviour. The Chapter proposes a real-time alert system based on artificial intelligence, which will provide a smart solution incorporating the delivery operator’s behaviour such as driving pattern, fatigue check, eye blink, braking and curved angles and other road conditions alert notification on a real-time basis. The system will collect locational data via GPS (Global Positioning System) and generate real-time information on driver performance, assessed through mobile phone. The aim is to evaluate drivers’ behavioural patterns in terms of safe and economical driving and provide the driver with feedback and tips to improve. In the last-mile delivery, operator’s behaviour managed through this smart solution will help avoid accidents, streamline the processes and ultimately improve the customer experience for the timely delivery of the product based in UAE. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Driver behaviour; Last-mile delivery; NB-IoT; Online pharmacy","Accidents; Artificial intelligence; Automobile drivers; Costs; Global positioning system; mHealth; Roads and streets; Sales; Customer experience; Delivery models; Driver performance; End-to-end connectivity; Gps (global positioning system); Monitor and control; Poor performance; Real-time information; Advanced driver assistance systems",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114440649

This review is a part of a R&D project aiming to improve the existing codebeat platform that help developers to avoid code smells and deliver quality code. Objective This study aims to identify and investigate the current state of the art with respect to: (1) predictors used in prediction models to detect code smells, (2) machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) methods used in prediction models to detect code smells, (3) code smells analyzed in scientific literature. Our secondary objectives were to identify (4) data sets and projects used in research papers to predict code smells, (5) performance measures used to assess prediction models and (6) improvement ideas with regard to code smell detection using ML/AI. Method We conducted a systematic review using a database search in Scopus and evaluated it using the quasi-gold standard procedure to identify relevant studies. In the data sheet used to obtain data from publications we factor research questions into finer-grained ones, which are then answered on a per-publication basis. Those are then merged over a set of publications using an automated script to obtain answers to the posed research questions. Results We have identified 45 primary studies relevant to the primary objectives of this research. The results show the prediction capability of the ML/AI techniques for predicting code smells. Conclusion Only a few smells—Blob, Feature Envy, Long Method and Data Class—have received the vast majority of interest in research community. The usage of deep learning techniques is increasing. Most researchers still use source code metrics as predictors. Precision, recall and F-measure are the go-to performance metrics. There seems to be a need for modern reference data/projects sets that reflect modern constructs of programming languages. We identified various promising paths of research that have the potential to advance the state of the art in the area of code smells prediction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Code smells; Predictive modelling; Software Engineering; Systematic review",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113284334

As a rule, such projects are based on innovations and their implementation requires registration as independent enterprises. Operating in market conditions, most IT companies are forced to develop new innovative ideas and present them in the form of startups At the same time, small and medium-sized businesses interact with many external independent potential customers. Such users of information systems may subsequently become clients of such enterprises. The growth and development of these SaaS enterprises relies heavily on the average customer, which is the topic of this article, with the goal of reducing customer churn. The direction of such research is addressed in many of the rules of thumb for SaaS metrics. In these conditions, it is important to take into account the completeness of the functional interaction of SaaS customers, the authors proposed a hypothesis on the possibility of using intelligent methods for predicting customer churn using deep learning neural networks. At the same time, the needs of the stakeholders of such projects should be taken into account, the satisfaction of which occurs when interacting with an innovative IT product. To describe the interactions, the authors consider mathematical models, and also propose modeling methods. To conduct chain training, Python functionality is used, with the processing of user activity datasets.

Researchers have highlighted the importance of gaining visibility into procurement interdependencies between suppliers to develop more informed business contingency plans. However, extant methods such as supplier surveys rely on the willingness or ability of suppliers to share data and are not easily verifiable. In this article, we pose the supply chain visibility problem as a link prediction problem from the field of Machine Learning (ML) and propose the use of an automated method to detect potential links that are unknown to the buyer with Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Using a real automotive network as a test case, we show that our method performs better than existing algorithms. Additionally, we use Integrated Gradient to improve the explainability of our approach by highlighting input features that influence GNN’s decisions. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of using GNN for link prediction, outlining future research directions. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, there is a lack of research on how the unintended consequences of AI integrated business analytics (AI-BA) influence a firm’s overall competitive advantage. In this backdrop, this study aims to identify how factors, such as AI-BA opacity, suboptimal business decisions and perceived risk are responsible for a firm’s operational inefficiency and competitive disadvantage. Drawing on the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and contingency theory, the proposed research model captures the components and effects of an AI-BA opacity on a firm’s risk environment and negative performance. The data were gathered from 355 operational, mid-level and senior managers from various service sectors across all different size organisations in India. The results indicated that lack of governance, poor data quality, and inefficient training of key employees led to an AI-BA opacity. It then triggers suboptimal business decisions and higher perceived risk resulting in operational inefficiency. The findings show that operational inefficiency significantly contributes to negative sales growth and employees’ dissatisfaction, which result in a competitive disadvantage for a firm. The findings also highlight the significant moderating effect of contingency plan in the nomological chain. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Artificial intelligence; business analytics; firm dis-performance; firm’s competitiveness; operational inefficiency; Patrick Mikalef, Aleš Popovic, Jenny Eriksson Lundström and Kieran Conboy","Advanced Analytics; Competition; Opacity; Personnel training; Sales; Service industry; Business analytics; Business decisions; Competitive advantage; Contingency theory; Dynamic capabilities; Integrated business; Resource-based view; Unintended consequences; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111903831

This raises the question of how educators can introduce AI technologies to undergraduate business students while also developing their higher-order thinking skills and preparing them for the complex challenges facing today's business leaders. At the same time, we have also witnessed a growing interest in social entrepreneurship among our student population. To address both needs, we designed and implemented the “Innovation Farm,” a gamified social entrepreneurship startup project, to help students learn the concepts and applications of AI in an introductory management information systems (MIS) course. The students work in teams to propose AI-powered products and services targeting real-world social issues. The project cultivates social awareness and empathy in students, fosters innovation, and introduces them to current AI technologies while also reinforcing their understanding of MIS course content. Students found the gamified approach engaging, as they are tackling real-world social issues while also learning about innovation, collaboration, branding, and fundraising for a social startup.

This new revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is characterized by the combination of physical and digital worlds in digital ecosystems that connect the different members in the value chain from clients to suppliers and distributors. Companies are redefining their strategies based on this new paradigm to obtain a competitive advantage. They aim to achieve more efficient and flexible productive processes that can produce high-quality products at low costs, investing on mass customization to satisfy their clients. Accordingly, governments are implementing support programs that create a suitable environment for the adoption of technological innovation strategies by the companies. Although some programs may diverge in some objectives, they all aim to promote workers' skills adaptation, technological supply development, and business modernization. The Portuguese Government also released its program for Industry 4.0 support, known as Portugal i4.0, which is intended to stimulate Portuguese economy digitalization. Furthermore, in latest years, it has been supporting projects through European funds mobilizations from Portugal 2020 program. The present study analyses whether companies that received financial support from Portuguese government to implement innovative projects, within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, were able to improve economic and financial performance and competitivity gains.

Second, the proposed 2 × 2 avatar taxonomy suggests that the alignment of an avatar’s form realism and behavioral realism, across different contingencies, provides a parsimonious explanation for avatar effectiveness. Third, the authors develop an emerging theory of avatar marketing by triangulating insights from fundamental elements of avatars, a synthesis of extant research, and business practices. This framework integrates key theoretical insights, research propositions, and important managerial implications for this expanding area of marketing strategy.

In particular, the proposed optimizer utilizes an algorithmic implementation of the n-dimensional inverse transform sampling as a search strategy. No control parameters are required to be tuned, and the trade-off among exploration and exploitation is, by definition, satisfied.

It has a detrimental impact on neighborhood safety and reputation. Blight also creates low-value areas in urban centers, reduces property values and business investment, and increases unemployment. These effects make urban blight an issue of growing interest as the need to eradicate blighted properties has significantly increased worldwide. This study adopted a constructivist, socio-technical stance that combined cognitive mapping, moving averages, and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method. This methodological approach facilitated the identification of prevention strategies that control urban blight occurrences and subsequent eradication subject to seasonal constraints. Based on real-world cases, data was collected directly from a panel of urban blight experts. The members analyzed different prevention initiatives in terms of five major dimensions—governance, community involvement, economic context, territorial planning, and operations—which were previously identified during the development of a collective causal map. Practical applications of the proposed decision-support system were analyzed and validated by two independent experts from the Direção Geral do Território (General Directorate of the Territory of Portugal).

The difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution; this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund. The complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward. This article presents the random neural network (RNN) in a recurrent configuration for the 4th industrial revolution on a Fintech application; the RNN is proposed to make predictions on time series data, specifically, prices. The biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections make predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs. The model is validated against the property, stock and Fintech market: (1) UK property prices, (2) stock market indice prices, (3) cryptocurrency prices. Experimental results show that the proposed method makes accurate predictions on different investment portfolios. The prediction accuracy of the proposed RNN model is compared against long short-term memory (LSTM) and linear regression (LR) models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Fintech; Neural networks; Price predictions; Stock market","Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Fintech; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Time series; Accurate prediction; Biological modeling; Industrial revolutions; Investment portfolio; Prediction accuracy; Price prediction; Random neural network; Time-series data; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103953424

We find that conflicts may exist between profits and sustainability goals, but can be balanced by the regulators' policies and consumers' green behaviours. The framework provides support for exploring some future research opportunities. Further attention could be paid to the interactions among firms (F–F), among regulators (R–R), among consumers (C–C) and social performance improvement. In particular, innovative business models (e.g. sharing economy, social media) and new disruptive technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, big data and 5G) play vital roles in achieving sustainability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","innovative technology and business model; internal and external interaction; Production and operation decision; sustainable operations management; sustainable supply chain management","5G mobile communication systems; Self organizing maps; Academic community; Disruptive technology; Interaction framework; Multi-party interactions; Research opportunities; Social performance; State-of-the art reviews; Sustainable operations; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102787707

This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advanced technologies; artificial intelligence; human resource management; Intelligent automation; international business; robotics; systematic review",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100864122

To have a sustainable vision of their business, firms need to have a suitable decision-making process at each stage, including minute details. Our study reviews and investigates the existing research in the field of decision support systems (DSSs) and how artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have been integrated into OR. The findings of our review show how AI has contributed to decision making in the operations research field. This review presents synergies, differences, and overlaps in AI, DSSs, and OR. Furthermore, a clarification of the literature based on the approaches adopted to develop the DSS is presented along with the underlying theories. The classification has been primarily divided into two categories, i.e. theory building and application-based approaches, along with taxonomies based on the AI, DSS, and OR areas. In this review, past studies were calibrated according to prognostic capability, exploitation of large data sets, number of factors considered, development of learning capability, and validation in the decision-making framework. This paper presents gaps and future research opportunities concerning prediction and learning, decision making and optimization in view of intelligent decision making in today’s era of uncertainty.

The Delphi exercise involved 3 expert-panels, consisting of a total of 24 subject matter experts representing all important stakeholders across the intelligent building value chain. A total of 140 issues have been identified, grouped across 8 themes, and ranked, leading to the development of an ‘IoT adoption index’. A subset of the issues has been identified using two inputs from the literature, viz., key performance indicators of intelligent buildings and the business model canvas. The results can be practically used by the stakeholders while evaluating IoT systems for deployment in their projects.

Transnational corporations are hailing these gains as a ‘game changer’ for advancing environmental sustainability. Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth. At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors. These findings extend the theoretical understanding in the field of international political economy of the hidden dangers of relying on technology and corporate governance to resolve the deep unsustainability of the contemporary world order. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence; corporate governance; corporate social responsibility; global supply chains; sustainability; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090127244
