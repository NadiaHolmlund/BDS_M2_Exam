In many organizations, information systems are developed independently. The database that supports the human resource management system, for example, is developed and implemented separately from the database that supports the main production system. Different naming conventions, data types, and values in such different databases make it hard to consider if the data items from different databases refer to the same real-world objects. The problems become worse in the case that databases have different data structures; different data models. Polyglot environments may be a solution for operational systems but may turn to be problems for decision support systems. This paper presents an approach to the database integration problem. Ontology is used as a central knowledge base where data items and relationships are identified and resolved. Since the database integration process must yield perfect or close to perfect result, any mismatches or errors are not acceptable and user involvements are required. Hence, a semi-automatic approach is adopted.","Database integration; Ontology; Relational database","Database integration; Human resource management systems; Management decision-making; Operational systems; Production system; Real-world objects; Relational Database; User involvement; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Human resource management; Information science; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Database systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890096220

Several advantages and benefits for both technical and economic operation of the power system and of the electricity markets are recognized. The increasing integration of demand response and distributed generation resources, all of them mostly with small scale distributed characteristics, leads to the need of aggregating entities such as Virtual Power Players. The operation business models become more complex in the context of smart grid operation. Computational intelligence methods can be used to give a suitable solution for the resources scheduling problem considering the time constraints. This paper proposes a methodology for a joint dispatch of demand response and distributed generation to provide energy and reserve by a virtual power player that operates a distribution network. The optimal schedule minimizes the operation costs and it is obtained using a particle swarm optimization approach, which is compared with a deterministic approach used as reference methodology. The proposed method is applied to a 33-bus distribution network with 32 medium voltage consumers and 66 distributed generation units. © 2013 IEEE.","Demand response; distribution network; Network simulation; particle swarm optimization; virtual power player","Computational intelligence methods; Demand response; Distributed characteristics; Distributed Energy Resources; Distributed generation resources; Distributed generation units; Network simulation; Virtual power players; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Computer simulation; Distributed power generation; Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890055715

Basically in this method requirements are gathered from Artificial Intelligence (AI) expert system from various sources e.g., via interviews, scenarios or use cases. Then, these are converted into structured natural language using ontology and this new problem/case is put forward to Case Based Reasoning (CBR). CBR based on its previous information having similar requirements combines with new case and suggests a proposed solution. Based on this solution a prototype is developed and delivered to customer.

Their behavior is difficult to predict due to the complex and unexpected interleaving of different execution flows within the process. Therefore, serious flaws may go undetected and manifest themselves only after deployment. This problem may be tackled by applying formal methods to reason about business process models. In this paper we outline the main contributions in this application domain of (Armando et al. 2012), that uses the action-based planning language C and the Causal Calculator tool CCALC. C is used to specify a business process from the banking domain that is representative of an important class of business processes of practical relevance, and proved to be a rich and natural formal specification language in this domain. CCALC is then used to automatically solve three reasoning tasks that arise in this context. We also compare C with the SMV specification language used in model-checking: the comparison highlights some key advantages of C in the business process domain.

In the OR literature, this is called identical parallel machine scheduling, while in AI it is called number partitioning. For eight or more machines, an OR approach based on bin packing appears best, while for fewer machines, a collection of AI search algorithms perform best. We focus here on scheduling up to seven machines, and make several new contributions. One is a new method that significantly reduces duplicate partitions for all values of k, including k = 2. Another is a new version of the Complete-Karmarkar-Karp (CKK) algorithm that minimizes the makespan. A surprising negative result is that dynamic programming is not competitive for this problem, even for k = 2. We also explore the effect of precision of values on the choice of the best algorithm. Despite the simplicity of this problem, a number of different algorithms have been proposed, and the most efficient algorithm depends on the number of jobs, the number of machines, and the precision of the running times.

In order to share, search, and (partially) re-use context specific adaptations it is essential not only to store the adaptations, but also a business context model where these adaptations are valid. In this paper we describe the Unified Context Model (UCM) introduced by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). We explain the shortcomings of the approach and show how these can be undermined by our Enhanced Unified Context Model (E-UCM).

However, it appears that many indicators of our health insurance companies (including consultations, tests, hospitalizations, etc.) are well above the established international standards. This indicates that many appointments and tests are being carried out without need, generating unnecessary costs on businesses and making the service offered more expensive. In this paper, computational intelligence techniques were used to model the behavior of medical reviewers - professionals who assess whether medical requests should be allowed or not. For the generation of knowledge, a database from a nonprofitable health insurance company containing more than one million records collected since the year 2007 was used. Promising experimental results are presented, indicating that the techniques used can support medical reviewers. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computational intelligence techniques; Health care markets; Insurance companies; International standards; Medical claims; Artificial intelligence; Health insurance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889006956

For interoperability, the partial semantic interoperability between heterogeneous business models is challenging to achieve. Almost all of the enterprise business models can be described from the four major dimensions: Role, Goal, Process, Service (RGPS), consequently in this paper, a business model of service-based enterprise is actually a specific RGPS model, an approach for measuring the interoperability of RGPS models is proposed. At first, the RGPS interoperability features framework is constructed based on Meta-model Framework of Interoperability (MFI), and it is specified to be the interoperability features set of RGPS models, secondly, the interoperability features set and a mathematical method are proposed to identify and quantify a RGPS model and its interoperability features, then the model instance of the RGPS model is produced, next, we calculate the similarity between two model instances, and obtain the measuring results of interoperability between corresponding RGPS models, which is used to build the interoperability measurement matrix of RGPS models set. © 2013 IEEE.","Heterogeneous business models; Interoperability features; Interoperability measurement; MFI; Service-based enterprise","Business modeling; Business models; Mathematical method; Measurement matrix; MFI; Semantic interoperability; Service-based; Supporting tool; Artificial intelligence; Industry; Semantics; Interoperability",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900637190

Web services composition is widely used to business environment. With the features of inherent autonomy and heterogeneity for component Web services it is difficult to predict the behaviors of the overall composite service. Therefore, transactional properties and non-functional quality of service (QoS) properties are crucial for selecting the web services to take part in the composition. Transactional properties ensure reliability of composite Web service, and QoS properties can identify the best candidate web services from a set of functionally-equivalent services. In this paper we define a Colored Petri Net (CPN) model which involves transactional properties of Web services in the composition process. To ensure reliable and correct execution, unfolding processes of the CPN are followed.

We also develop a dynamic optimization approach to guide the setting of key auction parameters. Given the bounded rationality of human decision makers, we propose to augment auctioneers' capabilities with high performance decision support tools in the form of software agents.

MobiS intelligence is based on the symbiotic relation between these stakeholders, innovative prediction and reasoning methods that are using learned multi-criteria function to provide more efficient, energy-aware and environmental friendly citizen mobility. MobiS will be able to combine novel artificial intelligence services and traditional information platform services coming from the following sources: a) existing transport private or public service providers, b) ambient data, based on sensor infrastructures and c) social networking data. To achieve these challenging objectives, the project will develop prediction/planning/reasoning services, multi-criteria decision functions and, federated mobility-based services that correspond to the above mentioned information sources. Solutions will be tested in three pilots: 1) An inter-city mobility scenario in Sweden (Stockholm-Hudiksvall-Sundsvall), where an existing crowdsourcing application will be used, 2) an intra-city scenario in Greece (Thessaloniki) combining a traffic information system and the crowdsourcing application and, 3) a country-wide (inter-city) mobility scenario in Slovenia with a social media application, and selected traffic information system already operated in various parts of the country and in the main cities. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.","Artificial intelligence; Energy efficient mobility; Federated platform implementation; Multi-criteria decision; Reasoning services","Artificial intelligence methods; Artificial intelligence techniques; Energy efficient; European research project; Multicriteria decision; Platform implementations; Reasoning services; Traffic information systems; Energy efficiency; Information systems; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896839907

Also, we discuss the implementation of potential improvements to our previous work which aim to develop a semi-automated horizon scanning system. © Springer-Verlag 2013.",,"Business intelligence systems; Changing environment; Horizon scanning; Incipient trends; Intelligence gathering; Management goals; Systematic searches; Web-based information; Soft computing; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893759096

Cluster analysis is an important data mining technique used to find data segmentation and pattern recognition. This paper proposes the application of Fuzzy Subtractive Clustering (FSC) technique as an approach to define Big Five Patterns (B5P) using psychometric tests for students in engineering programs. In comparison with an ANFIS Learning Approach, FSC gives us a better and broader relationship of the behavioral pattern between B5 traits and careers. This will help students find a better way to choose a career and relate their personality with career planning or for job advice; and school counselors as a tool to guide their students in career counseling. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","Big five personality test; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy logic","Behavioral patterns; Career counseling; Data segmentation; Engineering program; Fuzzy subtractive clustering; Learning approach; Personality tests; Psychometric test; Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy logic; Pattern recognition; Soft computing; Students; Behavioral research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893752987

In numerous countries, especially the developed ones, the market is saturated to the extent that each new customer must be won over from the competitors. At the same time, public policies and standardization of mobile communication now allow customers to easily switch over from one carrier to another, resulting in a fluid market. Since the cost of winning a new customer is far greater than the cost of retaining an existing one, mobile carriers have now shifted their focus from customer acquisition to customer retention. As a result, churn prediction has emerged as the most crucial Business Intelligence (BI) application that aims at identifying customers who are about to transfer their business to a competitor i.e. to churn. This paper aims to present commonly used data mining techniques for the identification of customers who are about to churn. Based on historical data, these methods try to find patterns which can identify possible churners. Some of the well-known algorithms used during this research are Regression analysis, Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The data set used in this study was obtained from Customer DNA website. It contains traffic data of 106,000 customers and their usage behavior for 3 months. We also discuss the use of re-sampling method in order to solve the problem of class imbalance. Our results show that in case of the data set used, decision trees is the most accurate classifier algorithm while identifying potential churners. © 2013 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Churn prediction; Data Mining","Churn predictions; Classifier algorithms; Customer acquisition; Customer retention; Historical data; Mobile carriers; Mobile communications; Resampling method; Algorithms; Commerce; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Decision trees; Forestry; Information management; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Sales; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Commerce; Data Processing; Information Retrieval; Neural Networks; Regression Analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893595295

It is used for decades in different fields like climate, crime, health, business... Although the purpose of different forecasting systems is not the same, in general, they help decision-makers to make appropriate plans for future likely events. As the nature of forecasting methods and measures are often quantitative, these predictive analytics systems usually use a data warehouse to store data and OLAP tools to visualize query/simulation results. A specific feature of forecasting systems regarding predictions analysis is backward propagation of updates, which is the computation of the impact, on raw data, of modifications performed on summaries. In data warehouses, some methods propagate updates over hierarchies when modifications are performed on data sources. However, so far, very few works have been devoted to update propagation from summaries to raw data. This paper proposes an algorithm called PAM (Propagation of Aggregate-based Modification), to efficiently propagate modifications performed on summaries to raw data, and then to other summaries. Experiments have been conducted on an operational application. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Decision support systems; Forecasting applications; Materialized views; OLAP; Update propagation","Backward propagation; Decision makers; Forecasting methods; Forecasting system; Materialized view; OLAP; Operational applications; Predictive analytics; Artificial intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Data flow analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893371127

Emergency operations personnel at chemical weapons stockpile sites within the continental United States know exactly what to do. They rely on WebPuff, a state-of-the-art decision support system sponsored by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Activity (CMA)1 and developed by IEM, a security consulting firm based in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park. WebPuff is used by military and civilian jurisdictions within the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), which is jointly managed by the U.S. Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). WebPuff provides users at CSEPP sites with a suite of planning and response tools that are integrated with a unique chemical dispersion model that provides an advanced level of science on which decisions about public protection can be based. Incorporating real-time and forecast weather, topography data, and current toxicity standards, WebPuff's dispersion model provides the most realistic plume prediction in less than two minutes - enabling military installations to meet a five-minute criterion for notifying civilian jurisdictions of an impending threat. WebPuff's chemical dispersion model has been independently tested and certified by scientists at Dugway Proving Ground [1, 2]. WebPuff incorporates a shared framework for risk management among independently managed military and civil jurisdictions at each site as well as a common understanding of how to plan for and, if necessary, respond to the threat that faces communities around chemical weapons stockpile sites every day. In developing the system, CMA and IEM gained consensus from both military and civilian users on operational requirements, business rules, and detailed designs for reports and computer displays that are foundational to the system. WebPuff provides users with information that is organized - primarily through visual means - around a common understanding of the threat and a common concept of operations. Moreover, it is a cost-effective solution to emergency preparedness and response because it is built using 100% open-source technology - the customer pays no third-party license fees. The system meets Department of Defense security and interoperability requirements - military bases using the system can communicate securely and effectively with civilian emergency management organizations. As a result, WebPuff is Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) certified with a current Authority to Operate (ATO) on Army networks. To ensure interoperability with civilian jurisdictions, the system uses the Emergency Data eXchange Language (EDXL) Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). Nearly ten years after its fielding, WebPuff continues to evolve to meet emerging standards and operational concepts and CSEPP communities are still using the system. Its ability to provide trusted results quickly and to truly facilitate cooperation and collaboration among diverse organizations during disaster response has been, and continues to be, the key to its success. While WebPuff was originally designed to support preparedness for chemical weapons accidents, it represents a unique framework, models, and components that can be customized and extended for use with other hazards and other concepts of operations. © 2013 IEEE.","data visualizaiton; decision making; information management; information sharing; integrated decision support; preparedness; risk assessment; Situaitonal awareness; situational underdtanding","data visualizaiton; Information sharing; Integrated decision; preparedness; Situaitonal awareness; situational underdtanding; Accidents; Accreditation; Artificial intelligence; Chemical warfare; Civil defense; Decision making; Decision support systems; Disasters; Dispersions; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Management science; Military bases; National security; Risk assessment; Risk management; Security systems; Weather forecasting; Interoperability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893226359

A major consequence of this trend is the manipulation and generation of a huge amount of data in simulations, which require to be efficiently managed. In this paper, we present a Combination Framework of Business intelligence solution and Multi-agent platform (CFBM) and its implementation on the GAMA platform. CFBM is a logical framework dedicated to the management of the input and output data of simulations, as well as the corresponding empirical datasets in an integrated way and the analysis on integrated data, which we propose as a coupling of two major methodologies: Multi-Agent Simulation (MAS) on one hand and Business Intelligence (BI) solution on the other. An integrated model of a surveillance network and Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) invasion is presented. This model is used throughout the paper as a case study of CFBM regarding to the database accesses, the integration of internal and external processing, and the model validation tasks. We show how the proposed combination framework can be an appropriate choice for all decision-support systems with a huge data, hence the modelers can be also encouraged to develop the big model in a large scale.

The emergence of Cloud computing has enabled the deployment of such tasks onto resources sourced on-demand from Cloud providers. This has enabled so-called elastic processes that are able to dynamically adjust their resource usage to meet varying workloads. Traditional Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs) do not consider the needs of elastic processes such as monitoring facilities, tracking the current and future system landscape, reasoning about optimally utilizing resources given Quality of Service constraints, and executing necessary actions (e.g., start/stop servers, move services).

Consistency on data, which is defined as satisfaction of a set of data integrity constraints, is one of the basic properties for business process transactions (BPTs). This requires a BPT to bring the BP execution from one consistent state to another consistent state. It is desirable to ensure within BP executions that every BPT preserves data consistency. Besides, the earlier an inconsistency is detected the less recovery is necessary. It is studied in this paper how to detect and recover from potential future inconsistency as early as possible in a BPT execution.

Users might be instinctively reluctant to exposure their preferences in their own published messages for the privacy protection issues. However, their preferences can never be concealed in those information they read (or subscribed), since users do need to get something useful in their readings, especially in the microblog application.

One of the challenging areas in cloud computing is frequent optimization of cloud server. It mainly concerns with the load balancing of cloud data centers to improve efficiency of the host machine and minimize number of active host machine to support green computing concept. To balance the load of entire data center, we need to transfer the virtual machines of the overloaded host to the light weighted host using migration techniques. In this paper, we introduce a threshold based Dynamic compare and balance algorithm (DCABA) for cloud server optimization. Unlike the traditional server optimization strategies which consider only load balancing and scheduling of resources based on the usage of CPU, RAM and BW in physical servers, DCABA also minimizes the number of host machines to be powered on, for reducing the cost of cloud services. Our approach can serve the purpose of service cost reduction in cloud industry with effective utilization of available resources. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud Computing; Dynamic Resource Managememt; Green Computing; Load Balancing; Server Consolidation","Cloud data centers; Cloud service providers; Computing resource; Dynamic resources; Green computing; Migration technique; Optimization strategy; Server consolidation; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Cost reduction; Distributed database systems; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Resource allocation; Information technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892647864

A dedicated team is assigned to address all (and only those) requirements that are specific to the customer. However, this way of organizing service delivery leads to inefficiencies due to inability to use expertise and available resources across teams in a flexible manner. To address some of these challenges, in recent times, there has been interest in shared delivery of services, where instead of having customer specific teams working in silos, there are cross-customer teams (shared resource pools) that can potentially service more than one customer. However, this gives rise to the question of what is the best way of grouping the shared resources across customer? Especially, with the large variations in the technical and domain skills required to address customer requirements, what should be the service delivery model for diverse customer workloads? Should it be customer-focused? Business domain focused? Or Technology focused? This paper simulates different delivery models in face of complex customer workload, diverse customer profiles, stringent service contracts, and evolving skills, with the goal of scientifically deriving principles of decision making for a suitable delivery model. Results show that workload arrival pattern, customer work profile combinations and domain skills, all play a significant role in the choice of delivery model. Specifically, the complementary nature of work arrivals and degree of overlapping skill requirements among customers play a crucial role in the choice of models. Interestingly, the impact of skill expertise level of resources is overshadowed by these two factors. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Arrival patterns; Business domain; Customer profiles; Customer requirements; Service contract; Service delivery; Shared resources; Skill requirements; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892405250

These are key conceptual entities that are central to guiding the operations of a business, and whose content changes as they move through those operations. A business artifact type is modeled using (a) an information model, which is intended to hold all business-relevant data about entities of this type, and (b) a lifecycle model, which is intended to hold the possible ways that an entity of this type might progress through the business. In 2010 a declarative style of business artifact lifecycles, called Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM), was introduced [4, 5]. GSM has since been adopted [7] to form the conceptual basis of the OMG Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) standard [1].

Researchers derive the actual business process from event logs to draw a comparison with the business process model. When the two are inconsistent, a lack of internal controls happens. This research proposes the consistence checking in the event logs. Because of the different granularity in the same event logs, the process can be demonstrated as grain 1 to grain n, in which the smaller the grain means the finer the granularity of the process. While using a process log to retrace the business process, different business processes might be shown in the processes with different granularities in the same event logs. The dependency threshold of Heuristic miner algorithm is used to deal with the differences of consistency automatically in this research. This research uses the event logs from a marble processing industry for the case conformance. Focusing on the fine and coarse two granularities of the business process matrix, the conformance checking is applied for a consistent business process via the setting of the dependency threshold and the consistent ratio.

Furthermore, according to the conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) of Lakoff and Johnson (Metaphors we live by. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1980), metaphor also plays an important structural role in the organization and processing of conceptual knowledge. According to this account, the phenomenon of metaphor is not restricted to similarity-based extensions of meanings of individual words, but instead involves activating fixed mappings that reconceptualize one whole area of experience in terms of another. CMT produced a significant resonance in the fields of philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence and still underlies a large proportion of modern research on metaphor. However, there has to date been no comprehensive corpus-based study of conceptual metaphor, which would provide an empirical basis for evaluating the CMT using real-world linguistic data. The annotation scheme and the empirical study we present in this paper is a step towards filling this gap. We test our annotation procedure in an experimental setting involving multiple annotators and estimate their agreement on the task. The goal of the study is to investigate (1) how intuitive the conceptual metaphor explanation of linguistic metaphors is for human annotators and whether it is possible to consistently annotate interconceptual mappings; (2) what are the main difficulties that the annotators experience during the annotation process; (3) whether one conceptual metaphor is sufficient to explain a linguistic metaphor or whether a chain of conceptual metaphors is needed. The resulting corpus annotated for conceptual mappings provides a new, valuable dataset for linguistic, computational and cognitive experiments on metaphor. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conceptual metaphor theory; Corpus annotation; Human experimentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890547913

For a new SAT instance to be solved, our portfolio finds its k-nearest neighbors from the training set and invokes a solver that performs the best for those instances.

This paper formulates WSD as a variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) to maximize the overall semantic relatedness of the context to be disambiguated. Ant colony optimization, a robust nature-inspired algorithm, was used in a reinforcement learning manner to solve the formulated TSP. We propose a novel measure based on the Lesk algorithm and Vector Space Model to calculate semantic relatedness. Our approach to WSD is comparable to state-of-the-art knowledge-based and unsupervised methods for benchmark datasets. In addition, we show that the combination of knowledge-based methods is superior to the most frequent sense heuristic and significantly reduces the difference between knowledge-based and supervised methods.

The main advantage of the model lies that it can be built only by the data under normal cutting condition. Therefore, the training samples of the tool wear status are no longer needed during the training process that makes it easier to be applied in real industrial environment than other neural network models. An averaged distance indicator is proposed to denote not only the occurrence of the tool wear but also its severity. Moreover, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm is introduced to improve the convergence accuracy of the auto associative neural network. Based on the proposed method, a framework for online tool condition monitoring is illustrated and the cutting force data under different tool wear status are collected to simulate the online modeling and monitoring process for the rough and finish milling respectively. The results show that the proposed indicator can reflect the evolution process of tool wear correctly and the LM algorithm is more accurate in comparison with the gradient descent methods. Therefore, it casts new light on practical application of neural network in the field of on line tool condition monitoring. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial intelligence; Auto associative neural network; Monitoring; Tool wear","Autoassociative neural networks; Gradient Descent method; Industrial environments; Levenberg-Marquardt; Neural network model; Tool wear; Tool wear monitoring; Training algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Damage detection; Monitoring; Neural networks; Wear of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888642906

The systems fulfilling this architecture will be able to store electronic health records of the patients using OWL ontologies, share patient records among different hospitals and provide physicians expertise to assist them in making decisions. The system is intelligent because it is rule-based, makes use of rule-based reasoning and has the ability to learn and evolve itself. The learning capability is provided by extracting rules from previously given decisions by the physicians and then adding the extracted rules to the system. The proposed system is novel and original in all of these aspects. As a case study, a system is implemented conforming to SAMS architecture for use by dentists in the dental domain. The use of the developed system is described with a scenario. For evaluation, the developed dental information system will be used and tried by a group of dentists. The development of this system proves the applicability of SAMS architecture. By getting decision support from a system derived from this architecture, the cognitive gap between experienced and inexperienced physicians can be compensated. Thus, patient satisfaction can be achieved, inexperienced physicians are supported in decision making and the personnel can improve their knowledge. A physician can diagnose a case, which he/she has never diagnosed before, using this system. With the help of this system, it will be possible to store general domain knowledge in this system and the personnel's need to medical guideline documents will be reduced. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Decision support system; Electronic health record; Health information system; Multi-agent system; Ontology; Reasoning","architecture; article; decision making; decision support system; electronic medical record; human; information processing; intelligence quotient; knowledge discovery; learning algorithm; medical information system; medical ontology; patient satisfaction; practice guideline; artificial intelligence; information system; medical information system; organization and management; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Information Systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886834725

Methods Population-based historical cohort design. Data were extracted from a Canadian provincial workers' compensation database on all claimants undergoing work assessment between December 2009 and January 2011. Data were available on: (1) numerous personal, clinical, occupational, and social variables; (2) type of rehabilitation undertaken; and (3) outcomes following rehabilitation (receiving time loss benefits or undergoing repeat programs). Machine learning, concerned with the design of algorithms to discriminate between classes based on empirical data, was the foundation of our approach to build a classification system with multiple independent and dependent variables. Results The population included 8,611 unique claimants. Subjects were predominantly employed (85 %) males (64 %) with diagnoses of sprain/strain (44 %). Baseline clinician classification accuracy was high (ROC = 0.86) for selecting programs that lead to successful return-to-work. Classification performance for machine learning techniques outperformed the clinician baseline classification (ROC = 0.94). The final classifiers were multifactorial and included the variables: injury duration, occupation, job attachment status, work status, modified work availability, pain intensity rating, self-rated occupational disability, and 9 items from the SF-36 Health Survey. Conclusions The use of machine learning classification techniques appears to have resulted in classification performance better than clinician decision-making. The final algorithm has been integrated into a computer-based clinical decision support tool that requires additional validation in a clinical sample. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification; Compensation and redress; Machine learning; Musculoskeletal diseases; Prediction; Rehabilitation","adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; Canada; classification; computer program; decision support system; female; human; male; methodology; middle aged; musculoskeletal disease; occupational accident; return to work; Adult; Alberta; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Injuries; Return to Work; Software Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886095059

It was introduced in 2005 using continuous optimization problems as an example application. Similar to what has happened with other swarm intelligence techniques, after the initial proposal, several researchers have studied variants of the original algorithm. Unfortunately, often these variants have been tested under different experimental conditions and different fine-tuning efforts for the algorithm parameters. In this article, we review various variants of the original ABC algorithm and experimentally study nine ABC algorithms under two settings: either using the original parameter settings as proposed by the authors, or using an automatic algorithm configuration tool using a same tuning effort for each algorithm. We also study the effect of adding local search to the ABC algorithms. Our experimental results show that local search can improve considerably the performance of several ABC variants and that it reduces strongly the performance differences between the studied ABC variants. We also show that the best ABC variants are competitive with recent state-of-the-art algorithms on the benchmark set we used, which establishes ABC algorithms as serious competitors in continuous optimization. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial bee colony; Automatic algorithm configuration; Continuous optimization; Experimental study","Artificial bee colonies; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Automatic algorithms; Continuous optimization; Continuous optimization problems; Experimental study; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Swarm intelligence techniques; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Optimization; Parameter estimation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885908675

That is, they are increasingly part of collaborations with other enterprises, with such collaborations being fulfilled by the exchange of business services among the participants. To that end, there is now a felt need for developing formal models of such collaborations, by leveraging past work on Enterprise Architecture (EA) models. In this paper, we present an architectural framework for modeling such collaborations as virtual enterprises (VEs), since these collaborations involve interactions among multiple enterprises. Our framework is modeled by treating the VE as an enterprise itself, but with special characteristics that distinguish it from regular enterprises, viz., nature of collaborations among the participating enterprises, extent of their participation, and conflicts among the participants. The latter characteristic arises due to the autonomy of the participants and the dynamic nature of inter-organizational business interactions, and is especially crucial for VE modeling. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our architectural framework with a realistic running example. We also present and discuss some future challenges regarding modeling dynamic behavior in the VE, in particular, conflict modeling & resolution among the participating enterprises. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","Architectural framework; Enterprise architecture; Service-oriented enterprise; Virtual enterprises","Architectural frameworks; Business enterprise; Business interactions; Conflict modeling; Enterprise Architecture; Inter-organizational; Service-oriented enterprise; Virtual enterprise; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Virtual corporation",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883647360

Cyber credit-card fraud or no card present fraud is increasingly rampant in the recent years for the reason that the credit-card i s majorly used to request payments by these companies on the internet. Therefore the need to ensure secured transactions for credit-card owners when consuming their credit cards to make electronic payments for goods and services provided on the internet is a criterion. Data mining has popularly gained recognition in combating cyber credit-card fraud because of its effective artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and algorithms that can be implemented to detect or predict fraud through Knowledge Discovery from unusual patterns derived from gathered data. In this study, a system's model for cyber credit card fraud detection is discussed and designed. This system implements the supervised anomaly detection algorithm of Data mining to detect fraud in a real time transaction on the internet, and thereby classifying the transaction as legitimate, suspicious fraud and illegitimate transaction. The anomaly detection algorithm is designed on the Neural Networks which implements the working principal of the human brain (as we humans learns from past experience and then make our present day decisions on what we have learned from our past experience).

This scoring process uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and is verified by analysing 552 rugby matches over three seasons of the Celtic League and European Rugby Cup. We examine if the attributes of performance follow an underlying structure.

Taking a multi-agent system modeling approach, this paper presents a conceptual platform for discovering dynamic pricing solutions that reflect the varying cost of electricity in the wholesale market as well as the level of demand participation, especially regarding household customers and small and medium sized businesses. At first, an agent-based meta-model representing various concepts, relations, and structure of agents is constructed. Then a domain model can be instantiated based upon the meta-model. Finally, a simulation experiment is developed for use case demonstration and model validation. The simulation is for the supplier to obtain the profit-maximizing demand curve which has such a shape that it follows the spot price curve in inverse ratio. The result suggests that this multi-agent-based construct could contribute to 1) estimating the impacts of various timevarying tariff options on peak-period energy use through simulation, before any experimental pilots can be carried out; 2) modeling the electricity retail market evolving interactions in a systematic manner; 3) inducing innovative simulation configurations.","Agent-based modeling; Computational intelligence; Demand response; Electricity markets; Meta-model; Multi-agent systems; Real-time pricing; Smart grids","Agent-based model; Demand response; Electricity market; Meta model; Real time pricing; Smart grid; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Information systems; Mathematical models; Multi agent systems; Smart power grids; Computer simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887787431

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for an even longer period of time studied rule-based production systems, which at a closer look appear to be relevant for RV, although seemingly focused on slightly different application domains, such as for example business processes and expert systems. The core algorithm in many of these systems is the Rete algorithm. We have implemented a Rete-based runtime verification system, named LogFire (originally intended for offline log analysis but also applicable to online analysis), as an internal DSL in the Scala programming language, using Scala's support for defining DSLs.

These criteria are focused on system efficiency and cost, which is reasonable in the context of generous financial support schemes. However, when financial support is phased out, the PV market becomes technologically diversified. Environmental concerns and other qualitative issues become significant, whereas efficiency and costs may fail to describe PV systems properly. This study presents the first application of outranking techniques for PV technologies within an overall framework that includes qualitative, economic, technical and environmental criteria. The multi-criteria analysis method, ELECTRE III, identifies optimal investment decisions from a pre-determined set of investment alternatives. A case study based on a grid-connected household PV system in the United Kingdom illustrates the methodology. The results suggest emerging excitronic PV technologies such as organic PV to lead the ranking when compared with inorganic technologies. These results have to be taken in the context of a number of assumptions and estimates as well as free market, no financial support schemes and promising future technology developments.

They are responsible for collecting, transforming and consolidating massive volumes of data from a diverse set of Network Elements (NE) across a range of protocols. Traditionally, mediation systems support revenue management functions such as charging and billing. Unlike standard data warehousing applications that are based on Extract-Transform-Lead (ETL) paradigm, mediation systems are focused on rapid processing of events in real-time or near real-time. This paper proposes the use of mediation system as a data management platform for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. Mediation systems inherently deliver scalable solutions for handling huge volumes of sensor data. They can connect across a diverse set of M2M communication protocols to collect, consolidate, process sensor data and feed it downstream to decision support systems for actionable intelligence.

Because of the high risk that arises when business decisions are based on faulty spreadsheets, in recent years new approaches for spreadsheet quality assurance have been proposed. Among them are techniques that allow for more intelligent tool support during the spreadsheet test and debugging process. The design and evaluation of such new methods and tools, which are for example based on model-based techniques is however challenging. On the one hand, real-world spreadsheets can be large and complex, thus requiring highly efficient and scalable error-location algorithms. On the other hand, as spreadsheets are usually developed by non-programmers, special care has to be taken when designing the debugging user interface. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and present the design and architecture of an integrated framework for spreadsheet debugging called EXQUISITE. Furthermore, we report details and first experimental results of a constraint-based debugging approach implemented in the framework, which supports the automated identification of possible spreadsheet errors based on user-provided test cases and model-based diagnosis techniques.

Increasing diffusion and convergence of ICT, bio- And nanotechnologies, movements favoring «green» technologies and business models and holistic health, among others, are typically viewed as drivers of the new wave. The majority of futurists tend to look favorably upon these supposed trends, ways of resolving major challenges facing mankind. Others, including the author of this paper, argue that there are risks related to the development of new technologies, as well as factors of natural and social origin, which may impede the implementation of rosy scenarios. Implied is a reference to so-called «extreme events» (X-events) - hardly predictable, often unexpected short-term phenomena, whose intervention reverses the current trend in an opposite direction and may cause huge destructive effects. Their occurrence is pre-determined by a set of matured contextual prerequisites (primarily the complexity gap between governing system and addressed challenges, as well as changing social mood) and the random factor playing a role of a catalyst. Using the complexity theory, the author evaluates the ability of a number of extreme factors to disrupt the abovementioned megatrends driving the sixth Kondratieff wave. Events and processes, such as global climate change, epidemics, famine, collapse of the Internet, and enslavement of human artificial intelligence, may produce scenarios that are totally different from those projected by most experts. However, as shown in the paper, the ability to predict and diligently consider the possible X-events followed by adoption of appropriate measures may allow the prevention or at least diminution of the devastating impact of such events.","Changing context; Complexity gap; Critical point; Kondratieff cycles; Sixth kondratieff wave; Social mood; Trend; Trigger; X-event",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887108469

A key challenge in DCP systems is how to coordinate activities for a group of planning agents. This problem is compounded when these agents are situated in a real-world dynamic domain where the agents often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. To date, DCP systems have only focused on cases where agents' behavior is designed to optimize a global plan. In contrast, this paper presents a temporal reasoning mechanism for self-interested planning agents. To do so, we model agents' behavior based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) theoretical model of cooperation, while modeling dynamic joint plans with group time constraints through creating hierarchical abstraction plans integrated with temporal constraints network. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) the BDI model specifies a behavior for self interested agents working in a group, permitting an individual agent to schedule its activities in an autonomous fashion, while taking into consideration temporal constraints of its group members; (ii) abstract plans allow the group to plan a joint action without explicitly describing all possible states in advance, making it possible to reduce the number of states which need to be considered in a BDI-based approach; and (iii) a temporal constraints network enables each agent to reason by itself about the best time for scheduling activities, making it possible to reduce coordination messages among a group. The mechanism ensures temporal consistency of a cooperative plan, enables the interleaving of planning and execution at both individual and group levels. We report on how the mechanism was implemented within a commercial training and simulation application, and present empirical evidence of its effectiveness in real-life scenarios and in reducing communication to coordinate group members' activities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial intelligence; Cooperation; Coordination; Multiagent system; Planning; Time constraints",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894843900

In order to improve the data processing efficiency and minimize the negative influence such as human error in the conventional methods, a rapid, automatic and accurate method for the surface structure analysis and the fabric weave pattern recognition is proposed. First of all, an imaging system was designed to obtain the double-faced images of fabric samples, and then the captured images were treated by projection algorithm in both warp and weft directions to generate a grid net which splits the image into massive nodes. In the following step, the nodes were preliminary classified based on the intensity of the node's quadrilateral boundary and at the same time, the color of the nodes was calculated by using the color clustering method. To improve the accuracy of node classification, the types and color information of the adjacent nodes, together with double-faced image information, were utilized for error correction. At last, the node information acquired was encoded and expressed digitally by a basic matrix, two one-dimension matrices (row and column) and a color mapping table. Following the procedure above, the digital model of the weave pattern of the sample fabric is established. Experiments have been conducted and show the performance of the proposed method. © 2013 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Classification of the node; Digital matrix; Double-faced imaging system; Intelligent recognition; Redundant information","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Color; Error correction; Image enhancement; Imaging systems; Pattern recognition; Surface structure; Color information; Conventional methods; Image information; Intelligent recognition; Projection algorithms; Redundant information; Surface structure analysis; Textile production; Weaving",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890416032

The approximation is the best if the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true joint probability distribution and the approximating one is minimal. Finding the best approximating k-1-width junction tree probability distribution is NP-complete if 2<k<d-1, where d is the dimension of the joint probability distribution (see Karger and Srebro in 12th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), 2001, Malvestuto in Kybernetika 48:825-844, 2012). In Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (BRAIN), special issue on complexity in sciences and artificial intelligence, pp. 40-45, 2010 we also proved that the best approximating k-1-width junction tree probability distribution can be embedded into a k-th order cherry tree probability distribution.We introduce here a greedy algorithm resulting very good approximations in reasonable computing time. We prove then that if the Markov network which encodes the conditional independences of the multivariate probability distribution fulfills some requirements then our greedy algorithm is able to find the true probability distribution. Our algorithm uses just the k-th order marginal probability distributions as input.We compare the results of the greedy algorithm proposed in this paper with the greedy algorithm proposed by Malvestuto (IEEE Trans.

Consequently, they have to undergo a stringent regulatory compliance procedure in conformity with an ever increasingly fierce and competitive business environment. Throughout the product life cycle, medical devices would significantly consume renewable as well as non-renewable resources and as a result exert a substantial social, economic and environmental impact(s). Sustainability from an overall perspective in terms of social, economic and environmental domains is crucial for decision-making during product development; nevertheless they have rarely been incorporated simultaneously. Both public and private institutions only focused towards economic and environmental sustainability without acknowledging the critical role of social sustainability that needs to be addressed concurrently so as to uphold the other two. Accordingly, it is imperative to consider the criteria of the aforementioned domains of sustainability in the initial phases of product development. The proposed conceptual multifaceted framework comprehensively explores a broader scope of sustainable product development, mainly from the pragmatic standpoint of systems engineering in comparison to the contemporary evaluation and development approaches. The underpinnings of the proposed framework encompassthe critical role of a MultiCriteria Hierarchical Model (MCHM), which is in fact an extensive revision of the analytical hierarchy process decision making model. The MCHM mainly functions across the idea screening phase (Stage 2) up to the business and feasibility analysis phase (Stage 4). Moreover, unlike its predecessors, the MultiCriteria Hierarchical Model is less dependent upon numerical scores allotted by expert opinion and apparently broader in its scope of application. Furthermore, the proposed framework elucidates the active participation of the MCHM in product design and development by conjoining with an artificial intelligence based computer system known as expert systems. The principal objective of the proposed conceptual framework is to deliver a thorough assessment and a feasible roadmap for the development of sustainable medical devices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Analytical hierarchy process; Design optimization; MultiCriteria Hierarchical Model; Product development; Sustainability","Analytical Hierarchy Process; Design optimization; Environmental sustainability; Hierarchical model; Medical device development; Non-renewable resource; Product design and development; Sustainable product development; Artificial intelligence; Biomedical equipment; Decision making; Environmental impact; Expert systems; Hierarchical systems; Optimization; Product development; Regulatory compliance; Sustainable development; analytical hierarchy process; commercialization; competitiveness; decision making; design; medicine; multicriteria analysis; numerical model; optimization; product development; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887626114

They are capable of authoring original messages, and can even simulate illocutionary force and speaker meaning. Background intelligence embedded in their datasets enhances these speech capacities. Although there is an open question about who is ultimately responsible for their speech, if anybody, we can settle this question by using the notion of proxy speech, in which responsibility for artificial speech acts is assigned legally or conventionally to an entity separate from the speech actant. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial speech; Machine intelligence; Natural language generation; Philosophy of computational linguistics; Speech acts","Machine intelligence; Natural language generation; Speech acts; Williams; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Speech",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887429244

The algorithm mimics the dynamics of river system and the behavior of water drops in the rivers. For this purpose data from Dez reservoir, located in southwestern Iran, has been used to examine the performance of the model. Moreover, due to similarities between IWD and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms, the results are compared with those of the ACO algorithm. Comparison of the results shows that while the IWD algorithm finds relatively better solutions, it is able to overcome the computational time consumption deficiencies inherited in the ACO methods.

Marketing decision makers constantly need to monitor changes in the environment and organization to make necessary changes. Therefore, a knowledge management (KM) system is required to acquire, store, retrieve and use up-to-date knowledge. Corporations also tend to look for systems to assist them in knowledge management. Agent technology looks set for assisting organizations in collecting, processing and using knowledge with high accuracy, speed and efficiency. This paper proposes a knowledge management framework for marketing decision making through using agent technology, fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy AHP is used for allocating the weight of determinant criteria and fuzzy logic is deployed for determining the final decision in pessimistic, moderate and optimistic satiations. The objectives of this study are as follows: (a) developing a knowledge management framework for capturing, storing, disseminating and utilizing marketing knowledge by using agent system, and (b) helping marketing decision makers to make effective decisions based on useful knowledge, and (c) encouraging marketing decisions towards the intelligence. Implementation of the proposed system in a car factory indicates that it is efficient and effective in supporting and improving marketing decision making. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The recent advances regarding Internet of Things, social computing, and mobile access technologies converge to make pervasive computing truly ubiquitous. The key challenge is to make simple and robust solutions for normal users, which shifts the focus from complex platforms involving machine learning and artificial intelligence to more hands on construction of services that are tailored or personalized for individual users. This chapter discusses Internet of Things together with Social Computing as a basis for components that users in a ""digital city"" could utilize to make their daily life better, safer, etc. A novel environment for user-created services, such as social apps, is presented as a possible solution for this. The vision is that anyone could make a simple service based on Internetenabled devices (Internet of Things) and encapsulated digital resources such as Open Data, which also can have social aspects embedded. This chapter also aims to identify trends, challenges, and recommendations in regard of Social Interaction for Digital Cities. This work will help expose future themes with high innovation and business potential based on a timeframe roughly 15 years ahead of now.

Retailers need to assign limited store space to a growing number of product categories such that sales and other performance metrics are maximized. Although this seems to be an ideal task for a data mining approach, there is one important barrier: the representativeness of the available data. In fact, changes to the layout of retail stores are infrequent. This means that very few values of the space variable are represented in the data, which makes it hard to generalize. In this paper, we describe a Decision Support System to assist retailers in this task. The system uses an Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize space allocation based on the estimated impact on sales caused by changes in the space assigned to product categories. We assess the quality of the system on a real case study, using different regression algorithms to generate the estimates. The system obtained very good results when compared with the recommendations made by the business experts. We also investigated the effect of the representativeness of the sample on the accuracy of the regression models. We selected a few product categories based on a heuristic assessment of their representativeness. The results indicate that the best regression models were obtained on products for which the sample was not the best. The reason for this unexpected results remains to be explained. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Evolutionary Algorithms; Regression; Representativeness of Sample; Retail","Performance metrics; Product categories; Regression; Regression algorithms; Regression model; Retail; Retail industry; Space allocation; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Retail stores; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886490871

At the same time with the increase in globalization, online collaborative tools have become very important in order to allow different businesses to communicate with each other, or even different parts of the same company to communicate more easily and share data. Previous work introduced an architecture for a geographically distributed, cloud based collaboration application. While the architecture allowed the scaling up and down of the number of cloud instances being used to host media servers, no control scheme for such cloud scaling was provided.

Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control method that has been widely used in Internet, operation system and relation database many years. Though RBAC is already relatively mature in the above fields, new problems occur when it is used in XML properties. By means of enterprise office automation system (EOA), the enterprise can easily migrate the release of information and communication functions to the Internet, which makes people convenience. The EOA system also provided a combination of enterprise management process reengineering, construction and optimization of the internal management information systems, decision support systems, and office automation systems. The system can get high level technical and advisory support for the management of enterprise information to fulfill the needs of specific business, affairs, and the conferences. This paper introduces EOA system strategy based on role-based access control (RBAC). The system centers in day-to-day office management service, achieves division of authority between different departments and staff through the introduction of data rights and function rights, so as to achieve the office management platform with the coordination of information, management, and service. This paper provides the method of realizing the work flow through RBAC management, the concept of authority is broken down to each operating procedures; realization of user operational procedures are reflected in the achievement of right-matching and right-series, office processes are standardized, the management level and quality are improved; the goal of improving office efficiency is achieved. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Computer network; Enterprise; Office automation automation; Rights flow; Role; Work flow","Enterprise management; Information and communication; Management platforms; Operational procedures; Rights flow; Role; Role-based Access Control; Work-flows; Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Computer networks; Decision support systems; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial electronics; Industry; Information technology; Internet; Mechanical engineering; Office automation; Office buildings; Reengineering; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886403201

The market competition and products upgrading are so vigorous that business success requires the data analysis to be carried out in real-time, or at least, as fast as possible. The real time analysis can help make decisions in time, and that actions in response to the analysis results must also be performed fast enough to meet the rapid changes in the demands from customers and regulators. The ACP (Artificial systems/societies, Computational experiments and Parallel execution) approach has provided us an opportunity to use various methods in modeling and analyzing a complex system in real time. We can build up artificial systems to reflect how the actual systems could be running. Computational experiments are performed to analyze different scenarios or different configurations of the system. The parallel execution provides a mechanism for using the results from the experiments on the artificial systems to guide the real system. In this paper, we present our approach of applying ACP to establishing a real-time business intelligence system. Compared with traditional business intelligence systems, the ACP approach provides a variety of possible results by scientific calculations in advance, which can help make real time or at least fast enough decisions. © 2013 IEEE.","ACP Approach; Business Intelligence; Real-Time System","ACP approaches; Business intelligence systems; Competitive environment; Computational experiment; Enterprise performance; Parallel executions; Real time analysis; Scientific calculations; Commerce; Competition; Competitive intelligence; Experiments; Information science; Real time systems; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886399289

The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This first interview was with Dr William Townsend, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Barrett Technology. Before founding Barrett, he created the world's first haptic manipulator, dubbed Whole-Arm Manipulator (WAMe) and designed to be user-centric, during his PhD 1988 completed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He completed his PhD minor at Harvard Business School and Sloan School of Management on Managing Technical Innovation. He has won more than a dozen awards, including the Joseph F. Engelberger Award, for his technical leadership in robotics and has authored many papers and patents on the foundational technologies of robotics. Findings - Initially perceived in 1985 as controversial, PhD candidate William Townsend convinces the MIT thesis committee that his groundbreaking concept of a safer robot with back drivable cables would lead to new markets of human/robot interaction. Three patents resulted from this PhD effort, as well as the start-up company, Barrett Technology, to develop and sell the company's flagship robot product, the WAM. One of the first uses of this cabledriven arm technology was effectively deployed in surgical robots. Other innovations were developed over several decades and to date Barrett Technology has cumulative sales of about $40 million with an accelerating pace and net profitability. Originality/value - In a unique situation at the time, a robot PhD inventor turns his originations into a profitable business that catapults new applications and markets in the robotic industry. The details, challenges, and successes of his 25-year experiences are highlighted as a valuable contribution for other engineers contemplating a robot start-up. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Co-operating; Grippers; Health and safety; Man/machine interface; Operating room","Chief executive officer; Co-operating; Design/methodology/approach; Harvard Business School; Health and safety; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Technical innovation; Technological inventions; Artificial intelligence; Cables; Commerce; Grippers; Manipulators; Operating rooms; Profitability; Robotics; Robots; Technology; Patents and inventions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886045534

They are critical to deriving a balanced portfolio of stocks and, more broadly, to risk management. Businesses, academics and government agencies have all researched and developed various schemes with mixed success. Recognizing major brokerages and research firms tend to assign their analysts to cover highly similar companies, we propose a scheme that makes use of stock analyst coverage assignments. Although creating coverage groups of highly similar stocks is not the direct goal of research firms, it may be imperative to their success because increasing similarity in coverage helps maximize synergy and derive the most value per analyst. To create our industry scheme, we construct a hypergraph where vertices represent stocks and hyperedges represent analyst coverage, connecting his/her similar companies. Using no additional information, we perform hypergraph partitioning to form clusters of stocks. Our scalable scheme can produce any number of clusters and can automatically update as research firms change analyst coverage as opposed to today's leading industry schemes which have only fixed numbers of industries and require periodic expert review. Can our crowdsourced scheme match the quality of stock groups from the expert-driven schemes? We make head-to-head comparisons to a leading academic and a leading commercial scheme using a methodology from the finance community that measures the coincidence of stock price movements. We also compare our scheme against a clusterer that creates groups based on past return correlations. Our results rival and often exceed all three schemes. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Analyst coverages; Form clusters; Government agencies; Hypergraph partitioning; Industry classification; Leading industry; Number of clusters; Stock price movements; Artificial intelligence; Research; Risk management; Industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885990494

These algorithms, however, do not pay attention to the reconstruction of roles, i.e. they do not group activities according to the skills required to perform them. Information about roles in business processes is commonly considered important and explicitly integrated into the process representation, e.g. as swimlanes in BPMN diagrams. This work proposes an approach to enhance a business process model with information on roles. Specifically, the identification of roles is based on the detection of handover of roles. On the basis of candidates for roles handover, the set of activities is first partitioned and then subsets of activities which are performed by the same originators are merged, so to obtain roles. All significant partitions of activities are automatically generated. Experimental results on several logs show that the set of generated roles is not too large and it always contains the correct definition of roles. We also propose an entropy based measure to rank the candidate roles which returns promising experimental results. © 2013 IEEE.","organizational mining; process enhancement; process mining; social network analysis","Automatically generated; Business Process; Business process model; Discovery algorithm; Group activities; Process enhancements; Process mining; Process representation; Algorithms; Data mining; Social networking (online); Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885642180

High-tech systems such as X-ray machines and high-end copiers provide their manufacturers and services organizations with detailed event data. Larger organizations record relevant business events for process improvement, auditing, and fraud detection. Traces in such event logs can be classified as desirable or undesirable (e.g., faulty or fraudulent behavior). In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for discovering signatures that can be used to explain or predict the class of seen or unseen traces. These signatures are characteristic patterns that can be used to discriminate between desirable and undesirable behavior. As shown, these patterns can, for example, be used to predict remotely whether a particular component in an X-ray machine is broken or not. Moreover, the signatures also help to improve systems and organizational processes. Our framework for signature discovery is fully implemented in ProM and supports class labeling, feature extraction and selection, pattern discovery, pattern evaluation and cross-validation, reporting, and visualization. A real-life case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and scalability of the approach. © 2013 IEEE.","Discriminatory Patterns; Event Log; Process Mining; Signature Patterns","Discriminatory Patterns; Event Log; Feature extraction and selection; Organizational process; Process Improvement; Process mining; Signature discovery; Signature Patterns; Data mining; Feature extraction; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885632286

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey is used to assess attitudes toward four scenarios defining the range of possible outcomes of the global megacrisis, and an improved Delphi method estimates when emerging technologies are likely to enter mainstream use. Findings: The survey shows that people think there is a strong likelihood these trends will cause major global disasters or a collapse of civilization in large parts of the globe. Macro-forecasts of the Technology Revolution suggest that the rise of e-commerce, green business, climate control, alternative energy, artificial intelligence, and other technological advances are likely to move the world to a more sophisticated level of development about 2020. Research limitations/implications: Trend analysis and ""collective intelligence"" methods, such as attitude surveys and Delphi studies, involve some degree of uncertainty Practical implications: Results clarify how that today's global threats are part of a broader evolutionary passage to an advanced global order. Originality/value: The evolutionary perspective is an original approach to global affairs, and the forecasts are from what may possibly be the best forecasting system available. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consciousness; Forecasting; Globalization; Governance; Knowledge economy; Technology-led strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885071524

Nodes in WSN transmit data to the sink which is fully equipped with energy source and from sink data is transmitted to base station which is capable of connecting the WSN to an existing communications infrastructure or to Internet where user can access to reported information. Sensor nodes near to sink is transmitted their own information as well as forward information from the outer nodes. After some time, sensor nodes near to the sink will lose their energy and then die although outer region nodes are still alive, but information cannot be transmitted to sink because inner region sensor nodes are dead means energy hole comes near to sink, so lifetime of WSN is affected. To minimize energy-hole problem near sink and prolong lifetime of WSN, different approaches are used. In our approach, nodes according to exponential distribution are deployed then ant colony optimization technique is used to route the information. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Ant colony optimization routing; Energy hole; Exponential distribution; Wireless sensor network","Communications infrastructure; Energy holes; Energy source; Energy-hole problems; Exponential distributions; Inner region; Node distribution; Transmit data; Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884721638

This, however, only covers known risks having punctual effects upon the IT infrastructure. In contrast, the notion of resilience, as a refinement of trustworthiness, is getting attention both in academia and within organizations as a denominator to move beyond survival and even prosper in the face of adverse conditions. This paper reports on ongoing work towards the development of PREDEC, a detective framework to realize resilience in the context of business processes. Specifically, it firstly motivates the need for operational resilience and corresponding tool support at the level of processes. Secondly, it sketches the operation and building blocks of PREDEC, which currently employs process mining techniques to analyze process event logs to assess systems' resilience. Finally, it describes the intended evaluation steps to be undertaken once PREDEC is completely implemented. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Automated Detection; Operational Resilience; Process Intelligence; Resilient BPM","Automated detection; Building blockes; Business Process; Complex information; IT infrastructures; Operational Resilience; Process intelligence; Resilient BPM; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884716760

Building on a property of acyclic graphs, we suggest in this paper a new representation of the solutions of the FVSP (feedback sets). Thanks to this solution representation, we are able to design a local transformation (equivalent to a neighborhood) that changes a feedback set into a new one.

The environmental impact of higher livestock concentration is particularly significant where it coincides with weaker policy standards and poor manure management. Effective tools for environmental monitoring of the swine sewage management process become essential for verifying the environmental compatibility of farming facilities and for defining suitable policies aimed at increasing swine production sustainability. This research aims at the development and application of a model for a quick assessment of the environmental effectiveness of the pig farming sewage management process. In order to define the model, multicriteria techniques, and in particular, Saaty's analytic hierarchy process, were used to develop an iterative process in which the various key factors influencing the process under investigation were analyzed. The model, named EASE (Environmental Assessment of Sewages management Effectiveness), was optimized and applied to the Lake Trasimeno basin (Umbria, Italy), an area of high natural, environmental and aesthetic value.

The selected algorithms are a population-based and a trajectory-based algorithms (DEPT and MO-VNS, respectively), three swarm intelligence algorithms (MOABC, MO-FA, and MO-GSA), a genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and SPEA2. The MDP is one of the most important sequence analysis problems related to discover common patterns, motifs, in DNA sequences. A motif is a nucleic acid sequence pattern that has some biological significance as being DNA binding sites for a regulatory protein, i.e.; a transcription factor (TF). A biologically relevant motif must have a certain length, be found in many sequences, and present a high similarity among the subsequences which compose it. These three goals are in conflict with each other, therefore a multiobjective approach is a good way of facing the MDP. In addition, in recent years, scientists are decoding genomes of many organisms, increasing the computational workload of the algorithms. Therefore, we need algorithms that are able to deal with these new large DNA instances. The obtained experimental results suggest that MOABC and MO-FA are the algorithms with the best scalability behaviours. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer science; DNA; Evolutionary algorithm; Multiobjective programming; Scalability analysis","Biological significance; Computational workload; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective approach; Multiobjective programming; Scalability analysis; Swarm intelligence algorithms; Trajectory-based algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Computer science; DNA; Evolutionary algorithms; Scalability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885422948

Among them, plasma flow mass enthalpy, flow thermal conductivity, momentum density, etc. result from the selection of extrinsic operating parameters such as the plasma torch nozzle geometry, the composition and flow rate of plasma forming gases, the arc current intensity, beside the coupled relationships between those operating parameters make difficult in a full prediction of their effects on coating properties. Moreover, temporal fluctuations (anode wear for example) require ""real time"" corrections to maintain particle characteristic to targeted values. An expert system is built to optimize and control some of the main extrinsic operating parameters.

The paper details the general architecture of the system, discusses its limits and the typical characteristic times. The result shows that ANN can predict the characteristics of particles in-flight from coating porosity within maximal error 3 and 2 % in temperature and velocity respectively.

A few of them are based on Swarm-Intelligence Algorithms, which are inspired by the collective behavior of social organisms. One of the most successful of such algorithms is the Differential Ant-Stigmergy Algorithm (DASA), which uses stigmergy, a method of communication in emergent systems where the individual parts (artificial ants) of the system communicate with one another by modifying their local environment (pheromone intensity). The main characteristic of the DASA is its underlying structure (pheromone graph) that uses discrete steps to move through a continuous search space. As a consequence of this the search-space movement is in some way limited and the algorithm's time/space complexity is increased. In order to overcome the problem an improved algorithm called the Continuous Differential Ant-Stigmergy Algorithm (CDASA) is proposed and then benchmarked on standard benchmark functions. This benchmarking showed that the CDASA performs better than the DASA, especially at lower dimensions, that its time/space complexity is decreased, and that the algorithm code is simplified. As such, the CDASA is more suitable for parallel implementations on General-Purpose Graphic Processing Units. Compared to the Swarm-Intelligence Algorithms presented in this paper, the CDASA is the best-performing algorithm and competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms belonging to different metaheuristic approaches. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant-colony optimization; Metaheuristics; Numerical optimization; Stigmergy; Swarm intelligence","Differential ant-stigmergy algorithms; Graphic processing units; Meta heuristics; Numerical optimizations; Parallel implementations; State-of-the-art algorithms; Stigmergy; Swarm Intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Heuristic algorithms; Population statistics; Ant colony optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884818503

Motivated by this consequence, we propose a methodology to evaluate the monthly heat wave hazard and risk and its spatial distribution within large cities. A simple urban climate model with assimilated satellite-derived land surface temperature images was used to generate a historic database of urban air temperature fields. Heat wave hazard was then estimated from the analysis of these hourly air temperatures distributed at a 1-km grid over Athens, Greece, by identifying the areas that are more likely to suffer higher temperatures in the case of a heat wave event. Innovation lies in the artificial intelligence fuzzy logic model that was used to classify the heat waves from mild to extreme by taking into consideration their duration, intensity and time of occurrence. The monthly hazard was subsequently estimated as the cumulative effect from the individual heat waves that occurred at each grid cell during a month. Finally, monthly heat wave risk maps were produced integrating geospatial information on the population vulnerability to heat waves calculated from socio-economic variables. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fuzzy logic; Heat wave; Satellite images; Urban climate","Cumulative effects; Geo-spatial informations; Heat waves; Land surface temperature; Satellite images; Summer temperature; Urban climate modeling; Urban climates; Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Fuzzy logic; Maps; Risk assessment; Hazards; air temperature; artificial intelligence; climate modeling; fuzzy mathematics; hazard assessment; risk assessment; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; urban climate; air temperature; article; artificial intelligence; climate change; environmental temperature; fuzzy logic; Greece; hazard assessment; heat stress; high temperature; humidity; methodology; morbidity; mortality; risk assessment; socioeconomics; summer; urban area; Artificial Intelligence; Climate Change; Fuzzy Logic; Hot Temperature; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884350565

These tactics are more adaptive to the environment's changes (reservation interval, time deadline, opponent behavior). The suggested time dependent tactics take advantage from round based time continuity and dynamics aspects (features) integrated in their modelling. For suggested behavior dependent tactics, a new formalization based on the percentage of change was introduced, which helps agents to be more prudent in the environments with incomplete information comparing to previous behavior dependent tactics suggested by Faratin et al. (Int. J. Robotics Auton. Syst. 24(3-4):159-182, 1998). Concerning the new family of tactics which are completely independent from time, the agents compute their offers based on their reservation interval. These tactics are useful when there is no time deadline and, in addition, when the behavior of opponent agents doesn't follow any negotiation equilibrium. Moreover, new experimental measures are suggested which are more useful for final evaluation. The experiments conducted in this paper, prove the applicability of all three families of tactic. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Agent based automated negotiation; Artificial intelligence; Negotiation; Negotiation tactics","Adaptive approach; Adaptive decision making; Automated negotiations; Bilateral negotiations; Incomplete information; Negotiation; Negotiation tactics; Time-dependent tactic; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884290796

It has been shown that the use of virtual coordinates or identifiers for efficient routing and data management has several advantages compared to classical topology control techniques based on pre-defined addresses or geographical coordinates. However, these advantages only hold for single domain networks with limited mobility. In a previous paper, we discussed the challenges arising from using virtual coordinates for routing (to a particular destination ID or to indexed data or resources) in mobile networks in multi-domain network scenarios. We developed a solution by managing data with a distributed hash table scheme. Based on our virtual cord protocol, we then implemented inter-domain routing using appropriate indirections. That approach, however, was still limited in finding efficient routes over multiple transit networks. In this paper, we extend that work by defining a framework for optimized inter-domain routing. In particular, we investigate the use of ant colony optimization for optimizing routes between multiple network domains. We show how distributed routing tables can be created and maintained and we outline a heuristic for finding candidate routes. Simulation experiments confirm the efficiency of the selected routes both on a intra and on a inter-domain level. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant colony optimization; Inter-domain routing; Mobile networks; Virtual cord protocol","Classical topologies; Distributed Hash Table; Distributed routing; Geographical coordinates; Interdomain Routing; Multidomain networks; Multiple networks; Virtual coordinates; Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Dense wavelength division multiplexing; Information management; Mobile ad hoc networks; Telecommunication networks; Wireless networks; Virtual addresses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884282092

However a common procedure about the exploitation of model results is not established yet. Vulnerability is used to characterize the performance of the system, and it can be a helpful indicator in the evaluation of the most likely failures. In this paper a water allocation model is applied to the water supply system of the upper Tiber Basin (Central Italy) in which both surface waters (rivers, reservoirs) and ground waters (wells, springs) are exploited to feed mainly irrigation and civil users. Drought vulnerability indices are calculated to analyze the performance of the supply system under different climate and management conditions. Water shortage scenarios are simulated as a progressive reduction of mean precipitation, an increase in its standard deviation or a combination of both. The model shows that the safety of the water supply system mainly relies on the reservoirs and that the foreseen increased exploitation of the springs to replace contaminated wells, could be seriously limited by discharge decrease during fall. The vulnerability reduction obtained by a hypothetical augmentation of the storage capacity through additional small reservoirs was positively tested by the model. In conclusion vulnerability indices and synoptic risk maps demonstrated to be useful tools to analyze the model outputs. They provide easy-to-read scenarios to be used in a decision making framework considering negotiating among the main users. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Decision support system; Drought management; Integrated water resources management; Water allocation model; Water shortage","Decision-making frameworks; Drought management; Integrated Water Resources Management; Mean precipitation; Vulnerability index; Vulnerability reductions; Water allocation models; Water shortages; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Computer simulation; Decision support systems; Groundwater; Maps; Water resources; Water supply; Water supply systems; Drought; climate change; decision support system; drought; groundwater; integrated approach; negotiation process; numerical model; reservoir; resource allocation; risk assessment; surface water; vulnerability; water management; water supply; Italy; Tiber Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883753290

Medical equipment represents a significant share of yearly healthcare operational costs; hence, ensuring an effective and efficient management of such key assets is critical to promptly and reliably deliver a diversity of clinical services at the patient bedside. Empirical evidence from a phased-out RFID implementation in one European hospital demonstrates that RFID has the potential to transform asset management by improving inventorymanagement, enhancing asset utilization, increasing staff productivity, improving care services, enhancing maintenance compliance, and increasing information visibility. Most importantly, RFID allows the emergence of intelligent asset management processes, which is, undoubtedly, the most important benefit that could be derived from the RFID system. Results show that the added intelligence can be rather basic (auto-status change) or a bit more advanced (personalized automatic triggers). More importantly, adding intelligence improves planning and decision-making processes. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Added-intelligence; Hospitals; Inefficiencies; Intelligent processes; Mobile assetsmanagement; RFID","article; artificial intelligence; health care management; health care planning; health care utilization; hospital management; hospital personnel management; human; medical decision making; medical device; medical information; medical technology; radiofrequency identification; health care delivery; health service; hospital; intelligence; patient identification; radio frequency identification device; radiofrequency radiation; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Administration; Hospitals; Humans; Intelligence; Patient Identification Systems; Radio Frequency Identification Device; Radio Waves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881302166

In the context of door opening, we demonstrate that data-driven object-centric models can be used to haptically recognize specific doors, haptically recognize classes of door (e.g.; refrigerator vs. kitchen cabinet), and haptically detect anomalous forces while opening a door, even when opening a specific door for the first time. We also demonstrate that two distinct robots can use forces captured from people opening doors to better detect anomalous forces.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for multi-object categorization within the BoF framework. The approach addresses two issues in BoF related methods simultaneously: how to avoid scene modeling and how to predict labels of an image when multiple categories of objects are co-existing. We employ a biased sampling strategy which combines the bottom-up, biologically inspired saliency information and loose, top-down class prior information for object class modeling. Then this biased sampling component is further integrated with a multi-instance multi-label leaning and classification algorithm. With the proposed biased sampling strategy, we can perform multiobject categorization within an image without semantic segmentation. The experimental results on PASCAL VOC2007 and SUN09 show that the proposed method significantly improves the discriminative ability of BoF methods and achieves good performance in multi-object categorization tasks. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Bag-of-features method; Biased sampling strategy; Multi-instance multi-label learning; Object categorization","Bag-of-Features; Biased sampling; Biologically inspired; Classification algorithm; Discriminative ability; Multi-instance multi-label learning; Object categorization; Semantic segmentation; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879334330

However, Trust Management experts are rarely contacted for the design of distributed business applications. Developers of these kinds of business applications are not familiar with latest results and are only aware of a very limited set of applicable solutions. This hinders the adaption of these novel security solutions into provided future services. To support the integration of Trust Management into these areas we defined a design process, which can be applied systematically by developers. Based on the design process they can use their scenario knowledge to narrow down their design space and finally select from a limited set of applicable implementations the best fit. We extended the static TrustFraMM meta-description of Trust Management in a way to enable it to support the exploration and exclusion of existing trust functionality implementations.

It is a high demand area because many organizations and businesses can benefit from it. There is no doubt that it is a great idea to use data mining tools in the healthcare systems to improve decisions made by the experts in this field. It has been seen that certain groups of people living in certain areas of the world with certain food diets carry certain diseases more than some other groups of people. It will be a great contribution to the healthcare system to know what the root of this type of problems is. The most critical challenge in this contribution is the issue of data management and utilization. Data mining algorithms can be used to find useful patterns in the patients' statistical data to find the associations among certain disease and possible causes of them. Thus, health care organizations are finding value as well as strategic applications to mining patient data, in general, and community data, in particular. While significant gains can be obtained and have been noted at the organizational level of analysis, much attention has been given to the individual, where the focal points have centered on privacy and security of patient data. While the privacy debate is a salient issue, data mining (DM) offers broader community-based gains that enable and improve healthcare forecasting, analyses, and visualization. This paper will study a few cases where data mining has been used to mine patient data to make decisions about patients and investigates how data mining can be beneficial in the context of healthcare system. ©American Society for Engineering education, 2013.",,"Critical challenges; Data mining algorithm; Health-care system; Healthcare industry; Healthcare organizations; Management and utilization; Organizational levels; Privacy and security; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information management; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884337196

Companies like PTC, Dassault Systèmes, AutoDesk and Siemens NX, are making this dream a reality. Just because one very expensive piece of software can handle most aspects of engineering development that does not mean that it is flexible. Nor can it be adapted to individual companies and their standard practices. This gives companies the false hope of true integration, where the same information has to be entered multiple times, and no time is saved when working between modules. True integration occurs at the point where both customization and artificial intelligence meet, to produce an outcome that saves both time and money. Through the use of API's (Application Programming Interface) and custom software, true integration is closer to becoming a reality. The focus of this project is to develop a customized software program geared toward small to midsized job-shop companies that cannot afford all-inone software packages. Software like SolidWorks, FeatureCAM, and Microsoft Office, are commonly used by such companies and with the aid of API's, a software will have the ability to communicate directly to objects inside each program. In particular, this software will focus on the transition between design, engineering, and manufacturing and the information that is passed between each stage of development. The results of this project demonstrate that the potential exists to enhance and simplify the product development process, but many questions remain unanswered and future technologies may help to unlock the key to full integration. For most mechanical engineering students, computer programming can be a challenging class. Due to the limited number of classes that engineers are required to take on the subject, programming is notoriously presented in a dry and non enthusiastic way. However, through the use of API's, students can connect more easily with programming concepts because it would involve an additional subject that they are more familiar with like parametric modeling and CNC programming.

Accumulating evidence suggests that in many instances this process is specifically regulated and contributes to the structural and functional diversification of tissues and cell types. Furthermore, several studies support the view that environmental stresses dramatically impact on AS and reported the presence of novel transcript isoforms in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Since specific regulation of AS in plants is a largely unexplored field of research, large-scale approaches aimed at monitoring AS on a genome-wide level are of increasing importance to gain insights into tissue-specific splicing regulation and to study the effects of changed environmental conditions on pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we describe the concepts of a traditional statistical approach, and a more recently developed machine learning-based method for AS detection from tiling arrays.

As much as the technological benefits, cloud computing also has its downside. By looking at its financial benefits, customers who cannot afford initial investments, choose cloud by compromising on its concerns, like security, performance, estimation, availability, etc. At the same time due to its risks, customers - relatively majority in number, avoid migration towards cloud. Considering this fact, performance and estimation are being the major critical factors for any application deployment in cloud environment, this paper brings the roadmap for an improved performance-centric cloud storage estimation approach, which is based on balanced PCTFree allocation technique for database systems deployment in cloud environment. Objective of this approach is to highlight the set of key activities that have to be jointly done by the database technical team and business users of the software system in order to perform an accurate analysis to arrive at estimation for sizing of the database. For the evaluation of this approach, an experiment has been performed through varied-size PCTFree allocations on an experimental setup with 100000 data records. The result of this experiment shows the impact of PCTFree configuration on database performance.

An exploratory set of case studies were carried out to understand the benefits, barriers and enablers of adopting serious games in companies and non-educational organizations. Serious games are games that educate, train and inform. It could therefore be expected that serious games would play an important role within corporate training, but this seems not to be the case. Five exploratory case studies of SG adoption were collected. There was use of serious games for training (three cases) and for corporate change interventions (two cases). Most of the organizations commissioned the SG from an external party and only in one case did the organization itself develop the serious game. The key finding was that senior management support was critical for serious game adoption in every case. SG adoption was typically limited to a single department or branch/subsidiary of the company. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Adoption; Business; Industry; Integration; Serious Games; Training","Adoption; Corporate trainings; Exploratory analysis; Exploratory case studies; Learning alliances; Senior management support; Serious games; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Industry; Integration; Personnel training; Societies and institutions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883379984

We addressed this question as a transformative journey from island of knowledge to mutual understanding in the context of collaborative decision making in creative global business meetings. The paper presents: (1) a mutual understanding metric (MUM) and method for self assessment and 360 team assessment that define different MUM stages in the journey from island of knowledge to mutual understanding; and (2) an engagement Matrix of Choices (eMOC) prototype to assist cross-disciplinary, global teams to make explicit choices with an understanding of the level of collaboration and engagement they can achieve and the respective enablers and hindrances. We present ""six steps to engagement"" framework that offers three feedback loops as triggers to improve the local and global collaboration context and behavior, and three choice-decision-commitment steps towards improving the work environment and increasing knowledge work productivity. We argue that iterative and continuous MUM assessment, explicit eMOC choices, are central to achieve mutual understanding, high performance teamwork, and eliminate re-work, coordination, and decision wait time. The rapid prototyping and testing observations indicate that MUM and eMOC: (1) Allow team members to build awareness of their local conditions and make their local conditions transparent and visible to the rest of the team. (2) Provide a feedback mechanism that indicates the engagement potential of each team member and the team, as well as a trigger or nudge towards moving to higher levels of engagement.

No hard consensus exists on the elements of an all-embracing theory, or on what specific sub-processes and representations are required to support creativity, either in humans or in machines. Yet commonalities do exist across theories: a search for novelty and utility is implied by most theories, as is the notion that an innovation can be considered creative only if it is not too novel, and can be adequately grounded in the familiar and the understandable. Computational creativity (CC) is the pursuit of creative behavior in machines, and seeks inspiration from both AI and from human psychology. As a practical engineering endeavor, CC can afford to adopt a cafeteria approach to theories of creativity, taking what it needs from different theories and frameworks. In this paper we present a vision for CC research in the age of the Web, in which CC is provided on tap, via a suite of Web services, to any third-party application that needs it. We argue that this notion of Creativity as a Service - which is already a popular business model for human organizations - will allow CC researchers and developers to build ad-hoc mash-ups of whatever processes and representations are most suited to a given application. By offering CC as a centralized service, we can collect statistics on the most useful mash-ups, and therein obtain a new empirical basis for theorizing about creativity in humans and in machines.

Crowdsourcing is a technology-enabled way of working which offers the potential to bring work to far flung communities. However, it is something of a double-edged sword and there are many socio-technical and ethical challenges. In the micro-task market crowdsourcing platforms tend to be designed largely for the advantage of the organisation requesting work, rather than the worker. This paper contributes to research calling to redress this balance [2, 6]. It describes the findings of an ethnographic study of an outsourced business process - healthcare form digitization - as performed by workers in-office (India) and @Home (USA). It reveals the complexities of the relationships between worker and organisation and argues that designing some aspects of these relationships into crowdsourcing platforms and applications is as beneficial for the organisation as it is for the worker. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","business process outsourcing; Crowdsourcing; ethnography; relationship- based crowdsourcing","Business Process; Business process outsourcing; Crowdsourcing; Crowdsourcing platforms; Ethnographic study; ethnography; Sociotechnical; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883270020

Agent research offers a variety of approaches and tools to automate negotiations. Currently these technologies have the drawback that the human manager retains the responsibility for the outcome of a negotiation, but this person most often does not have the required knowledge to define the agent's behavior by himself. To increase acceptability of automated negotiation approaches, we consider it necessary that human negotiators can specify the strategies for the agents. In this article we present a meta model, which enables human negotiators to specify trade-off strategies. Trade-off strategies are a key concept in negotiation in general. This meta model is based on the Ecore meta model. The specified trade-off strategies can automatically be transformed into representations that can be used by an agent. Our meta model provides a model and a graphical notation that allows it to create graphical editors for trade-off strategies. Therefore, it becomes possible to specify trade-off strategies without any programming knowledge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","automated negotiation; MDD; trade-off strategies","Automate negotiation; Automated negotiations; Graphical editors; Graphical notation; MDD; Model driven approach; Programming knowledge; trade-off strategies; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883264889

In our approach, annotations are defined by specifying the effects of atomic tasks, including the obligations they generate, using Artificial Intelligence techniques for reasoning about actions and the notion of commitment developed in the context of a social approach to agent communication. Verifying the compliance of a business process to a regulation includes checking that, in all executions of the business process, all the obligations triggered by the norms are fulfilled.

The approach has been implemented in the DiagFlow tool, which reads and diagnoses annotated XPDL models, using a state-of-the-art constraint solver as back end. Using this novel approach, complex semantic workflow models can be verified and diagnosed in an efficient way. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

First we extend the hybrid theory by making the connection with reasoning towards legal consequences. We then emphasise the role of legal stories (as opposed to the factual stories of the hybrid theory). Legal stories provide a coherent, holistic legal perspective on a case. They steer what needs to be proven but are also selected on the basis of what can be proven. We show how these legal stories can be used to model a shift of the legal perspective on a case, and we discuss how gaps in a legal story can be filled using a factual story (i.e. the process of reasoning with circumstantial evidence).

In this study we report the results obtained by using stylometric techniques to identify deceptive statements in a corpus of hearings collected in Italian courts. The defendants at these hearings were condemned for calumny or false testimony, so the falsity of (some of) their statements is fairly certain. In our experiments we replicated the methods used in previous studies but never before applied to high-stakes data, and tested new methods. We also considered the effect of a number of variables including in particular the homogeneity of the dataset.

However, SC requires the use of computing eigenvectors, making it time consuming. To overcome this limitation, Lin and Cohen proposed the power iteration clustering (PIC) technique (Lin and Cohen in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 655-662, 2010), which is a simple and fast version of SC. Instead of finding the eigenvectors, PIC finds only one pseudo-eigenvector, which is a linear combination of the eigenvectors in linear time. However, in certain critical situations, using only one pseudo-eigenvector is not enough for clustering because of the inter-class collision problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the deflation technique to compute multiple orthogonal pseudo-eigenvectors (orthogonality is used to avoid redundancy). Our method is more accurate than PIC but has the same computational complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the improvement of our approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Deflation; Power iteration; Spectral clustering","Clustering techniques; Collision problem; Conventional approach; Deflation; Hier-archical clustering; Linear combinations; Power iteration; Spectral clustering; Artificial intelligence; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882827604

Therefore, by introducing fuzzy goals and an interactive fuzzy satisficing method, the proposed model is transformed into a deterministic equivalent problem. Furthermore, to obtain the exact optimal portfolio analytically, a solution method is developed by introducing the auxiliary problem and performing equivalent transformations.

This study focuses on the prediction of rock burst classification with case instances using cloud models and attribution weight. First, cloud models are introduced briefly related to the rock burst classification problem. Then, the attribution weight method is presented to quantify the contribution of each rock burst indicator for classification. The approach is implemented to predict the classes of rock burst intensity for the 164 rock burst instances collected. The clustering figures are generated by cloud models for each rock burst class. The computed weight values of the indicators show that the stress ratio Ts = σtheta/σc is the most vulnerable parameter and the elastic strain energy storage index Wet and the brittleness factor B = σc/σt take the second and third place, respectively, contributing to the rock burst classification. Besides, the predictive performance of the strategy introduced in this study is compared with that of some empirical methods, the regression analysis, the neural networks and support vector machines. The results turn out that cloud models perform better than the empirical methods and regression analysis and have superior generalization ability than the neural networks in modelling the rock burst cases. Hence, cloud models are feasible and applicable for prediction of rock burst classification. Finally, different models with varying indicators are investigated to validate the parameter sensitivity results obtained by cloud clustering analysis and regression analysis in context to rock burst classification. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Attribution weight; Cloud models; Computational intelligence; Neural networks; Prediction; Rock burst classification; Support vector machines","artificial neural network; cluster analysis; elasticity; empirical analysis; hard rock; numerical model; prediction; regression analysis; rock mass classification; rockburst; strain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881051376

In novelty search, solutions are rewarded based on their novelty, rather than their quality with respect to a predefined objective. The lack of a predefined objective precludes premature convergence caused by a deceptive fitness function. In this paper, we apply novelty search combined with NEAT to the evolution of neural controllers for homogeneous swarms of robots. Our empirical study is conducted in simulation, and we use a common swarm robotics task-aggregation, and a more challenging task-sharing of an energy recharging station. Our results show that novelty search is unaffected by deception, is notably effective in bootstrapping evolution, can find solutions with lower complexity than fitness-based evolution, and can find a broad diversity of solutions for the same task. Even in non-deceptive setups, novelty search achieves solution qualities similar to those obtained in traditional fitness-based evolution. Our study also encompasses variants of novelty search that work in concert with fitness-based evolution to combine the exploratory character of novelty search with the exploitatory character of objective-based evolution. We show that these variants can further improve the performance of novelty search. Overall, our study shows that novelty search is a promising alternative for the evolution of controllers for robotic swarms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Behavioural diversity; Deception; Evolutionary robotics; NEAT; Neuroevolution; Novelty search; Swarm robotics","Health; Robotics; Behavioural diversity; Deception; Evolutionary robotics; NEAT; Neuro evolutions; Novelty search; Swarm robotics; Swarm intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880792945

An ideal solution could be a 'swarm calculus' that allows to calculate key features of swarms such as expected swarm performance and robustness based on only a few parameters. To work towards this ideal, one needs to find methods and models with high degrees of generality. In this paper, we report two models that might be examples of exceptional generality. First, an abstract model is presented that describes swarm performance depending on swarm density based on the dichotomy between cooperation and interference. Typical swarm experiments are given as examples to show how the model fits to several different results. Second, we give an abstract model of collective decision making that is inspired by urn models. The effects of positive-feedback probability, that is increasing over time in a decision making system, are understood by the help of a parameter that controls the feedback based on the swarm's current consensus. Several applicable methods, such as the description as Markov process, calculation of splitting probabilities, mean first passage times, and measurements of positive feedback, are discussed and applications to artificial and natural swarms are reported. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Collective decision-making; Positive feedback; Swarm performance; Urn model","Calculations; Decision making; Markov processes; Collective decision; Collective decision making; Decision-making systems; Design Methodology; Mean first passage time; Swarm performance; Universal properties; Urn models; Feedback",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880763810

The overall quality of a composite index depends upon the complexity of phenomena of interest as well as the relevance of the methodological approach used to aggregate the various indicators into a single composite index. However, current aggregation methods used to estimate the composite road safety performance index suffer from various deficiencies at both the theoretical and operational level; these include the correlation and compensability between indicators, the weighting of the indicators as well as their high ""degree of freedom"" which enables one to readily manipulate them to produce desired outcomes (Munda and Nardo, 2003, 2005, 2009). The objective of this study is to contribute to the ongoing research effort on the estimation of road safety composite index for hotspots' identification and ranking.

Clustering or unsupervised learning is a technique of computational intelligence that can be used to identify natural clusters or groups of disturbances. The understanding of disturbances is important for planning and maintenance, and may lead to fresh insights which prove useful in upgrade of infrastructure. Ideally this should be a fully automated process, so that no bias is introduced by the practitioner. The complete process involves several steps including data cleaning, transformation, feature selection, clustering, evaluation of clusters, cluster description and cluster interpretation. We designate this process as the Clustering Knowledge Chain, beginning with raw data and ending with new knowledge. This case study examines each of these steps, showing how they might be applied in a situation involving real-world data, and illustrates some of the difficulties that a practitioner with domain knowledge may encounter. Results from this case study reveal new knowledge about electrical disturbances, but also show that selection of parameters using a quantitative measure of clustering quality is not enough, by itself, to guarantee clusters that can inform the practitioner. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Cluster description; Clustering quality; Domain knowledge; Electrical disturbances; Natural clusters; Potential benefits; Quality assessment; Quantitative measures; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Industrial electronics; Research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881469340

Cyber credit card fraud or no card present fraud is increasingly rampant in the recent years for the reason that the credit card is majorly used to request payments by these companies on the internet. Therefore the need to ensure secured transactions for credit-card owners when consuming their credit cards to make electronic payments for goods and services provided on the internet is a criterion. Data mining has popularly gained recognition in combating cyber credit-card fraud because of its effective artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and algorithms that can be implemented to detect or predict fraud through Knowledge Discovery from unusual patterns derived from gathered data. In this study, a system's model for cyber credit card fraud detection is discussed and designed. This system implements the supervised anomaly detection algorithm of Data mining to detect fraud in a real time transaction on the internet, and thereby classifying the transaction as legitimate, suspicious fraud and illegitimate transaction. The anomaly detection algorithm is designed on the Neural Networks which implements the working principal of the human brain (as we humans learns from past experience and then make our present day decisions on what we have learned from our past experience). To understand how cyber credit card fraud are being committed, in this study the different types of cyber fraudsters that commit cyber credit card fraud and the techniques used by these cyber fraudsters to commit fraud on the internet is discussed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","black-hat hackers; Cyber credit card fraud; cyber credit card fraudsters; data mining; neural networks","Anomaly-detection algorithms; black-hat hackers; Credit card fraud detections; Credit card frauds; Data mining applications; Fraud detection system; Fraudsters; Real-time transactions; Data mining; Industry; Internet; Neural networks; Personal computing; Signal detection; Crime",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881246906

Traditional approaches to the problem have factored in demographics, revenue and aggregated human flow statistics from nearby or remote areas. However, the acquisition of relevant data is usually expensive. With the growth of location-based social networks, fine grained data describing user mobility and popularity of places has recently become attainable. In this paper we study the predictive power of various machine learning features on the popularity of retail stores in the city through the use of a dataset collected from Foursquare in New York. The features we mine are based on two general signals: geographic, where features are formulated according to the types and density of nearby places, and user mobility, which includes transitions between venues or the incoming flow of mobile users from distant areas. Our evaluation suggests that the best performing features are common across the three different commercial chains considered in the analysis, although variations may exist too, as explained by heterogeneities in the way retail facilities attract users. We also show that performance improves significantly when combining multiple features in supervised learning algorithms, suggesting that the retail success of a business may depend on multiple factors.

In this study, the IMG-ACO algorithm utilizing traditional multigroup framework and mutation mechanism performs the virtual parallel optimization algorithm. Compared with the MG-ACO, the results show that the shortest path improved by about 11.5, 16.8, and 9.1% for 60, 90, and 120 nodes, respectively.

This scheme enables users to control the level of asymmetry that can be ignored in merging a pair of objects.

One of the challenging issues in transfer learning is how to handle the distribution differences between the source domains and the target domain. Most studies in the research field implicitly assume that data distributions from the source domains and the target domain are similar in a well-designed feature space. However, it is often the case that label assignments for data in the source domains and the target domain are significantly different. Therefore, in reality even if the distribution difference between a source domain and a target domain is reduced, the knowledge from multiple source domains is not well transferred to the target domain unless the label information is carefully considered. In addition, noisy data often emerge in real world applications. Therefore, considering how to handle noisy data in the transfer learning setting is a challenging problem, as noisy data inevitably cause a side effect during the knowledge transfer. Due to the above reasons, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a robust framework against noise in the transfer learning setting. We also explicitly consider the difference in data distributions and label assignments among multiple source domains and the target domain. Experimental results on one synthetic data set, three UCI data sets and one real world text data set in different noise levels demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cross-task classification; Noise handling; Supervised transfer learning","Data distribution; Knowledge transfer; Label information; Learning paradigms; Noise handling; Noisy environment; Synthetic datasets; Transfer learning; Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882249714

Reductionists maintain that cellular and molecular mechanisms can explain mental phenomena without necessary appeal to higher-level mechanisms. Mechanists deny this claim. I argue that this dispute turns on whether reduction is a transitive relation. I show that it is. Therefore, mechanistic explanations at the cellular and molecular level explain mental phenomena. I make my case in part by noting that mechanisms at higher levels are composed of mechanisms at lower levels. Compositional relations are transitive. In addition, they are explanatory. I conclude that there are explanatory linkages from cellular and molecular mechanisms to mental phenomena within a hierarchy of nested mechanisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Composition; Explanation; Mechanism; Neuroscience; Reduction","Explanation; Molecular levels; Molecular mechanism; Neuroscience; Transitive relation; Chemical analysis; Mechanisms; Philosophical aspects; Reduction; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881163175

Plenty of parameters related to user preferences, application requirements, and network conditions, such as; data rate, service cost, network latency, speed of mobile, battery level, interference ratio and etc. must be considered in vertical handoff process along with traditional RSSI information. In this study, a new artificial neural network based handoff decision algorithm is proposed in order to reduce the handoff latency of smart terminal deployed in aforementioned wireless heterogeneous infrastructures. The prominent parameters data rate, monetary cost and RSSI information are taken as inputs of the developed vertical handoff decision system.

According to the results obtained, the proposed neural network based vertical handoff decision algorithm is able to determine whether a handoff is necessary or not properly, and selects the best candidate access network considering the abovementioned parameters. The results also show that, the neural network based algorithm developed significantly reduces the handoff latency while the number of handoffs, which is another vital performance metric, is still reasonable. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Artificial neural networks; Complexity analysis; Handoff latency; Vertical handoff","Complexity analysis; Handoff decision algorithm; Handoff Latency; Multiple attribute decision making; Next-generation wireless network; Vertical handoff; Vertical handoff algorithms; Vertical handoff decision algorithm; Algorithms; Complex networks; Local area networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880793897

Wind farms from around the world have continued to thrive due to its cost-effectiveness and benefits. However, an utmost concern for wind farm operators is to keep the turbines in good working conditions in order to produce power at the most optimal level. For wind turbines, a maintenance activity can be very costly; therefore, it should be carried out from a well-guided decision. An accurate monitoring of a turbine's performance is instrumental for detecting a potentially deteriorating state. In this paper, we present a performance monitoring system for wind turbines based on ANFIS, a hybrid neuro-fuzzy system. By taking advantage of the combined strengths of neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, an accurate modeling of wind turbine performance is established. Its performance is evaluated using actual SCADA and it proves to be a favorable alternative to conventional modeling techniques. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","ANFIS; Artificial intelligence; Clustering; Condition monitoring system; SCADA; Wind turbine system","ANFIS; Clustering; Condition monitoring systems; SCADA; Wind turbine systems; Artificial intelligence; Electric utilities; Fuzzy systems; Information technology; Wind power; Wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880717601

The analytical solution for the site description has not been sufficiently studied due to highly nonlinear behavior of soil. Advances in field of artificial intelligence (AI) offer new insights to solve the problems in the most complex systems utilizing different algorithms and models. This paper primarily aims to predict average shear wave velocity (VS30) as a soil property at the earthquake recording stations by applying AI methods, which are composed of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic expression programming (GEP). The application is performed for the 60-accelerograph station sites located in California, USA. The predictor variables of VS30 in AI models, which are properly organized from strong ground motion data, are magnitude, site-to-source distance, peak ground acceleration and spectral accelerations at different site periods. VS30 values as output variable are collected from the surface wave testings conducted in the sites. The results indicates that for the considered highly nonlinear problem in this paper, the developed ANN and GEP models perform good predictions in terms of error and correlation. It can be concluded that the AI methods are relatively promising for prediction of VS30. The findings from this paper can be helpful to improve the site descriptions at the current database of the study region. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Genetic expression programming; Local site conditions; Neural network; Shear wave velocity; Strong ground motion","Earthquake recording; Genetic Expression Programming; Local site condition; Peak ground acceleration; Predictor variables; Shear wave velocity; Spectral acceleration; Strong ground motion; Acoustic wave velocity; Equations of motion; Forecasting; Genetic programming; Neural networks; Shear waves; Wave propagation; Earthquake effects; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; database; earthquake prediction; ground motion; magnitude; peak acceleration; S-wave; soil property; surface wave; wave velocity; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880618785

These multi-scale features are based on a measure of how likely is a pixel to belong simultaneously to different objects (interpreted as connected components of level sets) and, hence, to be occluded in some of them, providing a hint on the local depth order relationships. They are directly computed on the discrete image data in an efficient manner, without requiring the detection and interpretation of edges or junctions. Its behavior is clarified and illustrated for some simple images. Then the recovery of the relative depth order on the image is achieved by global integration of these local features applying a non-linear diffusion filtering of bilateral type. The validity of the proposed features and the integration approach is demonstrated by experiments on real images and comparison with state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation techniques. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Low-level image features; Monocular depth; Multi-scale analysis; Relative depth order","Connected component; Integration approach; Low-level image features; Monocular depth; Multi scale analysis; Multi-scale features; Nonlinear diffusion; Relative depth order; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879944914

Consequently, numerous statistical prediction models exist in the literature focusing on this particular subject. Besides, artificial intelligence techniques began to attain an increasing level of importance in the literature due to their predictive success. This study distinguishes itself from the similar ones in the sense that it presents a comparison of three different artificial intelligence methods, namely support vector machines (SVMs), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs); in addition to subjecting the explanatory variables to principal component analysis (PCA). The extent of this study encompasses 37 privately owned commercial banks (17 failed, 20 non-failed) that were operating in Turkey for the period of 1997-2001. The main conclusions drawn from the study can be summarized as follows: (i) PCA does not appear to be an effective method with respect to the improvement of predictive power; (ii) SVMs and RBF demonstrated similar levels of predictive power; albeit SVMs was found to be the best model in terms of total predictive power; (iii) MLPs method stood out among the SVMs and RBF methods in a negative sense and exhibits the lowest predictive power. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bank failure; Multilayer perceptrons; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function neural network; Support vector machines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879933924

Empirically based, spatially explicit models can assist city agencies in addressing this important public health concern by identifying areas predicted to exceed public health targets for soil Pb contamination. Sampling of 61 residential properties in Baltimore City using field portable X-ray fluorescence revealed that 53 % had soil Pb that exceeded the USEPA reportable limit of 400 ppm. These data were used as the input to three different spatially explicit models: a traditional general linear model (GLM), and two machine learning techniques: classification and regression trees (CART) and Random Forests (RF). The GLM revealed that housing age, distance to road, distance to building, and the interactions between variables explained 38 % of the variation in the data. The CART model confirmed the importance of these variables, with housing age, distance to building, and distance to major road networks determining the terminal nodes of the CART model. Using the same three predictor variables, the RF model explained 42 % of the variation in the data. The overall accuracy, which is a measure of agreement between the model and an independent dataset, was 90 % for the GLM, 83 % for the CART model, and 72 % for the RF model. A range of spatially explicit models that can be adapted to changing soil Pb guidelines allows managers to select the most appropriate model based on public health targets. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Classification and regression trees; Pb; Random Forest; Soil; Spatial modeling; Urban","lead; accuracy assessment; classification; comparative study; concentration (composition); guideline; lead; model test; pollution monitoring; regression analysis; soil analysis; soil pollution; urban area; X-ray fluorescence; article; artificial intelligence; comparative study; demography; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; evaluation study; human; methodology; soil pollutant; spectrometry; statistical model; theoretical model; United States; Artificial Intelligence; Baltimore; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Lead; Linear Models; Maryland; Models, Theoretical; Residence Characteristics; Soil Pollutants; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Baltimore; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879785384

Readmission is usually the result of morbidity and may lead to death. The purpose of this study is to develop and compare statistical and genetic programming models to predict readmission. Patients were divided into separate Construction and Validation populations. Using 88 variables, logistic regression, genetic programs, and artificial neural nets were used to develop predictive models. Models were first constructed and tested on the Construction populations, then validated on the Validation population. Areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AU ROC) were used to compare the models. Two hundred and two patients (7.6 %) in the 2,644 patient Construction group and 216 (8.0 %) of the 2,711 patient Validation group were re-admitted within 30 days of CABG surgery. Logistic regression predicted readmission with AU ROC =.675 ±.021 in the Construction group. Genetic programs significantly improved the accuracy, AU ROC =.767 ±.001, p <.001). Artificial neural nets were less accurate with AU ROC = 0.597 ±.001 in the Construction group. Predictive accuracy of all three techniques fell in the Validation group. However, the accuracy of genetic programming (AU ROC =.654 ±.001) was still trivially but statistically non-significantly better than that of the logistic regression (AU ROC =.644 ±.020, p =.61).

Developed by Harvard Business School during the 1960 s, SWOT has been criticized on several grounds for being a top-down approach for gathering data; for creating a separation between those who think and those who do; for downplaying emergent strategies during the process of experimentation as opposed to intended strategies, and for neglecting anticipated future situations as opposed to current ones. In an attempt to remedy such weaknesses, this paper proposes two explorative frameworks similar to SWOT both in number of components and in utility. The first is PEAK where the components stand for: Power, Earnings, Artistry or Activity and Knowledge. The second is SETS where the components stand for: Solidity, Extent, Type and Segment or specialization. These two frameworks can be combined with SWOT and they can also be used separately in working with areas unrelated to SWOT. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

Forex market has been analysed using two isolated approaches, technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis attempts to predict the movement of prices by studying the historical data of the market whereas fundamental analysis concerns essentially with the overall state of the economy. Relying on one kind of analysis limits the quality of trading decisions therefore traders usually gain insight into the market by analysing many factors which may influence the market state and the price movement. This process has become increasingly challenging due to the vast and variant number of prices' determinants and the rapid changes in the market dynamics. This study proposes an event-driven business intelligence approach to respond immediately to any change in the market status by generating trading signals based on different analyses. Targeting the value associated with the data as it arrives, different models are built to capture and process the data of three currencies against US dollar in different frequency as well as the data of nine US macroeconomic indicators. The time-series data for both technical and fundamental indicators are modelled using artificial neural network while a knowledge base model is implemented to integrate the signals generated by time-series models. The experimental results show a remarkable improvement in the quality of trading signals using real-time consideration of different analyses. © 2013 Science Publications.","Event-driven approach; Forex market; Real-time business intelligence",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880171116

However, there is a risk of leaking new ideas by users who join a discussion to generate ideas. In order to avoid the risk, this study proposes a new workshop method to generate business ideas. In the workshop method, idea generators are required to discuss new business ideas based on information that is organized by users who do not join the discussion and thus never know new ideas that are created in this workshop. Idea generators who are given the user-organized information are considered to be able to create new ideas using the given information. We conducted an experiment to test this. In our experiment, participants were divided into two groups: the first group was asked to generate new business ideas based on the information with user perspective while the second group was asked to do so based on the information with engineer perspective. Performance of the first group was compared with that of the second group. Eight outside experts rated all ideas generated in terms of novelty, benefit and feasibility. The result showed that the ideas generated by the first group were rated significantly higher in terms of novelty as well as lower in terms of feasibility than the ideas generated by the second group. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey carried out to those who joined this workshop supported this finding. Our findings suggest that our workshop method is useful for bringing user perspective into actual business idea generation. © The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence 2013.","Business idea; Creativity; Future foresight; User innovation; Workshop","Artificial intelligence; Business idea; Creativity; Future foresight; User innovation; Workshop; Experiments",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940316868

The system predicted the removal date of the on-wing engines according to three types of factors affecting the service of the aircraft engine, which were performance, fault and time limit. The concept of damage baseline was proposed by considering the factors that the major fault of the aircraft core engine was always limited, and a damage propagation model based on linear degradation path was established to realize the removal date prediction based on hardware damage fault. This system was currently in service in Air China Limited, and was seamlessly integrated with the existing engine health management and maintenance decision support system via interfaces as a subsystem. The developed system obtained support data from its parent system and provided the prediction results for its parent system as support data. Thus an integrated process was formed including the engine condition monitoring process, the removal date prediction process and the maintenance decision-making process, which satisfied the MRO requirements of Air China Limited.","Civil aircraft engine; Linear degradation path; Maintance, repaire and operations; Prediction system; Removal date","Engine condition monitoring; Engine health managements; Linear degradation path; Maintance, repaire and operations; Maintenance , repair and operations; Maintenance decision making; Maintenance decision support system; Prediction systems; Artificial intelligence; Engines; Forecasting; Maintenance; Aircraft engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883229253

As one of the essential characteristics for CRN, the cognitive reconfiguration can meet the user requirements, realize interoperability between heterogeneous networks, make full use of radio resources and adapt to the time-varying environment to achieve the end-to-end requirements. However, the reconfiguration implementation is still challenging due to its need for complex environment cognition and multi-objects optimization. In this direction, ant colony optimization(ACO) technique, as an intelligent technology to solve the complex issues, is introduced to the appropriate model of the reconfiguration decision making process to achieve the adaption alternatives.

In today's complex and dynamic business environment, companies are often prevented from effectively and efficiently evaluating relevant factors necessary for developing their core capability strategic systems. These systems, with inherent human decision-making processes, should be fully considered when creating a method for determining a firm's suitable or required core capabilities. It is helpful to implement IT-based group decision support systems (GDSS) with soft computing algorithms to assist managers in determining the appropriate core capabilities for the firm. Therefore, this study develops a holistic group decision support system in which similarity measures, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy mathematics programming are implemented to facilitate managers in making decisions. Through evaluations done in actual cases, we have found that this system creates a flexible and user-friendly environment that aids top management and other relevant staff members in evaluating all relevant factors related to core capabilities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Core capability; Fuzzy mathematics programming; Similarity measure; Synergy analysis; Value chain","Core capabilities; Fuzzy mathematics; Similarity measure; Synergy analysis; Value chains; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Decision support systems; Fuzzy set theory; Management; Managers; Soft computing; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878964944

A network creation game is played by n players {1,2,...,n}, each identified with a vertex of a graph (network), where the strategy of player i, i=1,...,n, is to build some edges adjacent to i. The cost of building an edge is α>0, a fixed parameter of the game. The goal of every player is to minimize its creation cost plus its usage cost. The creation cost of player i is α times the number of built edges. In the SumGame variant, the usage cost of player i is the sum of distances from i to every node of the resulting graph. In the MaxGame variant, the usage cost is the eccentricity of i in the resulting graph of the game. In this paper we improve previously known bounds on the price of anarchy of the game (of both variants) for various ranges of α, and give new insights into the structure of equilibria for various values of α. The two main results of the paper show that for α>273{dot operator}n all equilibria in SumGame are trees and thus the price of anarchy is constant, and that for α>129 all equilibria in MaxGame are trees and the price of anarchy is constant. For SumGame this answers (almost completely) one of the fundamental open problems in the field-is price of anarchy of the network creation game constant for all values of α?-in an affirmative way, up to a tiny range of α. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Nash equilibrium; Network creation games; Price of anarchy","Dot operators; In networks; Nash equilibria; Network creation; Price of anarchy; Sum of distances; Artificial intelligence; Forestry; Graph theory; Costs; Artificial Intelligence; Costs; Forestry",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878478855

In this paper, we study from a formal perspective representations of multiset variables, and the consistency and propagation of constraints involving multiset variables. These help us model problems more naturally and can, for example, prevent introducing unnecessary symmetries into a model. We identify a number of different representations for multiset variables, compare them in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and propose inference rules to enforce bounds consistency for the representations. In addition, we propose to exploit the variety of a multiset - the number of distinct elements in it - to improve modeling expressiveness and further enhance constraint propagation. We derive a number of inference rules involving the varieties of multiset variables. The rules interact varieties with the traditional components of multiset variables (such as cardinalities) to obtain stronger propagation. We also demonstrate how to apply the rules to perform variety reasoning on some common multiset constraints. Experimental results show that performing variety reasoning on top of cardinality reasoning can effectively reduce more search space and achieve better runtime in solving some multiset CSPs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Constraint satisfaction; Multiset variables","Bounds consistency; Constraint propagation; Constraint Satisfaction; Distinct elements; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Inference rules; Modeling expressiveness; Multiset; Artificial intelligence; Constraint theory; Constraint satisfaction problems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877804381

But the studies have rarely examined the dynamic patterns of the IT value as measured by the firm's productive efficiency over time. The objective of this paper is to apply the three-factor constant elasticity of substitution (CES) time-varying stochastic production frontier models and use the same data set as used in several previous studies to investigate the dynamic patterns of IT value over time in connection with the issues of inputs substitution and complement and the productivity paradox. This paper adopts two analytical skills, collective and individual, to analyze the empirical results. Collectively, we find that the dynamic patterns of IT value are closely related to the substitution and complement of three inputs and the IT productivity paradox. Individually, we identify five common dynamic patterns of the IT value measured by productive efficiency and interpret their implications for the productivity paradox as summarized in a two by two matrix of practical applications and strategies. This matrix accounts for four different scenarios of the relationship between the average productive efficiency and the IT productivity paradox, illustrates some practical applications by the analytical results, and provides some business insights and managerial strategies for IT decision makers and PO/IS managers. This represents a new contribution to the understanding of the dynamic influence of IT investments upon the value of IT over time. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, this virtual process is harder to manage and use efficiently than traditional learning. This is because of the complexity of e-learning software and the amount of available data, which has outgrown human expectations and processing capabilities. Fortunately, there is a solution: many dimensions of e-learning can be supported by artificial intelligence (AI). In this article we investigate the use of AI in e-learning and analyze particular AI applications, considering their educational as well as business effects. The domain of e-learning is very broad, but its elements might be ordered by their practical importance and the ratios of profits to costs of AI-oriented investments.

Group in order to enhance its SAP information system with a custom-made application for production-scheduling optimization. The goal of the optimization is to find a production schedule that satisfies different, contradictory production and business constraints. We show the challenges faced in the application of the multi-objective optimization approach, which is gaining influence in the management of production scheduling. We implement a memetic version of the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm with customized reproduction operators and local search procedures to find a set of feasible, non-dominated solutions. Such a memetic algorithm was applied to two real order lists from the production company. Additionally, we also lay out an efficient presentation of the multi-objective results for an expert's support in decision making. This provides the management with the possibility to gain additional insights into how the production schedule dynamically reacts to changes in the decision criteria. We show that the multi-objective approach is able to find high-quality solutions, which enables flexibility when it comes to quickly adapting to specific business conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this direction, the IEEE802.16 has defined wireless access systems called WiMAX. These systems provide high-speed communications over a long distance. For this purpose some service classes with QoS requirements are defined; but the QoS scheduler is not standardized in IEEE802.16. The scheduling mechanism has a significant effect on the performance of WiMAX systems for use of bandwidth and radio resources. Some scheduling algorithms have been introduced by researchers; but they only provide some limited aspects of QoS. An intelligent decision support system is therefore necessary for scheduling. In this paper a fuzzy based scheduling system is proposed for compounds of real-time and non-real-time polling services which provide QoS requirements and fairness in dynamic conditions. A series of simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm in terms of latency and throughput QoS parameters.

In an attempt to overcome this issue, epoxies incorporating a combination of nanoclay (used for nano-reinforcement) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS, used as the thermoplastic phase) were synthesized and tested in this work. The tensile, flexural, compressive, and impact strengths of these materials were evaluated. Various factors can influence these properties of hybrid nanocomposites during the preparation of such materials, so an artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to determine the effects of the clay, HIPS, and hardener loadings on the mechanical properties of the epoxy/HIPS/nanoclay nanocomposites and to develop models for predicting their mechanical behavior. A genetic algorithm (GA), a powerful optimization method, was employed to determine a fitness function that could calculate the optimum values of these mechanical properties. The results obtained indicated that the new ternary nanocomposites possess tensile, compressive, and impact strengths were improved up to 60 %, 64 %, and 402 %, respectively higher than those of the neat resin, although they did not show enhanced flexural strength. The tensile, flexural, and copmressive elongations at break were improved up to 53%, 38%, and 27% greater than those of neat epoxy, respectively. In addition, the fracture surface morphologies of the ternary nanocomposites were investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

The use of this system is demonstrated with an example from Dulce Stream Basin (1,000 km2 encompassing 27 subwatersheds), which has high level of agricultural activities and extensive available data regarding aquifer geology. In the logic model, aquifer pollution hazard is assessed as a function of two primary topics: groundwater and soil conditions. This logic model shows the state of each evaluated landscape with respect to aquifer pollution hazard based mainly on the parameters of the DRASTIC and GOD models. The decision model allows prioritizing subwatersheds for groundwater resources management according to three main criteria including farming activities, agrochemical application, and irrigation use. Stakeholder participation, through interviews, in combination with expert judgment was used to select and weight each criterion. The resulting subwatershed priority map, by combining the logic and decision models, allowed identifying five subwatersheds in the upper and middle basin as the main aquifer protection areas. The results reasonably fit the natural conditions of the basin, identifying those subwatersheds with shallow water depth, loam-loam silt texture soil media and pasture land cover in the middle basin, and others with intensive agricultural activity, coinciding with the natural recharge area to the aquifer system. Major difficulties and some recommendations of applying this methodology in real-world situations are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aquifer pollution hazard; Decision support system; Management areas; Subwatershed priority","Agricultural activities; Agrochemical application; Decision support models; Groundwater resources management; Management areas; Pollution hazards; Stakeholder participation; Subwatershed priority; Agriculture; Aquifers; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Geologic models; Groundwater resources; Hazards; Pollution; Groundwater pollution; ground water; aquifer pollution; basin; decision support system; groundwater resource; recharge; stakeholder; stream; water depth; water management; watershed; Argentina; article; decision support system; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; geographic distribution; irrigation (agriculture); loam soil; pollution monitoring; resource management; soil analysis; soil texture; strategic planning; system analysis; water analysis; water management; watershed; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Support Techniques; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Risk Assessment; Water Pollutants; Water Pollution; Water Supply; Argentina; Pampas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879064867

Monitoring of heart rate variability has been advocated as a potential means to monitor the rapid changes in the physiological state of hemorrhaging patients, with the most popular methods involving calculation of the R-R interval signal's power spectral density (PSD) or use of fractal dimensions (FD). However, the latter method poses technical challenges, while the former is best suited to stationary signals rather than the non-stationary R-R interval. Both approaches are also limited by high inter- and intra-individual variability, a serious issue when applying these indices to the clinical setting. We propose an approach which applies the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the R-R interval signal to extract information at both 500 and 125 Hz sampling rates. The utility of machine learning models based on these features were tested in assessing electrocardiogram signals from volunteers subjected to lower body negative pressure induced central hypovolemia as a surrogate of hemorrhage. These machine learning models based on DWT features were compared against those based on the traditional PSD and FD, at both sampling rates and their performance was evaluated based on leave-one-subject- out fold cross-validation. Results demonstrate that the proposed DWT-based model outperforms individual PSD and FD methods as well as the combination of these two traditional methods at both sample rates of 500 Hz (p value <0.0001) and 125 Hz (p value <0.0001) in detecting the degree of hypovolemia. These findings indicate the potential of the proposed DWT approach in monitoring the physiological changes caused by hemorrhage. The speed and relatively low computational costs in deriving these features may make it particularly suited for implementation in portable devices for remote monitoring. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Discrete wavelet transformation; Heart rate variability (HRV); Higuchi fractal dimension; Lower body negative pressure (LBNP); Power spectral density; RR interval","Discrete wavelet transformation; Heart rate variability; Higuchi fractal dimension; Negative pressures; RR intervals; Finite difference method; Fractal dimension; Heart; Learning systems; Patient treatment; Physiology; Power spectral density; Signal detection; Discrete wavelet transforms; article; calculation; controlled study; discrete wavelet transform; disease severity; electrocardiogram; fractal analysis; heart rate variability; human; hypovolemia; intermethod comparison; lower body negative pressure; major clinical study; mathematical computing; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; power spectral density; priority journal; signal processing; Algorithms; Analysis of Variance; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; Fractals; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypovolemia; Lower Body Negative Pressure; Monitoring, Physiologic; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Wavelet Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878324123

We describe a system to automatically detect such gaps in NIBP measurement and notify clinicians in real-time to initiate measurement. We applied a decision support system called the Smart Anesthesia Messenger (SAM) to notify the anesthesia provider if NIBP measurements have not been made in the last 7 min. Notification messages were generated only if direct arterial blood pressure was not being monitored. NIBP gaps were analyzed for 9 months before and after SAM notification was initiated (12,000 cases for each period). SAM notification was able to reduce the occurrence of extended NIBP gaps >15 min from 15.7 ± 4.5 to 6.7 ± 2.0 instances per 1,000 cases (p < 0.001). In addition, for extended gaps (>15 min) the mean gap duration declined from 23.1 ± 2.0 to 18.6 ± 1.1 min after SAM notification was initiated (p < 0.001). However, for 7-15 min gaps, SAM notification was not effective in reducing the occurrence. The maximum gap encountered before SAM was 64 min, while it was 27 min with SAM notification. Real-time notification using SAM is an effective way to reduce both the number of instances and the duration of inadvertent, extended (>15 min) gaps in blood pressure measurements in the operating room. However, the frequency of gaps <15 min could not be reduced using the current configuration of SAM. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Anesthesia information management system; Blood pressure monitoring; Decision support; Patient monitoring; Real-time reminders","Arterial blood pressure; Blood-pressure monitoring; Current configuration; Decision supports; Extended gap; Information management systems; Measurements of; Real-time reminders; Anesthesiology; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Information management; Patient monitoring; Blood pressure; arterial pressure; article; blood pressure cuff; blood pressure measurement; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; decision support system; human; major clinical study; non invasive blood pressure monitor; operating room; patient care; patient monitoring; priority journal; Anesthesia; Blood Pressure Determination; Computer Systems; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Monitoring, Intraoperative",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878323282

However, CCA needs that the samples of the two views are fully-paired. Actually, we are often faced up with the semi-paired scenario where the number of available paired samples is limited and yet the number of unpaired samples is sufficient. For such a scenario, CCA is generally prone to overfitting and thus performs poorly, since its definition itself makes it only able to utilize those paired samples. To overcome such a shortcoming, several semi-paired variants of CCA have been proposed. However, unpaired samples in these methods are just used in the way of single-view leaning to capture individual views' structure information for regularizing CCA. Intuitively, using unpaired samples in the way of two-view learning should be more natural and more attractive since CCA itself is a two-view learning method. As a result, a novel CCAs semi-paired variant named Neighborhood Correlation Analysis (NeCA), which uses unpaired samples in the two-view learning way, is developed through incorporating between-view neighborhood relationships into CCA. The relationships are acquired through leveraging within-view neighborhood relationships of each view's all data (including paired and unpaired data) and between-view paired information. Thus, it can take more sufficient advantage of the unpaired samples and then mitigate overfitting effectively caused by the limited paired data. Promising experiments results on several popular multi-view datasets show its feasibility and effectiveness. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Canonical correlation analysis; Neighborhood correlation; Neighborhood relationship; Semi-paired learning; Two-view learning","Canonical correlation analysis; Correlation analysis; Learning methods; Neighborhood relationship; Paired sample; Semi-paired learning; Structure information; Two views; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Correlation methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878155920

In most of the published papers, Pareto fronts are provided, and in the best cases they are compared to the tradeoff fronts obtained using other classical metaheuristics, but in a very subjective way. In this paper we present a comparison that deals with the multi-objective optimal design of analog circuits via the SI technique and other famous metaheuristics.

We propose reducing the size of Apriori rule sets by removing overlapping rules, and compare this approach with two standard methods for reducing rule set size: increasing the minimum confidence parameter, and increasing the minimum antecedent support parameter. We evaluate the rule sets in terms of confidence and coverage, as well as two rule interestingness measures that favour rules with antecedent conditions that are poor individual predictors of the target class, as we assume that these represent potentially interesting rules. We also examine the distribution of the rules graphically, to assess whether particular classes of rules are eliminated. We show that removing overlapping rules substantially reduces rule set size in most cases, and alters the character of a rule set less than if the standard parameters are used to constrain the rule set to the same size.

This article proposes a CE framework based on application of information technology and object-oriented methodology for lean manufacturing. This approach expected to give manufacturing companies an extra edge in today's competitive market. A case study is presented in this article to demonstrate the effectiveness of CE framework in a machine tool manufacturing company. CE practice was adopted for new products, to align the systems and processes of the company.

Downscaling is a very important process to convert a coarse domain satellite data to a finer spatial resolution. Three artificial intelligence techniques along with the generalized linear model (GLM) are used to improve the spatial resolution of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) derived soil moisture, which is currently available at a very coarse scale of ~40 Km. Artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine, relevance vector machine and generalized linear models are chosen for this study to integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) with the SMOS derived soil moisture. Soil moisture deficit (SMD) derived from a hydrological model called PDM (Probability Distribution Model) is used for the downscaling performance evaluation. The statistical evaluation has also been made with the day-time and night-time MODIS LST differences with the mean day and night-time PDM SMD data for the selection of effective MODIS products. The accuracy and robustness of all the downscaling algorithms are discussed in terms of their assumptions and applicability. The statistical performance indices such as R2, %Bias and RMSE indicates that the ANN (R2 = 0. 751, %Bias = -0. 628 and RMSE = 0. 011), RVM (R2 = 0. 691, %Bias = 1. 009 and RMSE = 0. 013), SVM (R2 = 0. 698, %Bias = 2. 370 and RMSE = 0. 013) and GLM (R2 = 0. 698, %Bias = 1. 009 and RMSE = 0. 013) algorithms on the whole are relatively more skillful to downscale the variability of the soil moisture in comparison to the non-downscaled data (R2 = 0. 418 and RMSE = 0. 017) with the outperformance of ANN algorithm. The other attempts related to growing and non-growing seasons have been used in this study to reveal that season based downscaling is even better than continuous time series with fairly high performance statistics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; Generalized linear models; Relevance vector machine; SMOS; Soil moisture; Soil moisture deficit; Support vector machine","Artificial intelligence; Atmospheric temperature; Continuous time systems; Image resolution; Land surface temperature; Learning systems; Maximum likelihood; Neural networks; Radiometers; Satellites; Scheduling; Soil surveys; Support vector machines; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Time series; Vectors; Artificial intelligence techniques; Generalized linear model; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Probability distribution model; Relevance Vector Machine; SMOS; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Soil moisture deficits; Soil moisture; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; downscaling; hydrological modeling; modeling; MODIS; satellite data; SMOS; soil moisture; spatial resolution; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876952993

Single algorithm cannot be widely accepted as suitable method for mining of gene expression data. Therefore, integration of different algorithms and extraction of more useful information from the expression data are the key problems for identification of biomarkers. Here, we used three machine learning algorithms to select feature genes based on gene profiling data of gastric cancer (GC). Then, a common divisor was extracted as candidate feature genes aggregation for Tree Building and Tree Pruning analysis by Decision Tree (DT) algorithm. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were used to validate the relative expression levels of the candidate feature genes. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyse the classification sensitivity and specificity of the feature genes. A total of 174, 202, 149 feature genes were selected by Class Information Index, Information Gain Index and Relief algorithms, with a common divisor consisting of 32 genes. Using a DT algorithm to contribute to the classification rule sets, we identified COL2A1 and ATP4B as candidate biomarkers of GC.

Taking into account opportunistic agents and the resulting information asymmetry we propose a general decentralized negotiation approach which uses ideas from ant colony optimization. In the course of the negotiation the agents iteratively vote on proposed project schedules without disclosing preference information regarding cash flow values.

To this end we define a rule-based procedural semantics for a relevant fragment of BPMN, a very popular graphical notation for specifying business processes. Our semantics defines a state transition system by following an approach similar to the Fluent Calculus, and allows us to specify state change in terms of preconditions and effects of the enactment of activities. Then we show how the procedural process knowledge can be seamlessly integrated with the domain knowledge specified by using the OWL-RL rule-based ontology language. Our framework provides a wide range of reasoning services by using standard logic programming inference engines. In particular, we can perform very sophisticated reasoning tasks by combining both procedural and domain dependent knowledge. A preliminary implementation shows that our approach is effective in practice.","Business processes; Ontologies; Rule-based reasoning; Verification","Behavioral reasoning; Business Process; Graphical notation; Ontology language; Procedural semantics; Process knowledge; Rule based reasoning; State transition systems; Artificial intelligence; Logic programming; Ontology; Verification; Semantics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877940702

The intents of the planning that provide the means for evaluating schedules and making business-oriented decisions are missing during the visualization. Yet, 4D visualization has focused mainly on the visual detection of conflicts in time and space. This project proposes an approach to extend 4D visualization into a level we call perception, with the aim to support the decision-making process of a construction company during the phase of planning and execution. By gathering and then reproducing planning intents during the visualization of a large-scale building construction schedule, the application of our approach eases and accelerates the ability to comprehend a construction schedule. It also communicates planning intents among the project practitioners. A modeling tool and a simulation tool are utilized in order to acquire valid planning details. In this paper, our perception model that builds on a 4D model is presented. Then, the types and the sources of the planning intents, as well as a prototype implementation and an example, are described.","4D visualization; Building construction planning; Decision support systems; Perception model","4D visualization; Building construction; Construction companies; Construction schedules; Decision making process; Perception model; Planning and execution; Prototype implementations; Artificial intelligence; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Construction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876871597

The basic idea is to prioritize the efforts of human resource practitioners to focus on candidates that are likely of high quality, that are likely to accept a job offer if made one, and that are likely to remain with the organization for the long term. To do so, the system first individually ranks candidates along several dimensions using a keyword matching algorithm and several bipartite ranking algorithms with univariate loss trained on historical actions. Next, individual rankings are aggregated to derive a single list that is presented to the recruitment team through an interactive portal. The portal supports multiple filters that facilitate effective identification of candidates. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system on data collected from a large organization over several years with business value metrics showing greater hiring yield with less interviews. Similarly, using historical pre-hire data we demonstrate accurate identification of candidates that will have quickly left the organization.

We show how a dialogue interface of argument from expert opinion, along with its set of critical questions, provides the argumentation component of the ESE. It enables internal scientific knowledge to be translated over into a wider arena in which individual nonexpert citizens and groups can make use of it.

In recent years, the development of marketing management support systems has paralleled this evolution in informational problems faced by managers, leading to a growth in the study (and use) of artificial intelligence and soft computing methodologies. Here, we present and implement a novel intelligent system that incorporates fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms to operate in an unsupervised manner. This approach allows the discovery of interesting association rules, which can be linguistically interpreted, in large scale databases (KDD or Knowledge Discovery in Databases.) We then demonstrate its application to a distribution channel problem. It is shown how the proposed system is able to return a number of novel and potentially-interesting associations among variables.

More specifically, we apply a new hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to design an optimal industrial product line. PSO is a biologically-inspired optimization framework derived from natural intelligence that exploits simple analogues of collective behavior found in nature, such as bird flocking and fish schooling. All existing product line optimization algorithms in the literature have been so far applied to consumer markets and product attributes that range across some discrete values. Our hybrid PSO algorithm searches for an optimal product line in a large design space which consists of both discrete and continuous design variables. The incorporation of a mutation operator to the standard PSO algorithm significantly improves its performance and enables our mechanism to outperform the state of the art Genetic Algorithm in a simulated study with artificial datasets pertaining to industrial cranes. The proposed approach deals with the problem of handling variables that can take any value from a continuous range and utilizes design variables associated with both product attributes and value-added services. The application of the proposed artificial intelligence framework yields important implications for strategic customer relationship and production management in business-to-business markets. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Business-to-business marketing; Hybridization; Mutation operator; Particle swarm optimization; Product line design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878505117

This study presents machine learning techniques to develop models to predict AMD quality using historical monitoring data of a mine site. The machine learning techniques explored in this study include artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine with polynomial (SVM-Poly) and radial base function (SVM-RBF) kernels, model tree (M5P), and K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). Input variables (physico-chemical parameters) that influence drainage dynamics are identified and used to develop models to predict copper concentrations. For these selected techniques, the predictive accuracy and uncertainty were evaluated based on different statistical measures. The results showed that SVM-Poly performed best, followed by the SVM-RBF, ANN, M5P, and KNN techniques. Overall, this study demonstrates that the machine learning techniques are promising tools for predicting AMD quality. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acid mine drainage; Acid rock drainage; Artificial neural network; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning; Model tree; Support vector machine","Acid mine drainage; Acid rock drainage; Copper concentration; Environmental implications; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning techniques; Model trees; Physicochemical parameters; Copper; Forecasting; Forestry; Learning systems; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Support vector machines; copper; copper; acid mine drainage; artificial neural network; comparative study; concentration (composition); copper; decision making; geostatistics; numerical model; physicochemical property; prediction; accuracy; acid mine drainage; article; artificial neural network; controlled study; intermethod comparison; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; model tree; physical chemistry; pollution monitoring; statistical analysis; support vector machine; support vector machine with polynomial; support vector machine with radial base function; uncertainty; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; comparative study; environmental monitoring; methodology; mining; statistics; water pollutant; water pollution; Algorithms; Copper; Drainage; Forestry; Neural Networks; Artificial Intelligence; Copper; Environmental Monitoring; Mining; Neural Networks (Computer); Support Vector Machines; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878373106

The proposed method is based on the modified prioritized kinematic control, which allows smooth and continuous transition between priorities. This, as long as the selected criterion is met, allows arbitrary joint movement of a robot without any regard of the consequential movement of the ZMP. On the other hand, it constrains the movement when the criterion approaches a critical condition. The critical condition thus triggers a reflexive, subconscious behavior, which has a higher priority than the desired, conscious movement. The transition between the two is smooth and reversible. Furthermore, the switching is encapsulated in a single modified prioritized task control equation. We demonstrate the properties of the algorithm on two human-inspired robots developed in our laboratory; a human-inspired leg-robot used for imitating human movement and a skiing robot. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Humanoids; Skiing robot; Stability","Continuous transitions; Control framework; Critical condition; Human movements; Humanoids; Joint movement; Kinematic control; Stability control; Artificial intelligence; Convergence of numerical methods; Robots; Anthropomorphic robots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877812052

Many physical and cognitive abilities in the 'animal kingdom' are only acquired (to a given degree) when the subject reaches a certain stage of development, which can be accelerated or spoilt depending on how the environment, training or education is. The term 'potential ability' usually refers to how quick and likely the process of attaining the ability is. In principle, things should not be different for the 'machine kingdom'. While machines can be characterised by a set of cognitive abilities, and measuring them is already a big challenge, known as 'universal psychometrics', a more informative, and yet more challenging, goal would be to also determine the potential cognitive abilities of a machine. In this paper we investigate the notion of potential cognitive ability for machines, focussing especially on universality and intelligence. We consider several machine characterisations (non-interactive and interactive) and give definitions for each case, considering permanent and temporal potentials. From these definitions, we analyse the relation between some potential abilities, we bring out the dependency on the environment distribution and we suggest some ideas about how potential abilities can be measured. Finally, we also analyse the potential of environments at different levels and briefly discuss whether machines should be designed to be intelligent or potentially intelligent. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","(Universal) Psychometrics; (Universal) Turing machines; Cognitive abilities; Machine intelligence measurement; Potential intelligence; Universality probability","(Universal) Psychometrics; Animal kingdom; Cognitive ability; Machine intelligence; On potentials; Or educations; Potential ability; Potential intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Turing machines",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877750850

It notably allows to align business processes and supporting IT solutions at best, to produce a documentation of the company's ""savoir-faire"" and to look for possible optimizations. The business modeling discipline of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) has enriched the semantic of the Unified Modeling Language's (UML) use case diagrams for the special purpose of representing the organization's processes with accurate elements. [Question/Problem] RUP/UML business use case scemantics are nevetheless only intended to further stereotype use case models and not to be used for reasoning. In parallel and in line with artificial intelligence concepts, researchers have developed the i* framework enabling the evaluation and decomposition of multiple design opportunities. RUP/UML business use case scemantics could be used more efficiently to integrate the latter benefits. [Principal ideas/results] Through a systematic mapping of elements from i* on the one side and of the RUP/UML business use case model on the other, we have set up a RUP/UML graphical notation for i* elements. Applicability has been shown on an illustrative example. [Contribution] The main contribution of the framework is allowing to model in an i* fashion using CASE-tools meant for RUP/UML and proposing an interface for forward engineering the produced model in a classical UML requirements model.

We try to face such a situation by proposing a predictive-clustering approach, where different context-related execution scenarios are equipped with separate prediction models. Recent methods for the discovery of both Predictive Clustering Trees and state-aware process performance predictors can be reused in the approach, provided that the input log is preliminary converted into a suitable propositional form, based on the identification of an optimal subset of features for log traces. In order to make the approach more robust and parameter free, we also introduce an ensemble-based clustering method, where multiple PCTs are learnt (using different, randomly selected, subsets of features), and integrated into an overall model. Several tests on real-life logs confirmed the validity of the approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Clustering; Ensemble Learning; Prediction; Process Mining","Clustering; Clustering methods; Ensemble learning; Execution scenario; Predictive clustering trees; Predictive models; Process mining; Process performance; Forecasting; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875834168

As most decisions today are based on data collected by Information Systems (IS), the IS itself must become more adaptable. This is particularly challenging in the domain of Business Intelligence (BI) Systems since the underlying architectural approach of enterprise-wide decision support systems is not build upon agility, but on reliability and robustness over a period of time. In order to determine the agility of BI, a unique understanding of agility and its underlying criteria is required. This paper provides a literature review which aims to summarize the known criteria from IS literature that can be applied to the domain of BI. The results can be interpreted as a framework for understanding the agility of BI systems and form the basis for generating mandatory criteria for assessing agility. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Architectural approach; Business intelligence systems; Literature reviews; Reliability and robustness; Strategic advantages; Turbulent environments; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Systems science; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875543915

A typical voxelwise analysis treats measurements at each voxel (e.g. fractional anisotropy, gray matter probability) as outcome measures to study the effects of possible explanatory variables (e.g. age, group) in a linear regression setting. Furthermore, each voxel is treated independently until the stage of correction for multiple comparisons. Recently, multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPA), such as classification, have arisen as an alternative to VBM. The main advantage of MVPA over VBM is that the former employ multivariate methods which can account for interactions among voxels in identifying significant patterns. They also provide ways for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis at individual subject level. However, compared to VBM, the results of MVPA are often more difficult to interpret and prone to arbitrary conclusions. In this paper, first we use penalized likelihood modeling to provide a unified framework for understanding both VBM and MVPA. We then utilize statistical learning theory to provide practical methods for interpreting the results of MVPA beyond commonly used performance metrics, such as leave-one-out-cross validation accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, we demonstrate that there are challenges in MVPA when trying to obtain image phenotyping information in the form of statistical parametric maps (SPMs), which are commonly obtained from VBM, and provide a bootstrap strategy as a potential solution for generating SPMs using MVPA. This technique also allows us to maximize the use of available training data. We illustrate the empirical performance of the proposed framework using two different neuroimaging studies that pose different levels of challenge for classification using MVPA. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification; Generalization risk; Image phenotyping; Linear models; Multi-Voxel pattern analysis; Penalized likelihood; Regression; Voxel based morphometry","adolescent; adult; article; artificial intelligence; autism; biological model; brain; brain mapping; child; diffusion weighted imaging; female; histology; human; image processing; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; myelinated nerve; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; phenotype; physiology; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; Adolescent; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Neurological; Negotiating; Nerve Fibers, Myelinated; Neuroimaging; Phenotype; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Young Adult",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880572634

Optimization of the product development process requires different product variant information at the early stage of product development. At the early designing stage, designers lack sufficient product information and have difficulty in determining it. The idea of the paper is to provide measurable engineering information for the quality function deployment method. For this purpose, a chosen artificial intelligence method was used. In the experiment, artificial neural network (NN) was applied. The results of analyses show that the intelligent estimation methods are useful and effective.

Here we present a novel, principled approach to resolve the remained problems of substitution technique of audio Steganography. We use most powerful encryption algorithm (RSA) to encrypt message in the first level of security, which is very complex to break. In the second level, we use a more powerful GA based LSB (Least Significant Bit) Algorithm to encode the encrypted message into audio data. Here encrypted message bits are embedded into random and higher LSB layers, resulting in increased robustness against noise addition. The robustness specially would be increased against those intentional attacks which try to reveal the hidden message and also some unintentional attacks like noise addition as well. On the other hand, to reduce the distortion, GA operators are used. The basic idea behind this paper is maintained randomness in message bit insertion into audio data for hiding the data from hackers and multi-objective GA is used to reduce distortion. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial intelligence; Audio steganography; Data hiding; Genetic algorithm; Substitution techniques","Audio steganography; Data hiding; Encryption algorithms; Internet communities; Least significant bits; Robustness against noise; Secure data transfer; Substitution techniques; Acoustic noise; Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Data transfer; Personal computing; Steganography; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879991755

Prolonging the time interval before the death of the first sensor node, viz. the stability period, is critical for many applications where the feedback from the WSN must be reliable. Although Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and LEACH-like protocols are fundamental and popular clustering protocols to manage the system's energy and thus to prolong the lifespan of the network, they assume a near to a perfect energy homogeneous system where a node failure, drainage and re-energizing are typically not considered. More recent protocols like Stable Election Protocol (SEP) considers the reverse, i.e.; energy heterogeneity, and properly utilizes the extra energy to guarantee a stable and reliable performance of the network system. While paradigms of computational intelligence such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years to address various WSN's challenges such as nodes deployment and localization, data fusion and aggregation, security and routing, they did not (to the best of our knowledge) explore the possibility of maintaining heterogeneous-aware energy consumption to guarantee a reliable and robust routing protocol design. By this, a new protocol named stable-aware evolutionary routing protocol (SAERP), is proposed in this paper to ensure maximum stability and minimum instability periods for both homogeneous/heterogeneous WSNs. SAERP introduces an evolutionary modeling, where the cluster head election probability becomes more efficient, to well maintain balanced energy consumption in both energy homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. The performance of SAERP over simulation for 90 WSNs is evaluated and compared to well known LEACH and SEP protocols. We found that SAERP is more robust and always ensures longer stability period and shorter instability period. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Clustering; Evolutionary algorithm; Meta-heuristic; Routing protocol; Stable-aware; Wireless sensor networks","Balanced energy consumption; Clustering; Evolutionary algorithms (EAs); Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchies (LEACH); Metaheuristic; Reliable routing protocols; Stable-aware; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Artificial intelligence; Data fusion; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Leaching; Routing protocols; Stability; Wireless sensor networks; Sensor nodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879687981

We propose to utilize a graph structure (called a profile graph) which is constructed via the profile data, and propose a simple model to utilize both the observed connectivity relation and the profile graph. Furthermore, instead of a hierarchical approach, based on the modularity matrix of the network structure, we propose an embedding approach which utilizes the regularization via the profile graph.

Taking advantages of contract supplier and spot market, the buyer can better meet business requirements in this dynamic business environment. However, there are limitations of existing methods for modeling multiple correlated risks to support decision makers for allocating orders among multiple suppliers in the presence of spot market. Therefore, Monte Carlo simulation algorithm termed as Expected Profit-Supply at Risk (A-EPSaR) is proposed to quantify each supplier's risk so as to let decision maker realize the trade-off between profit and risk. The goal programming model helps to allocate orders among the supplier pool and the contract-spot allocation model can assign orders between the spot market and the supplier pool, respectively. The significance of this paper is to propose a novel decision support framework which helps the buyer to make optimal and robust procurement decision including supplier selection and order allocation among multiple supplier sources in the existence of correlated demand, yield and spot price uncertainties.

Methods: Using public sources, we have assembled and curated the largest, to our knowledge, human intestinal transporter database (>5,000 interaction entries for >3,700 molecules). This data was used to develop thoroughly validated classification Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models of transport and/or inhibition of several major transporters including MDR1, BCRP, MRP1-4, PEPT1, ASBT, OATP2B1, OCT1, and MCT1. Results: QSAR models have been developed with advanced machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and k Nearest Neighbors using Dragon and MOE chemical descriptors. These models afforded high external prediction accuracies of 71-100% estimated by 5-fold external validation, and showed hit retrieval rates with up to 20-fold enrichment in the virtual screening of DrugBank compounds. Conclusions: The compendium of predictive QSAR models developed in this study can be used for virtual profiling of drug candidates and/or environmental agents with the optimal transporter profiles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","ADMET; drug transport; efflux; membrane transport proteins; permeability","apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter; breast cancer resistance protein; carrier protein; monocarboxylate transporter 1; multidrug resistance protein 1; multidrug resistance protein 2; multidrug resistance protein 3; multidrug resistance protein 4; organic anion transporter 2; organic anion transporter 2B; organic cation transporter 1; peptide transporter 1; unclassified drug; accuracy; article; controlled study; drug interaction; drug transport; drug uptake; human; Human Intestinal Transporter Database; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; prediction; priority journal; protein database; quantitative structure activity relation; random forest; support vector machine; validation study; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Transport, Active; Computer Simulation; Databases, Pharmaceutical; Databases, Protein; Humans; Intestines; Membrane Transport Proteins; Models, Biological; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacokinetics; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876473356

We employ both Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Neural Network (NN) as two different schemes of the AI. The developed tools are intended to help to select the proper combination of engine thrust, wing area and the aircraft weight without going through elaborate details of other direct approaches. We further show how the AI could be applied to the specific class of light business jets which serves to validate these schemes. The results indicate the effectiveness of the AI approach in the preliminary aircraft design process. The actual and approximated values for the take-off wing loading and the take-off thrust loading are in agreement within ten percent.

This species grows in some microclimates, namely in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The results obtained demonstrate that A. ponderosa mushrooms showed different inorganic composition according to their habitat and the molecular data, obtained by M13-PCR, allowed to distinguish the mushrooms at species level and to differentiate the A. ponderosa strains according to their location. Taking into account, on the one hand, that the characterisation of different strains is essential in further commercialisation and certification process and, on the other hand, the molecular studies are quite time consuming and an expensive process, the development of formal models to predict the molecular profile based on inorganic composition comes to be something essential. In the present work, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to solve this problem. The ANN selected to predict molecular profile based on inorganic composition has a 6-7-14 topology. A good match between the observed and predicted values was observed.

It describes the design and development of a DSS now known as supply chain environmental analysis tool (SCEnAT) in detail, putting its unique and innovative features into a comparative perspective vis-à-vis existing tools and software of different types. The methodological framework used to design and develop SCEnAT integrates different individual techniques/methods of supply chain (SC) mapping, SC carbon accounting, SC interventions and SC interventions evaluation on a range of key performance indicators (KPIs). These individual methods have been used and applied innovatively to the challenge of designing SCEnAT within the desired framework. Finally, we demonstrate the application of SCEnAT, especially the advantage of using a robust carbon accounting methodology, to a SC case study. The SCEnAT framework pushes the theoretical boundary by addressing the problems of intra-organisational approach in decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain; with an open innovation, cutting edge, hybridised framework that considers the supply chain as a whole in co-decision making for lowering carbon along the supply chain with the most robust methodology of hybrid life cycle analysis (LCA) that considers direct and indirect emissions and interventional performance evaluation for low carbon technology investment and business case building in order to adapt and mitigate climate change problems.

The model proposed supports the enterprises in the decisions to participate or exit in a network of enterprises. The model is based on the definition of a set of rules that operate with local information to take the decisions. The local information is the output of the collaboration process; this means that the approach proposed integrates the collaboration methodology and the decision model.

During disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the tsunami in Japan people used social media to report injuries as well as send out their requests. During social movements such as Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and the Arab Spring, people extensively used social media to organize their events and spread the news. As more people rely on social media for political, social, and business events, it is more susceptible to become a place for evildoers to use it to spread misinformation and rumors. Therefore, users have the challenge to discern which piece of information is credible or not. They also need to find ways to assess the credibility of information. This problem becomes more important when the source of the information is not known to the consumer. In this paper we propose a method to measure user credibility in social media. We study the situations in which we cannot assess the credibility of the content or the credibility of the user (source of the information) based on the user's profile.

Within this ambit, the literature review shows a lack of uniformity in the terms used to define the phases or components of a procurement process as well as in the election of the critical variables used to select the most suitable supplier. Furthermore, this literature shows a wide variety of individual and integrated methodologies that have been developed so far in an attempt to optimise such a selection. This work proposes a new suppliers' evaluation-and-selection model. The model homogenises the terminology involved in such processes and fulfils three main goals. First, it allows the joint assessment and comparison among new and historical suppliers, identifying the key evaluation factors in each case. Second, it allows the inherent knowledge about evaluation to be flexibly adapted to the type of product to be purchased-in this paper ""basic products""- according to Kraljic's terminology (a major issue in procurement management and not taken into account by any of the models proposed so far). Finally, a FDSS is proposed to make the model operational. The proposed method is robust enough to improve the main shortcomings of more simplistic methods (e.g. those based on weights) and eases the comprehension of the embedded knowledge within the supplier evaluation processes.

Four different scale factor schemes are proposed, tested, compared and analyzed. Two schemes simply employ multiple scale factor values and two also include an update logic during the evolution. The four schemes have been integrated for comparison within three recently proposed distributed Differential Evolution structures and tested on several various test problems. The results are then compared to those of a previous study where the so-called binomial crossover was employed. Numerical results show that, when associated to the exponential crossover, the employment of multiple scale factors is not systematically beneficial and in some cases even detrimental to the performance of the algorithm. The exponential crossover accentuates the exploitative character of the Differential Evolution, which cannot always be counterbalanced by the increase in the explorative aspect of the algorithm introduced by the employment of multiple scale factor values. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Differential evolution; Distributed algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Scale factor","Different scale; Differential Evolution; Multiple scale factors; Numerical results; Scale Factor; Test problem; Artificial intelligence; Parallel algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876157565

Ants deposit pheromone on paths they take, preferring paths that have more pheromone on them. Since shorter paths are traversed faster, more pheromone accumulates on them in a given time, attracting more ants and leading to reinforcement of the pheromone trail on shorter paths. This is a positive feedback process that can also cause trails to persist on longer paths, even when a shorter path becomes available. To counteract this persistence on a longer path, ACO algorithms employ remedial measures, such as using negative feedback in the form of uniform evaporation on all paths. Obtaining high performance in ACO algorithms typically requires fine tuning several parameters that govern pheromone deposition and removal. This paper proposes a new ACO algorithm, called EigenAnt, for finding the shortest path between a source and a destination, based on selective pheromone removal that occurs only on the path that is actually chosen for each trip. We prove that the shortest path is the only stable equilibrium for EigenAnt, which means that it is maintained for arbitrary initial pheromone concentrations on paths, and even when path lengths change with time. The EigenAnt algorithm uses only two parameters and does not require them to be finely tuned. Simulations that illustrate these properties are provided. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ant Colony Optimization; Collective foraging; Distributed optimization; Optimization; Pheromone; Selective removal of pheromone; Self-organization; Stability analysis; Stagnation; Swarm intelligence","Feedback; Graph theory; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Swarm intelligence; Collective foraging; Distributed optimization; Pheromone; Selective removal; Self organizations; Stability analysis; Stagnation; Ant colony optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874677125

This paper summarizes the field of biometrics and investigates the potential of utilizing biometrics beyond the presently limited field of security applications. There are some synergies that can be established within security-related applications. These can also be relevant in other fields such as health and ambient intelligence. This paper describes these synergies. Overall, this paper highlights some interesting and exciting research areas as well as possible synergies between different applications using biometric information. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ambient intelligence; Biometrics; Healthcare; Security","Ambient intelligence; Biometric applications; Biometric informations; Human being; Potential applications; Security; Security application; Artificial intelligence; Health care; Information use; Biometrics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874556693

We can now take advantage of information technology (IT) devices to make migration decisions and hazard analysis. The range of IT applications is very wide, and could include robot manufacturing, remote exploration, fuzzy Lyapunov techniques, artificial intelligence, intelligent devices, tension leg platform design, consumer and service quality, and management information systems. Management information systems are especially helpful to medical personnel when carrying out the treatment and medication of patients. Sometimes, though, hospital staff might not have immediate access to a patient's records such as response to treatments, medication status, or examination results because the computer equipment is not easily portable. In such situations, it is only possible to keep written records, with the data being cataloged or referred to only after returning to the nursing station or office. If the hospital could implement a computerized medical service cart for use in the wards, the above problems would be solved. These computers could use a wireless network system, linked with the central server to access information. The technology now exists and the era of the smart phone has now been entered. Smart phones/tablet PCs could be applied for clinical medical care. For the elderly and patients with chronic diseases, smart health devices designed for home care service are necessary and should be applied as soon as possible. This study designs a wireless physiology signal monitoring system that uses a smart phone with a wireless network apparatus to provide convenient monitoring for patients in the home care service system. The wireless care system is designed for patients who need long-term home care services or assistance with chronic diseases.

However, real-life data (and workloads) are often not publicly available due to IPR constraints or privacy concerns. And even if available, they are often limited regarding scalability and variability of data characteristics. On the other hand, while easily scalable, synthetically generated data often fail to adequately reflect real-life data characteristics. While there are well established synthetic benchmarks and data generators for, e.g., business data (TPC-C, TPC-H), there is no such up-to-date data generator, let alone benchmark, for spatiotemporal and/or moving objects data. In this work, we present a data generator for spatiotemporal data. More specifically, our data generator produces synthetic GPS traces, mimicking the GPS traces that GPS navigation devices generate. To this end, our generator is fed with real-life statistical profiles derived from the user base and uses real-world road network information. Spatial scalability is achieved by choosing statistics from different regions. The data volume can be scaled by tuning the number and length of the generated trajectories.

In order to deal with this challenge in planning and control of logistics activities, several solutions have been introduced. One of the most latest one is the application of autonomy. The paradigm of autonomy in inbound logistics, can be reflected in decisions for real-time scheduling and control of material flows. Integration of autonomous control with material carrier objects can realize the expected advantages of this alternative into shop-floors. Since pallets (bins, fixtures, etc.) are some common used carrier objects in logistics, they have the potential to undertake the responsibility of real-time jobs dispatching to machines in the shop-floor scheduling problem. Hence, the current paper covers the problem of real-time scheduling in a stochastic and complex shop-floor environment, by means of autonomy. Indeed, the sustainment's advantage of pallets in manufacturing systems has inspired the idea of developing learning pallets (Lpallets) with the capability of autonomous control in complex and uncertain logistics environment with abrupt changes. Among some intelligent techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) and, specially, the radial basis function network (RBFN) is selected to transmit the abilities of intelligent decision-making as well as learning to Lpallets in a distributed manner. Some variants in training and RBFN application alternatives are considered to evaluate the competency of RBFN for Lpallets. An Lpallet makes its dispatching and control decision based on its own experience and intelligence about the entire system and local situations in an exemplary hybrid flow-open shop problem. To prove the claimed application of RBFN in autonomous Lpallets a discrete-event simulation model is developed for the assembly scenario. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Flow-open shop scheduling problem; Inbound logistics; Radial basis function network","Autonomous control; Business environments; Control decisions; Discrete-event simulation model; Entire system; Inbound logistics; Intelligent decision-making; Intelligent techniques; Material Flow; Planning and control; Real time scheduling; Scheduling problem; Shop floor; Shop scheduling; Shopfloors; Floors; Neural networks; Pallets; Radial basis function networks; Scheduling; Control theory; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; decision making; fuzzy system; kernel method; linear system; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; nonlinear system; priority journal; probability; radial basis function network; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868616339

Such mechanisms are warranted in the context of discovery because they can make prover sessions more efficient (less time searching the library) and can compress proofs (the more knowledge that is implicitly available, the less needs to be explicitly said by the formalizer). In the context of justification, though, implicit knowledge may need to be made explicit. To study implicit knowledge in proof assistants, one must first characterize what implicit knowledge should be made explicit. Then, once a class of implicit background knowledge is identified, one needs to determine how to extract it from proofs. When a class of implicit knowledge is made explicit, we may then inquire to what extent the implicit knowledge is needed for any particular proof; it often happens that proofs can be successful even if some of the implicit knowledge is omitted. In this note we describe an experiment conducted on the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) of formal mathematical proofs concerning a particular class of implicit background knowledge, namely, properties of functions and relations (e.g.; commutativity, asymmetry, etc.). In our experiment we separate, for each theorem of the MML, the needed function and relation properties from the unneeded ones.

To this end, a translation from a time-annotated computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) model of a clinical protocol into a temporal hierarchical task network (HTN) planning domain is presented. Materials and methods: The proposed method uses a knowledge-driven reasoning process to translate knowledge previously described in a CIG into a corresponding HTN Planning and Scheduling domain, taking advantage of HTNs known ability to (i) dynamically cope with temporal and resource constraints, and (ii) automatically generate customized plans. The proposed method, focusing on the representation of temporal knowledge and based on the identification of workflow and temporal patterns in a CIG, makes it possible to automatically generate time-annotated and resource-based care pathways tailored to the needs of any possible patient profile. Results: The proposed translation is illustrated through a case study based on a 70 pages long clinical protocol to manage Hodgkin's disease, developed by the Spanish Society of Pediatric Oncology. We show that an HTN planning domain can be generated from the corresponding specification of the protocol in the Asbru language, providing a running example of this translation. Furthermore, the correctness of the translation is checked and also the management of ten different types of temporal patterns represented in the protocol. By interpreting the automatically generated domain with a state-of-art HTN planner, a time-annotated care pathway is automatically obtained, customized for the patient's and institutional needs. The generated care pathway can then be used by clinicians to plan and manage the patients long-term care. Conclusion: The described methodology makes it possible to automatically generate patient-tailored care pathways, leveraging an incremental knowledge-driven engineering process that starts from the expert knowledge of medical professionals. The presented approach makes the most of the strengths inherent in both CIG languages and HTN planning and scheduling techniques: for the former, knowledge acquisition and representation of the original clinical protocol, and for the latter, knowledge reasoning capabilities and an ability to deal with complex temporal and resource constraints. Moreover, the proposed approach provides immediate access to technologies such as business process management (BPM) tools, which are increasingly being used to support healthcare processes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical decision support systems; Clinical pathways; Hodgkin disease; Patient care planning; Pediatric oncology; Planning and scheduling; Practice guideline","Clinical decision support systems; Clinical pathways; Patient care; Pediatric oncology; Planning and scheduling; Practice guideline; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Decision support systems; Enterprise resource management; Flow measurement; Health care; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Oncology; Pediatrics; Translation (languages); Medical computing; article; computer interpretable guideline; computer network; hierarchical task network; Hodgkin disease; practice guideline; priority journal; Antineoplastic Protocols; Artificial Intelligence; Critical Pathways; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Long-Term Care; Patient Care Planning; Pediatrics; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Workflow",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875094102

Firstly, the process planning problem, considering the selection of machining resources, operations sequence optimization and the manufacturing constraints, is mapped to a weighted graph and is converted to a constraint-based traveling salesman problem. The operation sets for each manufacturing features are mapped to city groups, the costs for machining processes (including machine cost and tool cost) are converted to the weights of the cities; the costs for preparing processes (including machine changing, tool changing and set-up changing) are converted to the 'distance' between cities. Then, the mathematical model for process planning problem is constructed by considering the machining constraints and goal of optimization. The ACO algorithm has been employed to solve the proposed mathematical model. In order to ensure the feasibility of the process plans, the Constraint Matrix and State Matrix are used in this algorithm to show the state of the operations and the searching range of the candidate operations. Two prismatic parts are used to compare the ACO algorithm with tabu search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm.

Some of this content, such as advertisements, generate revenues, while other contents generate revenues associated to a service, such as Video on Demand (VoD). One of the main concerns for current multimedia platforms is therefore the provisioning of content to end-users that generates revenue. Alternatives currently being explored include user-content generation as the content source (the prosumer model). However, a large source of revenue has pretty much been neglected, which corresponds to the capability of transforming, adapting content produced either by Content Providers (CPs) or by the end-user according to different categories, such as client location, personal settings, or business considerations, and to distribute such modified content. This chapter discusses and addresses this gap, proposing a content customization and distribution system for changing content consumption, by adapting content according to target end-user profiles (such as end-user personal tastes or its local social or geographic community). The aim is to give CPs ways to allow users and/or Service Providers (SPs) to configure contents according to different criteria, improving users' quality of experience and SPs' revenues generation, and to possibly charge users and SPs (e.g. advertisers) for such functionalities. The authors propose to employ artificial intelligence techniques, such as mixture of Gaussians, to learn the functional constraints faced by people, objects, or even scenes on a movie stream in order to support the content modification process. The solutions reported will allow SPs to provide the end-user with automatic ways to adapt and configure the (on-line, live) content to their tastes-and even more-to manipulate the content of live (or off-line) video streams (in the way that photo editing did for images or video editing, to a certain extent, did for off-line videos). © 2013, IGI Global.",,"Telecommunication services; Video streaming; Artificial intelligence techniques; Content customization; Functional constraints; Mixture of Gaussians; Personalized multimedia; Quality of experience (QoE); Telecommunication operators; Video on demands (VoD); Video on demand",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900069074

The identification of best management options is technically challenging because of the lack of scientific tools to inform resource managers of future responses/impacts of these different options. This paper proposes a decision support system which aims at greatly improving stakeholder dialogue and decision making. The system consists of two main components: an integrated agent-based model for simulating recreational fishing behavior and reef ecosystem dynamics; and an evaluation model based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) together with a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The evaluation component is responsible for assessing alternative strategies based on the simulation outputs generated by the former. We apply the proposed system to the assessment of management strategies for recreational fishing in the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia. A set of management strategies, including a ""business-as-usual"" strategy and six alternative site closure strategies are assessed using the proposed solution. The site closure strategies evaluated vary in length and number of popular sites closed. The evaluation results illustrate the usefulness of the proposed system in tackling complex management choices. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the stakeholder or decision maker outcome preference weights and provide measures for assessing the sensitivity of strategy ranking outcomes to changes in these weights. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based model; AHP; Decision support system; Integrated economic-biophysical modeling; Multiple criteria decision making; TOPSIS","Agent based; Agent-based model; AHP; Business-as-usual; Complex management; Coral reef systems; Decision makers; Ecosystem dynamics; Evaluation models; Evaluation results; Future response; Management options; Management strategies; Marine park; Multiple criteria decision making; Resource managers; Scientific tool; Simulation model; Site closure; Socio-economics; Stakeholder dialogue; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; TOPSIS; Western Australia; Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Hierarchical systems; Reefs; Fisheries; best management practice; decision making; decision support system; fishing effort; hierarchical system; numerical model; recreational management; reef; resource management; simulation; stakeholder; tracking; Australia; Ningaloo Marine Park; Western Australia; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872131505

The FGP is an annual directive concerned with scheduling the activities that are undertaken by the RAN units. Required activities are specified in an associated document called the Navy Activity Schedule (NAS). The NAS provides overarching guidance to RAN maritime operations planning staff on Navy's priorities and resource levels for operational commitments, preparedness levels and international and domestic engagement activities. The FGP is manually generated as a result of interactions and conferences involving Navy operations' authorities. A scheduling tool, the Fleet Activity Management Tool (FAMT), allows schedulers to coordinate unit assignments to activities while keeping track of other factors such as requirements for units to undergo maintenance and personnel to have rest and recreation. The scheduler makes heuristic choices based on 'business' rules dictated by policy documents. However, while FAMT can help to generate the FGP, the actual scheduling of units to NAS activities requires an operator to make the assignment. Manual scheduling can be time consuming and is not guaranteed to cover all the required activities in the most efficient manner. Typically, much iteration of the schedules occurs. This paper describes a simple decision support system for scheduling RAN fleet units using automation. The paper starts by describing the employment allocation problem and the constraints conditioning the generation of an appropriate overall schedule. Then it focuses on describing the heuristic approach of the solver using a simulated annealing algorithm, together with its flexible interaction with the planning tool FAMT. The optimisation model developed here offers schedulers the advantage of considering many candidate schedules to determine the best schedule. Apart from the obvious opportunities for labour reduction, automation also offers the advantage of providing a consistent repeatable process with robust evaluation criteria as to the quality of a FGP. In comparison to an actual FGP, the FGP generator demonstrated an improvement in the allocation of units to the NAS by about 30% on key fleet management measures, with commensurate improvements to training opportunities and preparedness. Trial runs of the FGP generator consistently found satisfactory unit allocation schedules for difficult pathological scenarios. This research shows that automation of the FGP can lead to substantial improvements in efficiency, while maintaining satisfactory unit programmes, and ensuring that RAN fleet units can meet their on-going and emerging commitments. The solver has been integrated into FAMT and is available to schedulers. The paper notes some avenues for improvement of both FAMT and the FGP solver and the method's applicability to wider defence resource allocation problems. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Heuristics; Naval units; Optimisation; Scheduling; Simulated annealing","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Decision support systems; Fleet operations; Heuristic methods; Human resource management; Iterative methods; Operations research; Simulated annealing; Submarines; Day-to-day operations; Heuristics; Naval units; Operational commitments; Optimisations; Resource allocation problem; Royal Australian Navy; Simulated annealing algorithms; Scheduling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080942994

When coupled with Geographic Information Systems, however, BI can be transformed into a cutting edge decision support system for planning local and regional areas, as we demonstrate in this paper. Local and regional governments often face a major challenge in terms of developing a holistic view upon disjointedly operated utility services in their jurisdictions due to data silos. This limitation has become a serious impediment to infrastructure planning and regional adaptation to changes. Geo-BI provides tools to manage data coming from multiple and disparate sources, and visualize them through online interactive user-interfaces. The SMART Infrastructure Dashboard (SID) is an innovative Geo-BI solution that includes an open-source ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) toolkit to handle various datasets, a spatially-enabled data warehouse hosted in PostgreSQL/PostGIS and proprietary BI software for creating and administering analytical reports and dashboards. SID allows planners and policy makers to analyze the interplay between the use of infrastructure services, demographics and weather parameters across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, SID enables planners to run various what-if scenarios related to projected consumption patterns, service vulnerability of utility networks, and transportation demand management. Future research involves enabling the analysis of networks of networks through SID to understand the propagation of cascading failures and benefits in interconnected utility networks. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Geospatial Business Intelligence; Infrastructure; Regional Planning","Artificial intelligence; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Information analysis; Open source software; Operations research; Planning; Regional planning; User interfaces; Extract , transform and loads; Geo-spatial; Infrastructure; Infrastructure planning; Infrastructure services; Interactive user interfaces; Spatial and temporal scale; Transportation demand management; Open systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080861777

Migrant entrepreneurship has a considerable welfare enhancing impact on the city, notably a contribution to innovation and growth, creation of new jobs for less favoured population groups, advancement of benefits from cultural diversity, and reinforcement of economic opportunities related to international connectivity. The present paper aims to investigate the backgrounds of migrant entrepreneurship in large Dutch cities, in particular, the critical success factors of business performance of these entrepreneurs in relation to their ethnic background, their levels of skill, and other specific and general contextual factors. To address the drivers of break-out strategies for new markets, a sample of second-generation Moroccan entrepreneurs is extensively interviewed to extract detailed information at a micro business level. The wealth of qualitative information on both input factors and output (performance) achievements is next systematically coded in a qualitative survey table which is converted into a format that is suitable for application of a rough set analysis. This is an artificial intelligence technique that is able to extract and identify the set of combinations of different drivers that altogether make up for a final outcome.

The project aims at the development of a framework to build use case specific tools which will allow decision-makers to cross-examine dynamic crisis scenario evolutions, to set action parameters of operational and strategic activities, and to visualise impacts and crisis evolvement. This will be achieved by providing a modular and open software framework to build planning and decision support systems for modelling and simulating realistic crisis scenarios and their possible consequences. CRISMA applications simulate and analyse the development of a simulated “World” in a crisis management context. A World is defined as a coherent set of data, simulation models operating on this data and the model control parameters governing the activity of these models. A snapshot of the World, or World State, consists of all data related to a specific crisis simulation experiment. This includes a set of information to control simulation models operating on the World data as well as a set of condensed, representative and quantitative information that can be used for a qualitative assessment of a world state. The user can influence a crisis evolvement by changing control parameters of the simulation models. Every modification of a World State is considered a distinct decision point and eventually produces a new World State. This leads to a decision tree. The architectural design approach uses several concepts from previous projects focusing on reference models, reference architectures and simulation-specific standards. For the CRISMA architecture, the project adopts certain common concepts that support a systematic architectural design process. In order to demonstrate and validate the design, five pilot sites are used to provide experimentation for validation and testing of a wide range of crisis management situations (coastal floods, extreme weather conditions, geophysical hazards, multi-organisational and cross-border cooperation in crisis management, planning and training for resource management). Piloting will include multi-risk and domino effects. The paper presents the business logic and key aspects of the CRISMA architecture. The work presented is work in progress, published during the design stage of the architecture.

The starting point of research is ignorance: if we already have answers to our questions or simply undertaking routine works to get answers, we wouldn't be undertaking research in the first instance. Australia spends approximately 2.2% GDP (or $27.7B AUD) in research and development. So we are taking considerable risks as a country. Fortunately, some research areas are less risky than others. They have well-established theoretical foundations and experimental methodologies, proper access to infrastructures and equipment, and above all a critical mass of researchers to advance the state of knowledge. In ""emerging"" areas of research however the risks are considerably higher there may not be an established theory, methodology, or even a critical mass of researchers available. Finding the right approach to fund emerging research is a serious policy challenge. The European Research Council and the National Science Foundation (in the U.S.) have both independently initiated works in developing approaches to identify and fund emerging research in recent years. If we accept the suggestion that research investment is akin to portfolio investment (to maximize the expected return while minimize risk over an entire investment portfolio), then investing in emerging research amounts to investing in high risk options with high expected return. But how do we pick ""winners"" from ""imposers""? How can we tell we are not picking ""one hit wonders""? How can we spot ""sleeping beauties"" which may take years to mature? The availability of large scale global bibliographic (and other relevant) data from both open and commercial sources presents an intriguing opportunity for data miners and machine learners to contribute to these debates. In this presentation, we shall examine the general shape of the problem definition to look at the ""why"" and ""what"" instead of the ""how"".

In order to identify the relationships among these goals, we need to carry out case studies in selected mines based on those events happened in the past and those might occur in the future. However, these types of case studies are often isolated and lack of coherence when an optimal solution is sought at a regional scale with multiple mine sites. One of the key challenges is the lack of the context and scope for identifying and quantifying the causal and inter-dependency relationships among the factors that constrained the competing goals. Therefore it is difficult to capture the actual requirements which are essential to the development of a decision support system for mine water management. This paper presents a holistic approach to capturing the requirements for mine water management through the design of a scenario model for supporting case studies. The scenario model is depicted through three perspectives: the business perspective shows the mining activities and decisions according to their business hierarchies, such as within a mine or across several mines or companies. The profiles of a number of mines are collected and anonymised to form a hypothetical mining company and put into a geographical location under investigation; the environment perspective represents all the climate change patterns, such as rainfall and catchment histories and weather forecast data; the decision perspective demonstrates how alternative decisions on water management strategies would impact on the operations of the given mine sites in the selected environmental conditions. A number of case studies have been constructed based on the designed scenario model, such as the proactive water management according to weather forecasts, the assessment of the effectiveness of water sharing and trading among multiple mine sites, as well as the evaluation of the costs and benefits of establishing water management infrastructure in mine sites. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Case Studies; Mine Water Management; Requirement Engineering; Scenario Modelling","Artificial intelligence; Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Commerce; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Groundwater; Mine flooding; Operations research; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Water management; Weather forecasting; Case-studies; Environmental conditions; Geographical locations; Management infrastructure; Mine waters; Requirement engineering; Scenario modelling; Water management strategies; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975160765

While there are many ways in which domestic tax bases can be eroded, a significant source of base erosion is profit shifting. Whilst further work on the data related to base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) is important and necessary, there is no question that BEPS is a pressing and current issue for a number of jurisdictions. In this context, the G20 has welcomed the work that the OECD is undertaking in this area and has requested a report about progress of the work for their February 2013 meeting. While there clearly is a tax compliance aspect, as shown by a number of high profile cases, there is a more fundamental policy issue: The international common principles drawn from national experiences to share tax jurisdiction may not have kept pace with the changing business environment. Domestic rules for international taxation and internationally agreed standards are still grounded in an economic environment characterised by a lower degree of economic integration across borders, rather than today's environment of global taxpayers, characterised by the increasing importance of intellectual property as a value-driver and by constant developments of information and communication technologies. Early on it was recognised that the interaction of domestic tax systems can lead to overlaps in the exercise of taxing rights that can result in double taxation. Domestic and international rules to address double taxation, many of which originated with principles developed by the League of Nations in the 1920s, aim at addressing these overlaps so as to minimise trade distortions and impediments to sustainable economic growth. The interaction of domestic tax systems (including rules adopted in accordance with international standards to relieve double taxation), however, can also lead to gaps that provide opportunities to eliminate or significantly reduce taxation on income in a manner that is inconsistent with the policy objectives of such domestic tax rules and international standards. While multinational corporations urge co-operation in the development of international standards to alleviate double taxation resulting from differences in domestic tax rules, they often exploit differences in domestic tax rules and international standards that provide opportunities to eliminate or significantly reduce taxation. This report aims to present the issues related to BEPS in an objective and comprehensive manner. The report first describes studies and data available in the public domain regarding the existence and magnitude of BEPS (summaries of the studies are included in Annex B). It then contains an overview of global developments that have an impact on corporate tax matters. The core of the report sets out an overview of the key principles that underlie the taxation of cross-border activities, as well as the BEPS opportunities these principles may create. It also analyses some well-known corporate structures (described in more detail in Annex C) and highlights the most important issues that these structures raise. The report concludes that, in addition to a need for increased transparency on effective tax rates of MNEs, key pressure areas include those related to: • International mismatches in entity and instrument characterisation including, hybrid mismatch arrangements and arbitrage; • Application of treaty concepts to profits derived from the delivery of digital goods and services; • The tax treatment of related party debt-financing, captive insurance and other intra-group financial transactions; • Transfer pricing, in particular in relation to the shifting of risks and intangibles, the artificial splitting of ownership of assets between legal entities within a group, and transactions between such entities that would rarely take place between independents; • The effectiveness of anti-avoidance measures, in particular GAARs, CFC regimes, thin capitalisation rules and rules to prevent tax treaty abuse; • The availability of harmful preferential regimes. A number of indicators show that the tax practices of some multinational companies have become more aggressive over time, raising serious compliance and fairness issues. These issues were already flagged by tax commissioners at the 2006 meeting of the Forum on Tax Administration in Seoul and different instruments have been developed to better analyse and react to aggressive tax planning schemes which result in massive revenue losses. The OECD work on aggressive tax planning, including its directory of aggressive tax planning schemes, is being used by government officials from several countries. Some countries are intensively drawing on this work to improve their audit performance. Improving tax compliance, on-shore and off-shore, remains a key priority for both securing governments' revenue and levelling the playing field for businesses. It requires determined action from tax administrations, which should co-operate in exchanging intelligence and information, as well as monitoring the effectiveness of the strategies used, for example in terms of additional tax revenue assessed/collected, and in terms of enhanced compliance. This report also shows that current international tax standards may not have kept pace with changes in global business practices, in particular in the area of intangibles and the development of the digital economy. For example, today it is possible to be heavily involved in the economic life of another country, e.g. by doing business with customers located in that country via the internet, without having a taxable presence there or in another country that levies tax on profits. In an era where non-resident taxpayers can derive substantial profits from transacting with customers located in another country, questions are being raised on whether the current rules are fit for purpose. Further, as businesses increasingly integrate across borders and tax rules often remain unco-ordinated, there are a number of structures, technically legal, which take advantage of asymmetries in domestic and international tax rules. The OECD has already produced analytical work to better understand and react to the issue of hybrid mismatch arrangements through which taxable income in effect disappears (Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements: Policy and Compliance Issues, 2012). Work has also been launched to address some of the new challenges. Proposals to update the OECD's transfer pricing guidelines in the area of intangibles and to simplify their application have been tabled and should be advanced quickly to provide immediate responses to some of the most critical profit shifting challenges. Simplification should also ensure that tax administrations have access to better tools for assessing tax compliance risks. This involves the development of documentation requirements able to provide tax auditors with the full picture of business operations. In the recent past, the OECD also identified a number of avenues to better assess tax compliance risks, such as those described in Tackling Aggressive Tax Planning through Improved Transparency and Disclosure (OECD, 2011). Finally, major progress towards transparency has been achieved over the past four years with the establishment of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. More fundamentally, a holistic approach is necessary to properly address the issue of BEPS. Government actions should be comprehensive and deal with all the different aspects of the issue. These include, for example, the balance between source and residence taxation, the tax treatment of intragroup financial transactions, the implementation of anti-abuse provisions, including CFC legislation, as well as transfer pricing rules. A comprehensive approach, globally supported, should draw on an in-depth analysis of the interaction of all these pressure points. It is clear that co-ordination will be key in the implementation of any solution, though countries may not all use the same instruments to address the issue of BEPS. What is at stake is the integrity of the corporate income tax. A lack of response would further undermine competition, as some businesses, such as those which operate cross-border and have access to sophisticated tax expertise, may profit from BEPS opportunities and therefore have unintended competitive advantages compared with enterprises that operate mostly at the domestic level. In addition to issues of fairness, this may lead to an inefficient allocation of resources by distorting investment decisions towards activities that have lower pre-tax rates of return, but higher after-tax rates of return. Finally, if other taxpayers (including ordinary individuals) think that multinational corporations can legally avoid paying income tax it will undermine voluntary compliance by all taxpayers - upon which modern tax administration depends. Because many BEPS strategies take advantage of the interface between the tax rules of different countries, it may be difficult for any single country, acting alone, to fully address the issue. Furthermore unilateral and uncoordinated actions by governments responding in isolation could result in the risk of double - And possibly multiple - Taxation for business. This would have a negative impact on investment, and thus on growth and employment globally. In this context, the major challenge is not only to identify appropriate responses, but also the mechanisms to implement them in a streamlined manner, in spite of the well-known existing legal constraints, such as the existence of more than 3 000 bilateral tax treaties. It is therefore essential that countries consider innovative approaches to implement comprehensive solutions. © OECD 2013.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957761409

PROLOG is well-known for its qualities in the development of sophisticated rule systems. It is desirable to combine the advantages of PROLOG with JAVA, since JAVA has become one of the most used programming languages in industry. However, experts of both programming languages are rare. To overcome the resulting interoperability problems, we have developed a framework which generates a JAVA archive that provides methods to query a given set of PROLOG rules; it ensures that valid knowledge bases are transmitted between JAVA and PROLOG. We use XML Schema for describing the format for exchanging a knowledge base between PROLOG and JAVA. From the XML Schema desciption, we scaffold JAVA classes; the JAVA programmer can use them and fill in the open slots by statements accessing other JAVA data structures. The data structure on the JAVA side reflects the complex structured knowledge base, with which the PROLOG rules work, in an object-oriented way. We can to some extend verify the correctness of the data set / knowledge base sent from JAVA to PROLOG using standard methods for XML Schema. Moreover, we can add constraints that go beyond XML. For instance, we can specify standard integrity constraints known from relational databases, such as primary key, foreign key, and not-null constraints. Since we are dealing with complex structured XML data, however, there can be far more general integrity constraints. These can be expressed by standard PROLOG rules, which can be evaluated on the PROLOG side; they could also be compiled to JAVA by available PROLOG to JAVA converters such as Prolog Cafe - since they will usually be written in a supported subset of PROLOG. We have used our framework for integrating PROLOG business rules into a commercial E-Commerce system written in JAVA.","Business rules; JAVA; Logic programming; PROLOG","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Data structures; Java programming language; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Logic programming; Object oriented programming; Scaffolds; Software engineering; XML; Business rules; E-commerce systems; Integrity constraints; JAVA; PROLOG; Relational Database; Standard integrity; Structured knowledge; PROLOG (programming language)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924297884

The technical realization of this vision is a complex challenge as distributed heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. To cope with this issue, we propose the synergic exploitation of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: the agent-oriented and the cloud computing paradigms. While the former can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems, the latter can empower the IoT objects with more computing and memory resources and effectively support system-wide higher-level mechanisms and policies.

In today’s world, quantitative methods are crucial for prediction purposes in cost management. On the basis of studying some typical methods of cost prediction, we propose a cost prediction method based on an improved fuzzy model. Firstly, owning to the inefficiency of existing fuzzifier, such that it is difficult to determine the number of fuzzy rules, we present an improved fuzzy c-means (FCM) fuzzifier to solve this problem referring to “granulation–degranulation” strategy and sample error function. Secondly, a fuzzy model based on the improved FCM fuzzifier is constructed through combining Takagi–Sugen–Kang fuzzy inference system. The algorithm of the improved fuzzy model is also realized by this study. Finally, through a series of experimental analyses for steel number product and steel class product of certain machinery enterprise, the results have demonstrated that the proposed method has the better prediction accuracy, which can be used effectively and practically in real-world cost prediction. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012","Artificial Intelligence; Cost Prediction; Fcm Fuzzifier; Fuzzy Model; Machinery Enterprises; Time Series","Artificial intelligence; Costs; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Machinery; Operating costs; Time series; Cost prediction; Experimental analysis; Fuzzifier; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy modeling; Improved fuzzy c-means; Improved fuzzy models; Machinery enterprise; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923317203

Traditional languages as BPMN or BPEL take an imperative style for defining the exact sequences of activities to execute. The imperative approach identifies a narrow space of solution that is generally optimized by the experience. However it does not provide enough freedom of action to bypass obstacles when something exceptional happens. In the wake of declarative specification languages we propose a framework, based on the standard BPMN, in which both business goals and the operative context are monitored for changes during the execution time. To enable a flexible adaptivity of the process to a changing environment we adopt the solution of relax some constraints of the rigid BPMN specification thus to give autonomous software agents the opportunity of exploring a wider space of solution, even when this space evolves unexpectedly or contains uncertainty. The result is a multi-agent system that exploits its features (mainly autonomy and proactivity) in order to monitor the execution state of the process and to discover a distributed solution to unpredictable situations or to specifications' evolution. © 2013 CEUR Workshop Proceedings.",,"Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Intelligent agents; Multi agent systems; Software agents; Specification languages; Specifications; Autonomous software agents; Business Process; Changing environment; Distributed solutions; Dynamic workflow execution; Research agenda; Run-time evolutions; Self adaptation; Autonomous agents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922937010

PBX is a business telephone system designed to deliver voice or video over a data network and interoperate with the normal Public Switched Telephone Network. This helps enabling businesses to use their managed intranet and reduce long distance expenses with greater cost savings. We use SIP protocol standard which supports telephony as well as a wide range of other communication modes. We already owned Cisco SIP telephones other than those offered by Avaya and reused these Cisco telephones by integrating with Session manager, which is a SIP routing and integration process and the core component within the Enterprise solution. We also implemented Linux based feature server i.e. Communication manager to provide call related features, origination phases, termination phases or both when SIP enabled, registers with the Session Manager core. Lastly, with the help of Message Sequence Tracing methodology we achieve the desired results of SIP registration along with features on PBX using Session Manager and Communication Manager.","IMS; Session Manager and Media servers; SIP; VoIP","Artificial intelligence; Computer operating systems; Internet telephony; Managers; Switching circuits; Telephone circuits; Telephone sets; Voice/data communication systems; Business telephone systems; IMS; Media servers; Public switched telephone network; Session Initiation Protocols; SIP; Voice over IP networks; VoIP; Internet protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907553786

The paper focuses on the idea of distorting original dataset using sbased fuzzy membership function to produce distorted dataset. Initially data is owned by an authorized user performs distortion .The Authorized user having original dataset distorts using fuzzy membership function and publish the distorted data to the Analyst. The Analysts performs data mining techniques on the distorted dataset. Accuracy of Classifiers generated on distorted data is relative to the original, thus privacy is achieved.

Despite evidence from those success stories, the realizable benefits from such decision support technologies depend on their effects on organizational decision processes. Evidence on those effects is scattered throughout management and decision support systems research. The need for more integrative research on this topic has been expressed from both research communities. Therefore we focused our research goal on those effects and conducted a structured and extensive literature review. In this context, this paper provides three major contributions. First, we develop a research framework by integrating existing results on managerial decision processes. Then, using this research framework, we present the results from the structured literature review on the effects of decision support technologies on the distinct phases, characteristics and outcomes of decision processes. Finally, we discuss the findings and implications for business intelligence and analytics systems from a decision process perspective and propose future research directions.","Business analytics; Business intelligence; Decision processes; Decision support systems; Literature review","Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Computer supported cooperative work; Information systems; Business analytics; Decision process; Future research directions; Literature reviews; Managerial decision; Organizational performance; Research communities; Research frameworks; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905860775

Due to long-term contracts and strategic reference customers, users of traditional revenue management systems already account for varying worthiness of clients, and intuitively ignore or override booking control suggestions in order not to endanger customer relations. So in a holistic approach, the integration of both management concepts, each of decisive competitive impact, is suggested. However, a solid scientific foundation of this desirable decision support and an implemented (prototype) IT-system, that provides the revenue analyst with greater insights, higher accuracy, quality and trust in decision process, are still missing for manufacturing industry. Based on a literature review, we believe this paper is the first to define, formalize and analyze the decision-making problem associated with these partly diametric objectives. In particular, the paper introduces a decision support system for a manufacturing provider with limited capacity, supplying analysts with formatted and summarized data to make transparent and comprehensible control decisions, and suggesting specific booking control actions based on simulation results and integrated usage of provided data.","Customer relationship management; Decision support system; Manufacturing; Revenue management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Manufacture; Public relations; Sales; Customer relationship management; Decision-making problem; Long-term contracts; Manufacturing industries; Production capacity; Revenue management; Revenue maximizing; Scientific foundations; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905849593

A number of sophisticated optimization models have been suggested for the consideration of output interactions when selecting IS project portfolios, but usually, the necessary data required for their application in business practice is not available at the planning stage. The literature currently does not offer techniques on how to identify output interactions at the planning stage-a gap which we attribute to the semantical nature of output interactions. We contribute to filling this gap by applying semantic clustering-a technique originating in the text mining literature-to the field of information systems project portfolio selection. A prototypical decision support system is developed that uses latent semantic analysis and hierarchical clustering to identify potential output interactions among information systems project proposals based on semantic similarities within their goal descriptions. This research-in-progress paper focuses on the design of the prototype developed and argues that latent semantic analysis presents a very promising technique for the identification of output interactions among information systems projects.","Information Systems; Latent Semantic Analysis; Project Interactions; Project Portfolio Selection; Semantic Clustering","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Optimization; Semantics; Business practices; Hier-archical clustering; Latent Semantic Analysis; Optimization models; Project portfolio; Project portfolio selection; Semantic clustering; Semantic similarity; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905845358

The core of a PA-based decision aids consists of an empirical prediction model. It is common to create such models using statistical standard methods. We argue that this approach suffers from a partial modelling mismatch (PMM) because the internal (statistical) objective of the decision support model and the business objective of the decision maker differ. We explore the severity and consequences of PMM in the context of resale price prediction, which is an important decision support task in the car leasing industry. The key hypothesis of the paper is that PMM decreases the quality of decision support. To test this, we develop a modelling methodology that creates predictive decision support models in a way so as to account for business objectives. Empirical experiments on real-world data confirm the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we find evidence that i) PMM can substantially hurt decision quality, that ii) the new modelling approach is a suitable remedy, and that iii) it is generally important to consider the business objectives of decision makers when devising a predictive decision support model. With standard prediction methods falling short of this requirement, the paper makes a first step toward more business orientation in PA.","Business intelligence; Car leasing; Decision support systems; Predictive analytics","Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Information systems; Sales; Car leasing; Decision support models; Decision support task; Empirical prediction models; Managerial decision making; Modelling methodology; Predictive analytics; Statistical standards; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905842147

Such Active Labs are inspired by Social BPM Labs, which represent course units for experiencing business process modelling in a collaborative environment. First feedback related to Social BPM Labs indicated a positive effect on students' motivation. To leverage this outcome, during an Active Lab theoretical contents are combined with practical application and current research topics. Furthermore, the usage of active learning techniques like problem-based learning or role-play simulations is proposed to foster students' engagement with the ultimate goal to raise their motivation and thus reduce drop-out rates. Additionally, functionalities of a software platform are sketched that will support the planning, preparation, execution and evaluation of Active Labs.

The importance of having the intellectual curiosity, ability to effectively apply the acquired knowledge/skills and job expertise becomes even more crucial in the highly competitive, fast-paced workplace. As a result, students are increasingly pressured to excel and succeed in this compelling academic journey. Globalization and rapid advancements in technology have facilitated many new e-teaching tools and social media platforms to cope with changing trends in students' receptivity to information and communication styles, making it even more essential for educators to continually review the education system in order to convey knowledge to students more creatively and effectively. Consequently, the instructional approaches which influence the behavioral aspect of learning that motivate and stimulate an individual's interest in learning and effective understanding with acquiring of knowledge are essential to examine. With deeper reflection and analysis on the behavioral learning of students, instructors could better comprehend the needs and expectations which facilitate providing their students the necessary inputs. Through this instructional article, a learning framework 'Perspective Transformation of instructors in Pedagogical Strategies' is proposed to facilitate more effective learning among business students. The conceptual framework proposes a shift from instructor-centric to learner-centric in the instructional roles, design of curriculum and assessments, learning culture and feedback process, by adopting five essential strategies: (1) Performing different instructional roles for varying types of instructional approaches (2) Shift in learning culture: embracing creative learning; (3) Professional soft skills training; (4) Assessments based on three fundamentals of understanding, critical thinking and application; (5) Continuous process of correspondence between instructors and students coupled with reflection in terms of formative and summative feedback; These learning approaches within the proposed framework have been applied in the classroom context at Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, in Semester 2 Annual Year 12/13. They have resulted in good course assessment and examination outcomes with positive feedback from students. This framework continuously allows avenues for further exploration in terms of optimal and effective pedagogical approaches by incorporating practical solutions to calibrate and embrace the rapid changing learning needs and demands. © 2013 IEEE.","Active learning; Changing learning needs; Creative teaching and Instructional approaches; New generation learners","Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Engineering education; Feedback; Learning systems; Teaching; Active Learning; Changing learning needs; Creative teaching and Instructional approaches; Information and communication; Knowledge based economy; Nanyang Technological University; New generation learners; Perspective transformation; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904681571

In a classical SAP system landscape a central data warehouse (SAP BW) is used to integrate and analyze all enterprise data. In SAP BW most of the business logic required for complex analytical tasks (e.g., a complex currency conversion) is implemented in the application layer on top of a standard relational database. While being independent from the underlying database when using such an architecture, this architecture has two major drawbacks when analyzing Big Enterprise Data: (1) algorithms in ABAP do not scale with the amount of data and (2) data shipping is required. To this end, we present a novel programming language called SQLScript to efficiently support complex and scalable analytical tasks inside SAP's new main-memory database HANA. SQLScript provides two major extensions to the SQL dialect of SAP HANA: A functional and a procedural extension. While the functional extension allows the definition of scalable analytical tasks on Big Enterprise Data, the procedural extension provides imperative constructs to orchestrate the analytical tasks. The major contributions of this paper are two novel functional extensions: First, an extended version of the MapReduce programming model for supporting parallelizable user-defined functions (UDFs).

By the same token, review websites are often targeted by spammers with fraudulent reviews, either to exaggerate the positive features of a business itself or to defame a competitor with negative ratings/comments. Many consumers' online reviews contain such information as rating value, customer name, and descriptions about a product or service. This paper discusses methods that help web administrators and/or business managers identify the legitimate versus illegitimate customers, use auto regression moving average (ARMA) to predict ratings, and more importantly, detect fraudulent reviews by comparing the differences among customer class, predicted rating, and the actual rating by the customer.

It identifies decision point by looking for XOR-splits in petri-net workflow model and analyzing rules for each choice based on available attributes using decision tree. Problem emerges when decision mining technique is used on a workflow that does not use either XOR or AND splits, for example OR-split gateway logic. OR-split does not have explicit representation in petri nets and it makes decision mining algorithm cannot find its decision point. Workflow pattern that uses OR-split as its splitting logic is multi choice. Multi choice does not have its own explicit representation in form of petri net and it is problematic to apply decision mining to this workflow pattern. To make multi choice can be analyzed by decision miner some modification needs to be applied to the petri net representation of this pattern. This paper proposes modification of OR-split gateway representation in petri net. The new representation of OR-split uses combination the existing XOR-split and AND-split to make the model easier to be analyzed using decision miner. The proposed modification do not affect the conformance of event log and process model, but will allow each choice branch to be checked by decision miner. © 2013 IEEE.","decision mining; decision tree; multi choice; process mining; workflow pattern","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Information science; Learning systems; Miners; Petri nets; Explicit representation; Machine learning techniques; Mining techniques; Multi choices; Petri net representations; Process mining; Workflow modeling; Workflow patterns; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902438683

To automate composition several algorithms based on artificial intelligence planning [1], association rule mining [2], petri net [3], case based reasoning [4], genetic algorithm [5][6], neural network [7], etc, have been proposed. However all of these methods select services that only satisfy client’s requirements and behavior [8]. In a real world scenario choosing business service partners for composition on the fly automatically is impractical and often referred to as a toy model [9]. SLAKY System is a new realistic model for selection of business service partners. SLAKY System selects services on the fly considering the vision, time planning, environmental context, user adoption, usage policies, trust management, risk management, market scenario, native intelligence, and competitive profit management of collaborating service partners apart from functionality satisfaction for client’s requirements. In this paper we focus on profit management module. We have proposed SLAKY BWG algorithm for profit management where composition is done in a competitive manner by considering service providers and agent as competitors seeking to maximize their profits by selecting strategic composition as a Non-Zero sum business war game. The execution module executes the compositions as a mixed strategy so that both the agent and service provider gains profit. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Automatic Web Service Composition; Non-Zero sum game; SLAKY Composer; SLAKY OWL-S Upper Ontology","Case based reasoning; Genetic algorithms; Petri nets; Profitability; Quality of service; Risk management; Risk perception; Semantic Web; Websites; Artificial intelligence planning; Automatic web service compositions; Composition of semantic Web services; Environmental contexts; SLAKY Composer; Upper ontology; Web service composition; Zero-sum game; Web services",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900441098

It has been found spectacularly valuable in various contexts, including scientific discoveries, acquisition of business, and recommender systems. Although never formally proved with large-scale behavioral analysis, it is believed by scientists and practitioners that serendipity is an important factor of positive user experience and increased user engagement. In this paper, we take the initiative to study the ubiquitous occurrence of serendipitious information diffusion and its effect in the context of microblogging communities. We refer to serendipity as unexpected relevance, then propose a principled statistical method to test the unexpectedness and the relevance of information received by a microblogging user, which identifies a serendipitous diffusion of information to the user. Our findings based on large-scale behavioral analysis reveal that there is a surprisingly strong presence of serendipitous information diffusion in retweeting, which accounts for more than 25% of retweets in both Twitter and Weibo. Upon the identification of serendipity, we are able to conduct observational analysis that reveals the benefit of serendipity to microblogging users. Results show that both the discovery and the provision of serendipity increase the level of user activities and social interactions, while the provision of serendipitous information also increases the influence of Twitter users.

Hitherto there has not been any systematic study of whether one's action on Twitter (e.g., deciding when to post messages) is linked to one's culture (e.g., country's Pace of Life). To fix that, we build different network snapshots starting from 55,000 seed users on Twitter, and we do so for 10 weeks across 30 countries (after filtering those with low penetration rates) for a total of 2.34 M profiles. Based on Hofstede's theory of cultural dimensions and Levine's Pace of Life theory, we consider three behavioral patterns on Twitter (i.e., temporal predictability of tweets, engaging with others, and supporting others who are less popular) and associate them with three different dimensions derived from the two theories: Pace of Life, Individualism and Power Distance. We find the following strong correlations: activity predictability negatively correlates with Pace of Life (r = -0.62), tweets with mentions negatively correlates with Individualism (r = -0.55), and power (e.g, Twitter popularity) imbalance in relationships (between, for example, two users mentioning each other) is correlated with Power Distance (r = 0.62). These three cultural dimensions matter because they are associated with a country's socio-economic aspects-with GDP per capita, income inequality, and education expenditure.

Operations experts have been supported by tools for measuring plant performance, scheduling and planning generation and fuel demand, and assessing equipment health (collectively referred to in this paper as Predictive Analytics). Maintenance specialists are in turn supported by systems for work and maintenance management (referred to in this paper as Asset Management). However, the governance process by which these O&M activities and tools interact has been typically performed in an ad hoc manner, with high reliance on personal experience and with limited interchange of knowledge between the operations and maintenance specializations. Additionally, minimal detailed information from these groups is used in making strategic business decisions for capital planning and market trading (fuel, electricity) at corporate levels. Meanwhile, the O&M business functions are becoming more important than ever in mitigating consequences emerging from increasing load demand variability, environmental regulations, and shifting cost/competitive landscapes. This paper explores an opportunity to deal with these macro drivers and to achieve higher degrees of plant performance, agility, and resiliency, by closing knowledge and information gaps between operations, maintenance, and corporate business personnel and decision support systems. In doing so, the resulting collaboration between the experts and their supporting analytical systems can become part of a comprehensive and coordinated plant, fleet, and corporate strategy, as well as a new mechanism for capturing knowledge.","Asset management; Condition monitoring; Enterprise target architecture; Fuel management; Informed decisions; Predictive analytics; Thermal performance monitoring","Artificial intelligence; Asset management; Commerce; Condition monitoring; Decision support systems; Electric power generation; Environmental regulations; Fuels; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Tools; Fuel management; Informed decision; Predictive analytics; Target architectures; Thermal Performance; Maintenance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900341840

Among the myriad of explanations giving for construction cost overruns is the lack of required information upon which to base accurate estimation. Much of the financial decisions made at the time of decision to build is thus made in an environment of uncertainty and oftentimes, guess work. In this paper, data mining is presented as a key business tool to transform existing data into key decision support systems to increase estimate reliability and accuracy within the construction industry. Using 1600 water infrastructure projects completed between 2004 and 2012 within the UK, cost predictive models were developed using a combination of data mining techniques such as factor analysis, optimal binning and scree tests. These were combined with the learning and generalising capabilities of artificial neural network to develop the final cost models. The best model achieved an average absolute percentage error of 3.67% with 87% of the validation predictions falling within an error range of ±5%. The models are now being deployed for use within the operations of the industry partner to provide real feedback for model improvement.","Artificial neural networks; Cost estimation; Cost overrun; Data mining; Decision support system","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Construction industry; Cost estimating; Costs; Data mining; Decision support systems; Neural networks; Project management; Accurate estimation; Construction costs; Construction projects; Cost estimations; Cost overruns; Financial decisions; Predictive models; Water infrastructure; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900324742

Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by giving a different set of recommendations, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. In order to study these questions, we performed a large body of experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In each of the experiments, we compare a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible longterm effects of giving the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Our findings are that any difference in user satisfaction between the list is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.

The presumption is that the user would favorably review the item being recommended. The goal of our project is to predict how a user would rate an item he/she never rated, which is a generalization of the task recommendation engines perform. Previous work successfully employs machine learning techniques, particularly statistical methods. However, there are some outlier situations which are more difficult to predict, such as new users. In this paper we present a rating prediction approach targeted for entities for which little prior information exists in the database. We put forward and test a number of hypotheses, exploring recommendations based on nearest neighbor-like methods. We adapt existing common sense topic modeling methods to compute similarity measures between users and then use a relatively small set of key users to predict how the target user will rate a given business. We implemented and tested our system for recommending businesses using the Yelp Academic Dataset. We report initial results for topic-based rating predictions, which perform consistently across a broad range of parameters.

In some cases, the entire infrastructure of a company was brought down, resulting in a prolonged disablement of business, provided services, loss of money and reputation. Many methods, techniques and tools have been developed to secure the assets, network infrastructure and communication of various organisations. Intrusion detection is a relatively new addition to such methods, hence the tools that use advanced intrusion detection techniques started to appear only recently. Using intrusion detection methods, we are able to collect and use information from known types of attacks and find out if someone is trying or even attempting to penetrate our infrastructure or attack our assets. The information collected and accumulated in this way can then be used to harden the infrastructure/network security of the organisation/enterprise and possibly can be used for legal cases.

The type of tool, amount of effort and form of energy required depends on the output or object being created. As tools evolved into machines, they enhanced operator productivity. Hence, industry continues to invest heavily in machines to assist people to do more with less physical control and/or interaction. This involves automating functions previously completed manually. Taylorism and the Hawthorn experiments all contributed to optimising industrial outputs and value engineers continue to promote a mechanized workforce in order to minimise business variations in human performance and their behaviour. Researchers have also pursued this goal using Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques. This process of transforming cognitive functionality into machine actionable form has encompassed many careers. Machine Intelligence (MI) is becoming more aspirational, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabling the achievement of numerous goals. More recently, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been employed to provide a flexible framework for research and development. These frameworks facilitate the development of component interoperability, with coordination and cooperation techniques needed to solve real-world problems. However problems typically manifest in complex, dynamic and often hostile environments. Based on the effort to seek or facilitate human-like decision making within machines, it is clear that further research is required. This paper discusses one possible avenue. It involves future research, aimed at achieving a cognitive sub-system for use on-board platforms. The framework is introduced by describing the human-machine relationship, followed by the theoretic background into cognitive architectures and a conceptual mechanism that could be used to implement a virtual mind. One which could be used to improve automation, achieve greater independence and enable more autonomous behaviour within control systems. © 2013 The Authors.","Agents; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Autonomy; Multi-Agent Systems",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896911861

Much scholarly research and attention has been paid over many years to studies of the impact of ""Big Data"" and AI on businesses and other organizations, such as vertical industry segments like health care and banking as well as specialized domains such as militaty operations. The present work examines the potential applications and ramifications of these emerging technological changes on individuals and households within society, and uses the term-of-art ""SuperReality"" to describe the new ontological paradigm. This term is intended to suggest an environment in which individuals and households achieve historically unprecedented capabilities for capturing highly detailed data and information about their activities, storing and processing these resources, and obtaining timely notifications and alerts regarding events and required actions. A notional model is presented for this new ""SuperReality"" paradigm which captures its underlying integrated infrastructure and the layers of applications and services that comprise it. Opportunities for entrepreneurial business developments supporting commercialization of these nascent technological capabilities is also discussed. The present work is intended to help initiate the academic discussion and exploration of SuperReality, and is clearly an early stage treatment of this topic as opposed to a more definitive and finalized rendering which will require considerable future refinements and consensus-building dialogues.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Big data; Internet of things; SuperReality","Augmented reality; Information science; Artificial intelligence technologies; Big datum; Business development; Integrated infrastructure; Internet of Things (IOT); SuperReality; Technological capability; Technological change; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896446240

Therefore, the Web service composition has unfolded broadly in the research side. However, the current attempts to classify Web service composition is not appropriate to the objectives. This paper proposes a novel classification matrix for Web service composition, that distinguishes between the context and technology dimension. The context dimension is aimed at analyzing the QoS influence on the effort of Web service composition, while the technology dimension focuses on the technique influence on the effort.

But nowadays, accessing the internet is faced with many challenges. One of the most important challenges is to ensure security with vital role to provide security in websites. The text passwords are convenient and simplest form for a user authentication on websites and this level is more prone to security attacks. User mostly uses theses weak passwords and it is often used across several websites. The reuse of the same password in untrusted websites causes password threats. Hackers invoke password stealing methods to grab password such as phishing, malware and keyloggers. Hereby we propose the user authentication protocol named LOPass which creates long term password and one time password for authenticating the user. It has three phases as registration, login and recovery phase. In LOPass, random password is generated for each login. Registration is used for the registration of the user. Recovery phase is used, if the user's mobile phone gets lost. The user needs to remember only his long term password which is secret. © 2013 IEEE.","Long term password; LOPass; One time password; User authentication; Web security","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Internet; Personal computing; Websites; Long term password; LOPass; One time passwords; User authentication; WEB security; Authentication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894262927

The facts and rules of knowledge bases at the back end of decision support systems represent beliefs that are subject to revision. Belief revision is called for whenever an inconsistency occurs. Inconsistency may be due to an update that contradicts extant beliefs, or may have remained hidden before being uncovered. In particular, inconsistency is likely to appear in decision support systems based on distributed, mutually independent knowledge sources. If consistency is modeled by business rules, in the form of integrity constraints, then inconsistency can be measured, by sizing either the violated instances of constraints or the beliefs that cause constraint violations. Measures that quantify inconsistency enable a distinction of different degrees of integrity violations, and thus a relaxation of the intolerant all-or-nothing attitude of classical logic toward consistency. They also provide a logical foundation and justification of maintaining and reasoning with beliefs that possibly are inconsistent, without risking to lead to decisions that suffer too much from contradictory sources. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Internet; Management science; Constraint violation; Decision supports; Distributed decision; Integrity constraints; Knowledge basis; Knowledge sources; Logical foundations; Mutually independents; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893476270

In this paper, a proposal is presented to create a virtual meeting system that can use artificial intelligent components to support participants and help to produce effective and better meeting outcomes or to save time by doing tasks in the background for users. A belief that the new age of collaborative environments should consist of intelligent features led to the development of a stable prototype V-ROOM that can be used to test how and if artificial intelligence can facilitate each meeting participant according to her/his formal meeting role and also, if it can facilitate the pre and post meeting tasks. The development is based on previous work, which involved testing the system in a classroom setting and making appropriate improvements. The results of a review and a comparison of virtual meeting systems are presented. The final development of the meeting system will be based on feedback received from professionals in various domains. The findings so far highlight that intelligent systems are needed, especially since information that individuals have to know and process, is vast. One of the main issues that needs to be overcome is that current artificial intelligence is not able to provide totally reliable information, and for this reason in some circumstances, it could hinder a meeting's effectiveness. Thus it is contended that artificial intelligence should be used only as an assisting tool. The survey results showed that meeting summarisation is one of the most important new features that should be added to virtual meeting systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Facilitator role; Virtual collaboration; Virtual meetings","Artificial intelligence; Electronic commerce; Intelligent systems; Artificial intelligent; Classroom settings; Collaborative environments; Facilitator role; Multi-national companies; Virtual collaboration; Virtual meetings; Virtual organisations; Surveys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893219473

Arabic language is a Semitic language that used in twenty Middle East countries as an official language of hundreds of millions of people and considered as the religious language for all Muslims of various ethical and cultural backgrounds. Although there is much care of Arabic language traditionally, a lot of dictionaries and linguistics books in paper format and electronic versions are produced. Surprisingly little has been done in the field of computerized language and lexical resources as complete and finalized products. Scholars and researchers in the field of teaching Arabic for non-native speakers are doing great efforts but there is a lack of well defined framework for teaching Arabic as second language electronically and online basis. Most of these works are either incomplete, non well-designed, or there is a drawback of the pedagogy or syllabus completeness and fitness. Therefore, an attractive system for teaching Arabic as second language has been proposed based on the online self-learning and self-assessment concepts.

However, these assumptions are not always true. Users' preferences can be subjective, implicit, vague, mixed and different for various types of processes. Besides, not all the preferences for example easy-to-use can be computed using formulas.

The question is about the management of data for optimal selection within the cube. A good inspiration is brought by swarm intelligence via the Ant Colony Optimization. The cubes build environment and data attributes are used as pheromones. The designed solution is partitioned into data, cubes, links and messages. The data forms a cube environment.

This approach is illustrated through a description of a detailed conceptual case (scenario) pertaining to its application in agribusiness. This approach to decision making can be viewed as an extension of well-known techniques pertaining to DSS but also represents the opportunity to address problems not amenable to traditional post hoc analysis.

This fact has, conversely, benefited the adoption of innovative computing models such as cloud computing, which allow businesses to reduce their fixed IT costs through outsourcing. As the number of cloud services available on the Internet grows, it is more and more difficult for companies to find those that can meet their needs. Under these circumstances, enabling a semantically-enriched search engine for cloud solutions can be a major breakthrough. In this paper, we present a fully-fledged platform based on semantics that (1) assist in generating a semantic description of cloud services, and (2) provide a cloud-focused search tool that makes use of such semantic descriptions to get accurate results from keyword-based searches.

The main challenge that arises from this situation is the fact that for the same service implementation, several service descriptions are published in different service registries. Accordingly, if the service implementation is updated all of its descriptions have to be updated too over all of these registries. Otherwise, the service user may not bind to the suitableWeb service if its descriptions are inaccurate or outdated.

The basic method is addressed for periodic acoustic disturbances at first. A number of challenges such as the need for the large memory block and long convergence time have led to the establishment of some new suggestions. These modifications have improved the system performances and decreased the computational burden.

However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A manager that deals with the problem has to decide on a number of issues, such as how to simulate the consumer choice process, which optimization algorithm to apply, and how to model the competitors' retaliatory moves. The existing information systems fail to provide the decision maker with the unique blend of techniques and resources required by the problem. In order to follow the way that marketing managers comprehend the optimal product process, in this paper the problem is broken down into distinct services, each one of them maps into a basic feature (simulation, optimization, competition analysis, etc.). All services are aggregated to a marketing decision support system by a service oriented architecture, achieving this way a decision-makers friendly environment, since the marketing managers are able to get a solution without the need to transfer data and parameters from one software to another, and without the need to coordinate manually the whole process.

Additionally, most of them, recently introduced new auxiliary Business Intelligence decision support tools in order to transform their available huge amount of real operating data into timely and accurate information for their decisions. However, although both of those types of automated decision support are valuable, very few attempts were already made by researchers to integrate them into a unified tool. This paper proposes a general conceptual framework for a strategic and tactical decision support system that integrates both of these technologies, simulation and Business Intelligence, in order to enhance the overall practical interest for its usage by taking advantage of the foreseen synergy of the integration. This approach is then extended and illustrated to the case of demand responsive transport (DRT) systems. DRT systems provide transport on demand for users, using flexible schedules and routes to satisfy their travel needs. The paper discusses the potential interest of the proposed integration, identifying a set of questions that can then be answered with effectiveness and more efficiently than before. In particular, such set comprises a list of strategic and tactical issues that are of crucial importance to the design and planning of sustainable DRT systems, before its implementation, thus overcoming the current lack of analytical tools to this end. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Business intelligence; Demand responsive transport (DRT); Integrated decision support system; Operations research; What-if simulation","Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Decision support systems; Operations research; Tools; Transportation routes; Conceptual frameworks; Demand responsive transport; Demand responsive transport systems; Integrated decision; Integrated simulations; Intelligence decision; Transportation planners; What-if simulation; Management science",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886382943

In this paper, a customer trust index is designed as the trust level arising from the information sharing degree and quality, related to the information shared by a supplier with his customer. The customer trust level is evaluated using a fuzzy decision support system integrating information sharing dimensions. The core is a rule-based system designed using the results of questionnaires and interviews with supply chain experts. Several tests were generated in order to analyze the impact of the different information sharing attributes on the customer trust index. The developed approach is then applied to a real supply chain from the textile industry. Results show large differences of weight and impact between the different information-related factors that build the customer trust index.

A trend is observed towards a wider application of flexible endoscopes with an increasing role in complex intraluminal therapeutic procedures. The nonintuitive and nonergonomical steering mechanism now forms a barrier in the extension of flexible endoscope applications. Automating the navigation of endoscopes could be a solution for this problem. This paper summarizes the current state of the art in image-based navigation algorithms. The objectives are to find the most promising navigation system(s) to date and to indicate fields for further research. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using three general search terms in two medical-technological literature databases. Papers were included according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 135 papers were analyzed. Ultimately, 26 were included. Results: Navigation often is based on visual information, which means steering the endoscope using the images that the endoscope produces. Two main techniques are described: lumen centralization and visual odometry. Although the research results are promising, no successful, commercially available automated flexible endoscopy system exists to date. Conclusions: Automated systems that employ conventional flexible endoscopes show the most promising prospects in terms of cost and applicability. To produce such a system, the research focus should lie on finding low-cost mechatronics and technologically robust steering algorithms. Additional functionality and increased efficiency can be obtained through software development. The first priority is to find real-time, robust steering algorithms. These algorithms need to handle bubbles, motion blur, and other image artifacts without disrupting the steering process. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Computer vision; Flexible endoscopy; Image-based steering; NOTES","algorithm; article; artifact reduction; automation; colonoscopy; computer assisted surgery; endoscopy; fiberoscope; flexible endoscopy; human; image reconstruction; navigation system; priority journal; surgical technology; visual information; visual odometry; Algorithms; Artifacts; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Endoscopes; Equipment Design; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Motion; Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery; Pliability; Robotics; Software; Surgery, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885187096

The whole cycle view allows faster product development with more control of risks and processes. Through PLM quality and effectiveness of product development and planning can be improved. Portfolio of products can be considered rather than single products alone. Throughout the PLM phases many decision are made, and Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS) can be useful in supporting these. This is especially true where Concurrent Engineering (CE) practices are used to compress the lifecycle through parallelism and cross-functional teams. This paper argues that social media software will change many aspects of work engagement and specifically aspects of product lifecycle management processes. We investigate popular social software systems with a view to using them as group decision support systems. We discuss the functionalities and how they would be useful within decision making in terms of group decision making processes. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of various aspects of social software in decision making and conclude that social software techniques are useful within a business context, but not as they are currently implemented for social purposes. © IFAC.","Concurrent engineering; GDSS; Group decision support systems; Knowledge management; PLM; Product lifecycle management; Social software","Artificial intelligence; Concurrency control; Concurrent engineering; Decision support systems; File editors; Knowledge management; Life cycle; Process control; Product development; Business contexts; Cross-functional teams; GDSS; Group decision making process; Group decision supports; Product life cycle management; Social software; Work engagements; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884298464

Therefore, estimating the demand quantity for the next period most likely appears to be crucial. The objective of the paper is to propose a new forecasting mechanism which is modeled by artificial intelligence approaches including the comparison of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (FIS) techniques to manage the fuzzy demand with incomplete information. Artificial neural networks has been applied as it is capable to model complex, nonlinear processes without having to assume the form of the relationship between input and output variables. Neuro-fuzzy systems also utilized to harness the power of the fuzzy logic and ANNs through utilizing the mathematical properties of ANNs in tuning rule-based fuzzy systems that approximate the way human's process information.

We highlight how multiple disciplines are part of the solution, how the solution has been embedded to provide real-time advisory to planners and operators, and the challenges faced. The technology described in this paper provides real-time advisory on flow rates for individual wells and platforms to network coordination operators to achieve a gas supply that meets overall gas demand for the onshore LNG plants, maximizes revenue from condensates production and CO2 blending, and transparently shows the business value impact of giving preference to short- or long-term optimization objectives. It takes into account existing commercial and contractual constraints, as well as financial and economical elements. The optimization approach is data-driven and features multiple, mutually dependent objectives and constraints. The data-driven approach has proven significantly faster and more practicable than prior physical model-based approaches. Field trials have proven a condensate production increase of up to 7,000bbl/d while at the same time improving Ultimate Recovery of the sweet and sour gas blend of the production system by up to 2 months per 'year of applied optimizer advise'. At the same time, gas nominations are met as they were, and commercial and quality constraints are adhered to. The Return On Investment of this solution has been less than a month. This is one of the first successful attempts to implement truly-real-time optimization in a production environment of this size and complexity, including a complicated set of commercial and contractual constraints. The approach opens the door to application to a wide variety of real, complex, mixed-integer non-linear optimization problems, and their organizational application, such as emissions management and decision support systems for integrated IOR/EOR systems.",,"Artificial intelligence; Blending; Complex networks; Economics; Energy management; Gas condensates; Gas plants; Gases; Gasoline; Integer programming; Investments; Nonlinear programming; Condensate production; Data-driven approach; Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization; Network coordinations; Optimization approach; Production environments; Production Sharing Contracts; Real-time optimization; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883338394

The introduction of semantic web ensures the seamless integration of information derived from diverse sources and transforms the DSS to an adoptable and flexible SemanticWeb-DSS (Web-DSS).However, due to the monotonic nature of the layered development of semantic web, it lacks the capability to represent, reason and integrate incomplete and conflicting information. This, in turn, renders an enterprise incapable of knowledge integration; that is, integration of information about a subject that could potentially be incomplete, inconsistent and distributed among different Web-DSS within or across enterprises. In this article, we address the issues of incomplete and inconsistent semantic information and knowledge integration by using argumentation and argumentation schemes. We discuss the Argumentation-enabled Information Integration Web-DSS (Web@IDSS) along with its syntax and semantics for semantic information integration, and devise a methodology for sharing the results of Web@IDSS in Argument Interchange Format (AIF) format.

Due to the rapid growth in the volume of service repositories and services, obtaining the appropriate service is becoming tedious in the current scenario. Though advanced techniques are proposed to handle these challenges in conventional environments, still it is in its critical stage in the resource constrained scenarios, particularly in wireless mobile environments. The work presented in this paper proposes a Service Cache Management (SCM) for Mobile Peer-to-Peer (MP2P) networks to facilitate the efficient retrieval of services. We used a communication structure called Distributed Spanning Tree (DST), in which nodes of MP2P are made to form a forest of spanning trees in a distributed fashion. Using the DST structure, fast service cache and retrieval can be achieved within MP2P. Further to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed system, the DST network is optimized with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to identify the simplest path between nodes of each layer on the DST. The merits of the proposed techniques are demonstrated in terms of reduced time requirement for cached service search, increased availability, enhanced consistency, scalability and improved hit ratios. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, current implementations of 3D city models are typically LoD2 that don't include geometric or attribute details about many visible features (e.g. rooms) of a building. As such, value-added applications developed for web-based and wireless platforms are limited to querying for available non-spatial business data at the building level only. To overcome this, geometrically accurate 3D building models are necessary to enable users to visualize, interact, and query for task specific non-spatial business data.

As a result, decision-making becomes highly challenging in the alignment of decisions to support the success of business goals. Specifically, environmental management is closely related to several levels in the enterprise structure, since they share a large amount of data and information. Hence, effective integration of environmental issues by means of tools improving information sharing and communication, may play a crucial role for the enhanced enterprise operation from an environmental perspective. In this sense, knowledge management technologies have proved to be highly promising for supporting this integration task. In this work, an ontological framework is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models sharing for the environmental assessment of the enterprise. The ontological model is applied to a case study considering a supply chain network design-planning and a process scheduling problem. The ontology provides an enterprise decision-making supporting tool by combining different information systems, which adapts and recognizes the different elements associated with the enterprise functions, and facilitates assessing the environmental performance of enterprises. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the algorithm can be implemented in a biophysically based excitatory-inhibitory network model. The frequency separation process works over a range of frequencies determined by time constants of the model's intrinsic variables. It does not rely on a ""resonance"" phenomenon and is not tuned to a discrete set of frequencies.

Nowadays, this task involves only the grid operator and retail electricity providers. One of the facets of the Smart Grid vision is that consumers may have a more active role in the problem of balancing demand with supply. With the deployment of intelligent information and communication technologies in domestic environments, homes are becoming smarter and able to play a more active role in the management of energy. We use the term Smart Consumer Load Balancing to refer to algorithms that are run by energy management systems of homes in order to optimise the electricity consumption, to minimise costs and/or meet supply constraints. In this work, we analyse different approaches to Smart Consumer Load Balancing based on (distributed) artificial intelligence. We also put forward a new model of Smart Consumer Load Balancing, where consumers actively participate in the balancing of demand with supply by forming groups that agree on a joint demand profile to be contracted in the market with the mediation of an aggregator. We specify the business model as well as the optimisation model for load balancing, showing the economic benefits for the consumers in a realistic scenario based on the Spanish electricity market. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Coalitions; Load balancing; Optimisation; Smart grid","Artificial intelligence; Electric industry; Electric power utilization; Energy management systems; Power markets; Resource allocation; Smart power grids; Coalitions; Domestic environments; Electricity-consumption; Empirical evaluations; Intelligent information; Optimisations; Smart grid; Spanish electricity markets; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878578199

One of the intelligent methods to satisfy various customer demands and compete with rivals in today's business environment is to assemble diverse models on the same assembly line, simultaneously. So, mixed-model assembly line balancing problem with parallel workstations and zoning constraints is studied in this paper. Firstly, relevant studies in the literature were presented in a summary. Then, solutions have been sought with hybrid genetic algorithm that is obtained from the combination of modified Comsoal method and genetic algorithm. Computational experiments were carried out on 20 benchmark problems to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The obtained results were compared with the results of pure genetic algorithm and other previous researches. Obviously, it has been observed that proposed algorithm has promising solution capacity especially on large-sized mixedmodel assembly line balancing problems.

We propose a 3D point cloud parametrization of the 3D structure and scene flow that allows us to directly estimate the desired unknowns. A unified global energy functional is proposed to incorporate the information from the available sequences and simultaneously recover both depth and scene flow. The functional enforces multi-view geometric consistency and imposes brightness constancy and piecewise smoothness assumptions directly on the 3D unknowns. It inherently handles the challenges of discontinuities, occlusions, and large displacements. The main contribution of this work is the fusion of a 3D representation and an advanced variational framework that directly uses the available multi-view information. This formulation allows us to advantageously bind the 3D unknowns in time and space. Different from optical flow and disparity, the proposed method results in a nonlinear mapping between the images' coordinates, thus giving rise to additional challenges in the optimization process. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method successfully recovers the 3D structure and scene flow despite the complicated nonconvex optimization problem. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","3D structure; Multiple view; Scene flow","3D point cloud; 3D Structure; Brightness constancies; Global energy; Large displacements; Multi-views; Multiple views; Nonconvex optimization problem; Nonlinear mappings; Optimization process; Parametrizations; Piecewise smoothness; Scene flow; Synthetic data; Variational approaches; Variational framework; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Three dimensional computer graphics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873191031

In shape analysis the transformations are usually chosen as similarities, while in general statistical data analysis other types of transformation groups such as the affine group may be used. Generalized procrustes analysis has a nonlinear and nonconvex formulation. The classical approach alternates the computation of a so-called reference shape and the computation of transformations relating this reference shape to each shape datum in turn. We propose the stratified approach to generalized procrustes analysis. It first uses the affine transformation group to analyze the data and then upgrades the solution to the sought after group, whether Euclidean or similarity. We derive a convex formulation for each of these two steps, and efficient practical algorithms that gracefully handle missing data (incomplete shapes). Extensive experimental results show that our approaches perform well on simulated and real data.

To aid in the analysis, new segmentation techniques for identifying neurons in these feature rich datasets are required. This paper presents a method for neuron boundary detection and nonbranching process segmentation in electron microscopy images and visualizing them in three dimensions. It combines both automated segmentation techniques with a graphical user interface for correction of mistakes in the automated process. The automated process first uses machine learning and image processing techniques to identify neuron membranes that deliniate the cells in each two-dimensional section. To segment nonbranching processes, the cell regions in each two-dimensional section are connected in 3D using correlation of regions between sections. The combination of this method with a graphical user interface specially designed for this purpose, enables users to quickly segment cellular processes in large volumes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial neural networks; Connectomics; Contour completion; Filter bank; Machine learning; Membrane detection; Neural circuit reconstruction","article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; computer interface; connectome; human; image processing; methodology; nerve cell; transmission electron microscopy; ultrastructure; Artificial Intelligence; Connectome; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Neural Networks (Computer); Neurons; Pattern Recognition, Automated; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872491808

The motivation is that we often want to do business, or conduct transactions, with strangers, people we haven't done business with before. Reputation systems don't really work, or at least reputation systems for giving reputations to strangers don't work. Now most people say that that's because you don't know the people giving the reputations, I want to make the slightly stronger claim that even if you did know all the people who gave all the reputations, and you trusted them all, that still wouldn't help. This is basically because trust isn't transitive. The fact that Alice trusts Bob, and that Bob trusts Carol, isn't enough to ensure that it's appropriate for Alice to trust Carol, because the fact that Carol gives Bob a good service doesn't mean that Carol is going to give Alice a good service. It might be that Bob is a regular customer, it might be that there's some other reason why Carol's giving Bob a good service. Perhaps she fancies him. The assumption that we're going to make, for the purpose of this talk, is that local trust management is a more tractable problem than the one that we started with here. If you have people that you do business with all the time, then there are various systems that more or less allow you to do get a particular service in such a way that it's either cheap or reliable depending on which has more utility in that circumstance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Good services; Regular customers; Reputation systems; Trust management; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872448703

The ever-increasing complexities and controversial challenges in today's business environment require organizations to be recognized as adaptive systems and be examined as an evolving intelligent being. An organization is intelligent only if it is able to nurture a high level of collective intelligence. The tremendous advances in Internet and Web applications bring impetus to Web-based Group Decision Support Systems (GDSSs) development as the most recent collective intelligence systems. Based on extensive literature review, six dimensions of collective intelligence were identified in this paper. These dimensions are freedom of mind, shared memory, knowledge sharing, collective perception, collective problem-solving, and collective learning. Furthermore, the study's framework identified four major expected outcomes, involving sense and response capability, relationship quality, decision making quality, and continuous organization learning. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS.

One of the most important aspects which differentiate a cloud workflow system from its other counterparts is the market-oriented business model. This is a significant innovation which brings many challenges to conventional workflow scheduling strategies. To investigate such an issue, this paper proposes a market-oriented hierarchical scheduling strategy in cloud workflow systems. Specifically, the service-level scheduling deals with the Task-to-Service assignment where tasks of individual workflow instances are mapped to cloud services in the global cloud markets based on their functional and non-functional QoS requirements; the task-level scheduling deals with the optimisation of the Task-to-VM (virtual machine) assignment in local cloud data centres where the overall running cost of cloud workflow systems will be minimised given the satisfaction of QoS constraints for individual tasks. Based on our hierarchical scheduling strategy, a package based random scheduling algorithm is presented as the candidate service-level scheduling algorithm and three representative metaheuristic based scheduling algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimisation (ACO), and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) are adapted, implemented and analysed as the candidate task-level scheduling algorithms. The hierarchical scheduling strategy is being implemented in our SwinDeW-C cloud workflow system and demonstrating satisfactory performance. Meanwhile, the experimental results show that the overall performance of ACO based scheduling algorithm is better than others on three basic measurements: the optimisation rate on makespan, the optimisation rate on cost and the CPU time. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cloud computing; Cloud workflow system; Hierarchical scheduling; Metaheuristics; Workflow scheduling","Ant colony optimisation; Business models; Cloud data; Cloud services; CPU time; Distributed applications; Global clouds; Hierarchical scheduling; Makespan; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Non-functional; Optimisations; Particle swarm optimisation; QoS constraints; QoS requirements; Running cost; Virtual machines; Work-flow systems; Workflow scheduling; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Commerce; Computer systems; Hierarchical systems; Parallel architectures; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Work simplification; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872360361

First, the WFD-Explorer toolbox analysed the effect of different restoration options on the abiotic river characteristics based on the water and substance balance embedded in the simulation environment. Based on these abiotic characteristics, the biological index Biological Monitoring Working Party for Vietnam was then predicted by classification trees that were trained on biological and abiotic data collected in the Du river basin in northern Vietnam. The ecological status of streams in the basin ranged from nearly pristine headwaters to severely impacted river stretches. Elimination of point sources from ore extraction and decentralised domestic wastewater treatment proved to be the most effective measures to improve the ecological condition of the Du river basin. The combination of the WFD-Explorer results with data-driven models enabled model application in a situation where expert knowledge was lacking.

Our method complements and details the On-To-Knowledge methodology during its ontology development phase. The essential point of our method is to make it easy to develop an EDMS for quality standards by means of an ontology-based system. The OntoDocMan method is illustrated by a case study for developing an ontology based on the ISO/TS 16949, which is a Technical Specification (TS) and we show that the Ontology system is friendly and easy to use as any EDMS. Different from common EDMS, our ontology-based EDMS is developed without any programming.

An important factor that affects revenues is the ability to conclude profitable deals with different travel suppliers. However, the profitability of a contract not only depends on the communication skills of a contract manager. It significantly depends on the objective information obtained about a specific travel supplier and his/her products. While the contract manager usually has a broad knowledge of the travel business in general, collecting and processing specific information about travel suppliers is usually a time and cost expensive task. Our goal is to develop a tool that assists the travel intermediate to acquire the missing strategic information about individual hotels in order to leverage profitable deals. We present a GIS-based decision support system that can both, estimate objective hotel room rates using essential hotel and locational characteristics and predict temporal room rate prices. Information about objective hotel room rates allows for an objective comparison and provides the basis for a realistic computation of the contract's profitability. The temporal prediction of room rates can be used for monitoring past hotel room rates and for adjusting the price of the future contract. This paper makes three major contributions. First, we present a GIS-based decision support system, the first of its kind, for hotel brokers. Second, the DSS can be applied to virtually any part of the world, which makes it a very attractive business tool in real-life situations. Third, it integrates a widely used data mining framework that provides access to dozens of ready to run algorithms to be used by a domain expert and it offers the possibility of adding new algorithms once they are developed. The system has been designed and evaluated in close cooperation with a company that develops travel technology solutions, in particular inventory management and pricing solutions for many well-known websites and travel agencies around the world. This company has also provided us with real, large datasets to evaluate the system. We demonstrate the functionality of the DSS using the hotel data in the area of Barcelona, Spain.

One way to generate wind velocity is from the fifth generation PENN/NCAR MM5 mesoscale model. However, there is a problem in using wind speed data in hydrological processes due to large errors obtained from the mesoscale model MM5. The theme of this article has been focused on hybridization of MM5 with four mathematical models (two regression models- the multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonlinear regression (NLR), and two artificial intelligence models - the artificial neural network (ANN) and the support vector machines (SVMs)) in such a way so that the properly modelled schemes reduce the wind speed errors with the information from other MM5 derived hydro-meteorological parameters. The forward selection method was employed as an input variable selection procedure to examine the model generalization errors. The input variables of this statistical analysis include wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure, solar radiation and rainfall from the MM5. The proposed conjunction structure was calibrated and validated at the Brue catchment, Southwest of England. The study results show that relatively simple models like MLR are useful tools for positively altering the wind speed time series obtaining from the MM5 model. The SVM based hybrid scheme could make a better robust modelling framework capable of capturing the non-linear nature than that of the ANN based scheme. Although the proposed hybrid schemes are applied on error correction modelling in this study, there are further scopes for application in a wide range of areas in conjunction with any higher end models. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial neural network (ANN); Input variable selection; Linear and non-linear regression; Meteorology and hydrology; MM5 dynamical downscaling; Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model; Support vector machine (SVM)","Boundary layers; Catchments; Error correction; Linear regression; Neural networks; Speed; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Weather forecasting; Dynamical downscaling; Input variable selection; Meteorological parameters; Multiple linear regressions; Non-linear regression; Numerical weather prediction models; Support vector machine (SVMs); Wind speed time series; Wind; artificial neural network; downscaling; error correction; hydrometeorology; mesoscale meteorology; multiple regression; numerical model; weather forecasting; wind velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871434368

In wireless ad hoc networks, energy utilization is perhaps the most important issue, routing is very much energy-constrained. In this paper, an ant-based energy efficient routing protocol (AEERP) is proposed in MANETs. In AEERP routing protocol, the route choice is dependent on not only hops between nodes, but also the energy consumed in transmitting packets and the residual energy of nodes, it increases the battery lifetime of the nodes by reducing the repetitive use of these nodes. Simulation results show that AEERP can balance the energy consumption of nodes in the network and extends the network lifetime. AEERP has better performance than AntHocNet and MMBCR in balanced energy use and network lifetime. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Ant colony optimization; Energy efficiency; Mobile ad hoc network; Routing protocols","Ant based routing; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Balanced energy; Battery lifetime; Energy efficient routing protocol; Energy efficient use; Energy-constrained; Network lifetime; Residual energy; Route choice; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Information technology; Routing protocols; Mobile ad hoc networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870845767

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how PHM can support effective execution of some PSS contracts and to set out the future research agenda for the development of an online simulation modelling framework that will further harness the interaction between PHM and PSS. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology commenced by collating facts and figures from the existing body of knowledge, from which a set of key findings is presented from both technical and business perspectives. Analysis of the key findings highlights the current state of PHM-PSS interaction, the capability of existing tools and techniques and a comprehensive analysis of PSS performances, with and without PHM. Findings - Increased demand for total asset performance from the customers has been the main driver for PSS providers to adopt PHM technology. In the case of high value assets, PHM is used to capture the condition of the assets and to feed this information back to the PSS operations management which, in turn, will be used to plan a maintenance regime, spare parts provision, as well as to mitigate the dynamic behaviour which commonly occurs in PSS. Simulation modelling, driven by asset health condition, shows a considerable potential as an effective tool to control the execution of the PSS contract. In addition to the benefits from the maintenance services, the PHM-PSS interaction can increase the controllability of the PSS contract execution and allow future modifications to PSS contracts. Originality/value - The value of this paper lies in the comprehensive analysis of the interaction between PHM and PSS, especially focusing on the interaction during the PSS contract execution. This paper demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of existing research in the research domain, and highlights the opportunities for future research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Decision support systems; Dynamic behaviour; Online simulation; Operations management; Product-service systems; Prognostics and health management","Dynamic behaviours; Online simulation; Operations management; Product-service systems; Prognostics and health managements; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Maintenance; Systems engineering; Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870496148

Additionally, multiple but conflicting objectives are usually considered when a manager plans the production scheduling. Compared to the single objective problem, the multiple-objective version no longer looks for an individual optimal solution, but a Pareto front consisting of a set of non-dominated solutions will be needed and established. The manager then can select one of the alternatives from the set. This research aims at employing a variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm and a multiple ant colony optimization (MACO) algorithm to solve the identical parallel-machine scheduling problem with two conflicting objectives: makespan and total tardiness. In VNS, two neighborhoods are defined - insert a job to a different position or swap two jobs in the sequence. To save the computational expense, one of the neighborhoods is randomly selected for the target solution which is also arbitrarily chosen from the current Pareto front. In MACO, a two-phase construction procedure where three colonies are employed in each phase is proposed. These two algorithms are tested on a set of real data collected from a leading PCB factory in Taiwan and their performances are compared. The computational results show that VNS outperforms all competing algorithms - SPGA, MOGA, NSGA-II, SPEA-II, and MACO in terms of solution quality and computational time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) are also sometimes referred to as Decision Support Systems due to the fact that they provide support to users and organisations concerning their decision making. Without a doubt, BI is extremely vital for all organisations in today's competitive business environment where even the smallest detail could affect the future of an organization. The study of BI is of interest to Computer Science (CS) and possibly the related Computer Engineering majors as well as Management Information Systems (MIS) and in broad to Business Studies majors. A course on BI is not usually a major requirement in any one of these curriculums, and it may not even appear as a major elective but rather be included in some other related course. For example, in the CS undergraduate university curriculum the topic of Business Intelligence may be touched upon briefly in a course on Database Management and in the graduate CS curriculum it usually becomes part of a Knowledge Management course. In the undergraduate (MIS) curriculum some additional mentioning is usually made in an Information Systems course. The brief coverage of the topic and the absence of simple and inexpensive educational tools that could easily explore the role of BI to students do not allow the educator to stress the magnitude of BI.

We provide a comparative approach for optimal business process flow selection and resource allocation using two of the most important bio-inspired meta-heuristics: Ant Colony Optimization and Bee Colony Optimization. Our approach does not use predefined rules for making the decisions when selecting the flow in the business process model. Given a business process, our approach starts from the business goal and reconstructs the optimal process flow by going backwards in the process in an iterative manner and solving everything that needs to be done for that goal to be completed. This reconstruction is realized by combining the bio-inspired algorithms with resource allocation strategies. The bio-inspired optimizations have been comparatively evaluated on a set of manufacturing scenarios. © 2012 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; Bee Colony Optimization; Business process optimization; resource allocation","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Bio-inspired; Bio-inspired algorithms; Business goals; Business Process; Business process flows; Business process model; Business process optimization; Colony optimization; Comparative approach; Meta heuristics; Optimal process; Resource allocation strategies; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Communication; Computer resource management; Iterative methods; Process control; Resource allocation; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871563131

Due to ad hoc additions from diverse business units over time, the IT resources in a DC get unwieldy and complex. Transformations of DC - server consolidation, migration, application/data simplification, technology standardization - are important for cost, efficiency and reliability. Even when a specific transformation is identified (""consolidate these 100 existing servers into these 48 new servers"") it is difficult to generate a detailed optimal project plan for its execution. The project plan must identify all the tasks involved, identify an optimal team (size and expertise) and generate a detailed work schedule that meets the and respects the constraints and dependencies among the tasks. We present a methodology to generate such a plan automatically from given ""high-level"" IT transformation specifications (""as-is"" and ""to-be"" states). We adopt a heuristic forward chaining metric temporal planner engine (SAPA) to generate a project plan that attempts to optimize the overall time and team-size. The idea is to capture the domain-knowledge as reusable planning action. This automation reduces the efforts and errors in manual project planning. The method can be extended to projects in other domains. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Business units; Data centers; Efficiency and reliability; IT resources; Metric temporal planners; Project planning; Project plans; Server consolidation; Technology standardization; Work schedules; Artificial intelligence; Optimization; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871359250

However, while enhancements in data generation, storage, modelling, dissemination, and the related integration of global economies and societies are fast transforming the way we live and interact, the resulting dynamic, globalised, information society remains digitally divided. On the African continent in particular, this division has resulted in a gap between the knowledge generation and its transformation into tangible products and services. This paper proposes some fundamental approaches for a sustainable transformation of data into knowledge for the purpose of improving the people's quality of life. Its main strategy is based on a generic data sharing model providing access to data utilising and generating entities in a multi-disciplinary environment. It highlights the great potentials in using unsupervised and supervised modelling in tackling the typically predictive-in-nature challenges we face. Using both simulated and real data, the paper demonstrates how some of the key parameters may be generated and embedded in models to enhance their predictive power and reliability. The paper's conclusions include a proposed implementation framework setting the scene for the creation of decision support systems capable of addressing the key issues in society. It is expected that a sustainable data flow will forge synergies among the private sector, academic, and research institutions within and among countries. It is also expected that the paper's findings will help in the design and development of knowledge extraction from data in the wake of cloud computing and, hence, contribute towards the improvement in the people's overall quality of life. To avoid running high implementation costs, selected open source tools are recommended for developing and sustaining the system.","Cloud computing; Data mining; Digital divide; Globalisation; Knowledge transfer partnership; Predictive modelling and science technology and innovation (KTP)","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Metadata; Open systems; Societies and institutions; Sustainable development; Design and Development; Digital divide; Globalisation; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge generations; Knowledge transfer; Research institutions; Science technologies; Data mining",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871872752

Often a change in one of these components requires changes in many of the dependent components. Similarly, an analysis of some system properties requires knowledge about other system parts than just the mashup. Such features could be implemented using the model-driven development (MDD) approach, but existing MDD approaches for mashups concentrate on modeling and execution only. To remedy this problem, we propose a generic approach based on a UML2 profile which can easily be extended to model other system parts or integrated with other existing models.

Recently, several methodologies have been proposed for the reuse of components and software assets, but mainly in code generation as artifacts. However, these methodologies partially consider the domain analysis, business process modeling, and reuse software in the software development environment in order to promote productivity and quality in application development. This paper introduces a metaprocess-oriented methodology for the reuse of metaprocesses as software assets starting from specifications and analysis of the domain. The proposed methodology includes the definition of a conceptual level to adequately represent the domain, a structural level to specify the metaprocess as software assets, and an implementation level which defines the rules for instantiation and reuse of metaprocess as software assets. The methodology has been applied successfully to the first phase, i.e. at the specification of the conceptual level and design of applications in the field of e-health, in particular in monitoring systems of patients with cardiovascular risk. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","E-health; Metaprocess; Processes; Reuse","Application development; Business process modeling; Cardiovascular risk; Code Generation; Conceptual levels; Domain analysis; Ehealth; Meta-process; Monitoring system; Processes; Reuse; Software assets; Software development environment; Artificial intelligence; Health risks; Specifications; Systems engineering; Ubiquitous computing; Computer software reusability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870340112

In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review of aspect-oriented approaches for business process adaptation. We observe that current methods focus on i) composing and swapping services based on Quality of Service (QoS), cost, rules, policies, and constraints, as well as in the event of failure, ii) extracting roles and crosscutting concerns from composite serviing and adaptation framework is novel because none of the other approaches considers organization goals, performance and constraints as a whole when improving business processes.

Most SCIs are built using statistical measures, but the jury is still out regarding their accuracy and effectiveness. This paper is proposing an alternative approach to build a new breed or 3rd Generation Intelligent Synthetic Composite Indicators (3G iSCi) based on computational intelligent methods. The suggested approach utilizes Fuzzy Proximity Knowledge Mining to build the qualitative taxonomy, and Fuzzy C-Means will be used to form the 3G iSCi. It is suggested to cluster related dataset for every single country and detect a cluster centre to act as the aggregated index for that country, which would identify natural homogeneously grouped data, allowing for concise representation of the relationships embedded within the variables. To illustrate, this research uses real variables and data to build a new Unified Intelligent ICT Index (U3I) based on the suggested soft computing methods. The results obtained so far are compared against Principal Components/Factor Analysis (PC/FA), and the Geometric Aggregation (GME), which are widely used statistical methods to weight and aggregate SCIs. The robustness of both techniques are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation.

Adjusting the duration of the load, reaction and discharge phases, it allows to optimize the treatment, saving time and energy. Optimal policies can be defined by observing and analyzing some chemical and physical parameters such as pH, redox potential and dissolved oxygen concentration. Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been proposed and used to recognize the state of the biological processes inside the plant, using the signals' trends and changes as indirect indicators. In particular, the termination of a process (typically, denitrification in the anoxic phase or nitrification in the aerobic one) can be estimated by a management system and used in control policies. In this paper, we point out that this recognition task is only part of the responsibilities of a potential Environmental Decision Support System (EDSS) managing an SBR, and by no means the only one which can take advantage of AI techniques. In fact, the entire control and management system could be defined and implemented using declarative AI techniques, deployed within a uniform execution environment. In particular, we propose two alternative but similar models of the SBR operation cycles: one is based on workflows, exploiting the BPMN2 (Business Process Management Notation v.2) standard for the definition and execution of business processes; the other instead is founded on the principles of (Reactive) Event Calculus. Both representation capture the operational behavior of the SBR, supporting the state transitions and the actions associated to each state. The transitions themselves are driven by events, i.e. relevant state changes. The events are identified either directly, through the sensor system installed on the plant, or analysing a combination of other more elementary events, and conditioned by the actual state of the plant. The correlations between events, states and control actions, as well as their consequences, will eventually be defined using rules, which will also encode the necessary knowledge to deal with exceptional conditions, accounting for a more flexible system.","Business process; Event calculus; Sequencing batch reactors",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894145514

It is of vital importance to provide for company continuous financial analyses to identify factors of market fluctuations or even threats of possible market exclusion. From the point of view of economic theory, as well as its practical applications, it is necessary to coordinate collection, allocation and efficient exploitation of production factors due to their limitations. In fact this trend is the raison d'être of economic behaviour. Limited resources make their efficient utilisation necessary. The optimum decision-making of company managers is a must. The decision on financial resources and their optimum utilization is a prerequisite for functioning off any business or economy. The modern theory and practice of financial management cannot do without mathematical, statistical and econometric tools. To be able to provide for efficient decisions, managers need economic theory and methods of economic analyses. Modelling serves the purpose of understanding complex phenomena of actual existence. These phenomena are often so complicated that modelling represents the only way, how their behaviour can be studied. The current econometrics would be impracticable without application of mathematics and statistics. The quantitative analyses attest or refute the hypotheses as outcome of qualitative reasoning. If a quantitative analysis is acceptable, it can be utilized for the development of variance scenarios, and qualified prognosis formulation. The issue of optimal financing is a topical theme of frequent debate concerning financial theory and practice of industrial enterprises in this country. The principal reason for choosing just this subject is the fact that presently there exists no comprehensive review of ways of financing technical equipment of production, inclusive provision suitable optimum modelling that could direct to optimum mode of financing such equipment. Both an appropriate theory and practical model is lacking. The paper's objective is to assess the status quo of investment financing in the Czech Republic, as well as abroad and subsequently provide for a mathematical (abstract) model, which would enable optimizing payments of technical equipment costs. © SGEM2012 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM Published by STEF92 Technology Ltd.","Costs; Finance resources; Financing; Modelling; Optimizing","Financial managements; Financing; Industrial enterprise; Market fluctuations; Optimizing; Production equipments; Qualitative reasoning; Technical equipments; Artificial intelligence; Chemical analysis; Costs; Economics; Equipment; Exhibitions; Industry; International trade; Management; Managers; Models; Optimization; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890823434

In other words, we all gossip. Although sometimes a contentious topic, various researchers have shown gossip to be fundamental to social life-from small groups to large, formal organizations. In this paper, we present the first study of gossip in a large CMC corpus. Adopting the Enron email dataset and natural language techniques, we arrive at four main findings. First, workplace gossip is common at all levels of the organizational hierarchy, with people most likely to gossip with their peers. Moreover, employees at the lowest level play a major role in circulating it. Second, gossip appears as often in personal exchanges as it does in formal business communication. Third, by deriving a power-law relation, we show that it is more likely for an email to contain gossip if targeted to a smaller audience. Finally, we explore the sentiment associated with gossip email, finding that gossip is in fact quite often negative: 2.7 times more frequent than positive gossip.

A deceptive business entity that hires people to write fake reviews will necessarily distort its distribution of review scores, leaving distributional footprints behind. In order to validate this hypothesis, we introduce strategies to create dataset with pseudo-gold standard that is labeled automatically based on different types of distributional footprints. A range of experiments confirm the hypothesized connection between the distributional anomaly and deceptive reviews.

For some respondents, these sites had become indispensable tools as they were integrated into everyday routines of communicating with emotionally important and proximal contacts and were often used for coordination of offline activities. For others social network sites remained spaces where they occasionally visited with people who may have been important at some point in the past but who had little connection to the daily business of living. In these cases social network sites were seen as convenient spaces of lightweight connectivity, but by no means indispensable.

In the business intelligence application domain of credit scoring, they have been shown to be effective tools for distinguishing between good credit risks and bad credit risks. The accuracy obtained by these two techniques is often higher than that from decision tree methods. Unlike decision tree methods, however, the classifications made by ANN and SVM are difficult to understand by the end-users as outputs from ANN and SVM are computed as nonlinear mapping of the input data attributes. We describe two rule extraction methods that we have developed to overcome this difficulty. These rule extraction methods enable the users to obtain comprehensible propositional rules from ANN and SVM. Such rules can be easily verified by the domain experts and would lead to a better understanding about the data in hand. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885660668

Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), one of the well known Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, has already proven its effectiveness in numerous studies. However, due to the uncertainties in knowledge representation, attribute description, and similarity measures in CBR, it's very difficult to find the similar cases from case bases. In order to deal with this problem, fuzzy theories have been incorporated into CBR allowing for more flexible and accurate models. This research develops a hybrid model by integrating Self Organization Map (SOM) neural network for data clustering, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for parameters optimization and Weighted Fuzzy CBR (WFCBR) as main forecasting model to forecast the future sales in a printed circuit board (PCB) factory. This hybrid model encompasses two novel concepts: 1. Clustering WFCBR into different clusters by adopting SOM, thus the interaction between WFCBR is reduced and a higher accurate prediction model can be established. 2. Evolving WFCBR by optimizing the variables weights and fuzzy term numbers of the inputs and outputs, thus the prediction accuracy of the WFCBR can be further improved. Numerical data of various affecting factors and actual demand of 5 years of the PCB factory are collected and fed into the hybrid model for future monthly sales forecasting. Experimental results show the forecasting accuracy is obtained by the proposed hybrid model and it is superiors to the other comparing methods. © 2012 AICIT.","Forecasting; Fuzzy CBR; Genetic Algorithm; SOM","Casebased reasonings (CBR); Fuzzy cbr; Genetic algorithm (GAs); Parameters optimization; Printed circuit boards (PCB); Quality of business strategy; Self-organization maps; SOM; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Knowledge representation; Optimization; Organic pollutants; Sales; Genetic algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881184027

Organizations use various Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications to support their functions in planning, manufacturing, sales, marketing, customer relationships, finance, human resource management, supply chain and logistics, e-business and other similar functions. This leads to handling of very large datasets which may be stored in distributed and discrete manner. These organizations make decisions based on the reports generated from such databases. Although, organizations maintain an ERP system that automates the business processes and generate reports, the report may still have issues with its completeness. This paper attempts to discuss and address the following areas of concerns: a) Localization invariably results in challenges during report generation and data consolidation. b) The scope of the customized reports is limited to the requirement specified by the organization at a point in time of ERP implementation, and the organization may have to entail additional efforts (efforts involve additional costs) to ensure the reports remain current. c) During data migration, manual data mapping and translation for database is involved to a greater extent. This paper recommends an approach that could be adopted by the ERP application vendors to handle the variations in data with the use of recent technologies and thus, attempt to address the above issues by offering field level data transliteration as an Out of the box feature (OOTB). © 2012 IEEE.","Data Management; ERP Applications; GUI; localization; Multi-lingual; Out of the box; Reports; Transliteration","localization; Multi-lingual; Out of the box; Reports; Transliteration; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Competition; Graphical user interfaces; Human resource management; Information management; Linguistics; Public relations; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Enterprise resource planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877934794

To avoid catastrophic consequences, a holistic view, which captures the dynamic interactions between liquidity and other financial variables, should be taken to help banks make business decisions. However, few studies in the literature have addressed this problem. To fill the research gap, we present a Systemic decision making approach for Liquidity Risk Management (SLRM) as a more advanced alternative to Conventional Liquidity Risk Management (CLRM) by capturing dynamic factors, offering logic visibility, and considering rare but fatal events. We show that SLRM can be used to support managerial decisions in developing contingency plans for liquidity management. SLRM is validated by using real data from Washington Mutual, a US bank failed during the 2008 financial tsunami. Further, we demonstrate that SLRM can also help banks conform to regulatory changes in Basel III. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Financial decision support system; Liquidity risk management; System dynamics; System thinking","Catastrophic consequences; Dynamic interaction; Financial decision support systems; Financial variables; Liquidity risk; Managerial decision; System Dynamics; System thinkings; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Finance; Information systems; Risk management; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877883980

One can figure out that business requirements for software change management depend on specific business functions, industry, technologies and so on. This is true for the IT needs of logistics as well. With the existence of supply chain management, strong needs for a solid IT background came to life. These needs cover the fields of data mining, advanced business intelligence tools, and the move towards cloud computing and mobile devices as well. After overviewing some of the basic elements and challenges of supply change management, this paper tries to analyse two widespread ERPs, SAP and Dynamics AX, and compare them from logistics point of view.

The transformation process relies on the Enhanced-Entity Relationship model. The tool validates the data and reports invalid data to the users. From the tool development, the OWL2 language has rich syntax and hence transformation of the relational database data into OWL2 is convenient.

One way to do this efficiently is to focus primarily on the most influential actors in the system. However, identifying such users becomes increasingly hard with systems where there is a continuously growing large user base. We show that analysis and explanation of influence on the cross-community level is a promising way to provide a coarse-grained picture of a potentially very large system and that it may enable its stakeholders to find groups through which the system can be efficiently influenced, or it can help them to identify and avoid activity considered as malicious.

We then design a timeline action network based on Web Ontology Language (OWL). By using the proposed activity extraction approach, we can automatically collect data for the action network. Finally, we propose a novel action-based collaborative filtering, which predicts missing activity data, in order to complement this timeline network. Moreover, with a combination of collaborative filtering and natural language processing (NLP), our method can deal with minority actions such as successful actions. Based on evaluation of tweets which related to the massive Tohoku earthquake, we indicated that our timeline action network can provide useful action patterns in real-time.

However, epidemiological studies have not paid much attention to the role of this subpopulation in disease spread. In the present work, we extend a synthetic population model of Washington DC metro area to include leisure and business travelers. This approach involves combining Census data, activity surveys, and geospatial data to build a detailed minute-by-minute simulation of population interaction. We simulate a flu-like disease outbreak both with and without the transient population to evaluate the effect of the transients on outbreak size and peak day in terms of number of residents infected. Results show that there are significantly more infections when transients are considered. We also evaluate interventions like closing big museums and encouraging use of hand sanitizers at those museums. Surprisingly, closing museums does not result in a significant difference in the epidemic. However, we find that if the use of hand sanitizers reduces the infectivity and susceptibility to 80% or 60% of the original values, it is as effective as closing museums for a few days or entirely eliminating the effect of transients. If infectivity and susceptibility are reduced to 40% or 20%, it reduces the number of resident infections over the period of 120 days by 10% and 13%.

Given the unstructured nature of the content inside the platform, a key issue for the participants is to search for and retrieve content. To address this challenge, social platforms typically allow their participants to tag and thematize content. The platform then uses the tags and themes to facilitate content search and retrieval. However, platform participants do not always tag and themetize their content, and when they do, the tags and themes can often be incomplete or misleading. A robust and accurate tagging and themetization system that will support the search and retrieval capabilities is critical to the platform. We provide a keyword and key phrase extraction technique based on term co-occurrences that performs better than traditional tfidf-based techniques. The extracted keywords and key phrases are used to construct a semantics graph.

While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration. Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business management. © 2012 AI Access Foundation.",,"Action spaces; Business management; Complex transitions; Continuous state; Exploration techniques; High-dimensional; Robust behavior; Trial-and-error process; Artificial intelligence; Reinforcement learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875199879

The range of value associated with each feature vector is divided into a number of equal parts to define six dimensional sub-space grids. A recursive procedure is then used to obtain rules where sub-space grids form premises of rules. The system is tested on a dataset of 20 images (5 images of each business object type).

The current macroeconomic frame, especially adverse in the case of Spain, makes this kind of methodologies have a warm welcome among companies, either public or private ones, since they are seen as having important chances to save money. The aim is definitely to take some measures to cut not only general costs in the usual outsourcing field, but also operation and core processes costs, following mostly the modern BPO. Moreover, a new economic activity is generated around BPO, which can be interesting for the Spanish strategic consultancy firms. At this time, the limited development of BPO can be determined, to a certain extent, by the little confidence clients have giving ""sovereignty"" when they make their strategic decisions. Anyway, this kind of initial reluctances are hoped to be saved as time goes by and with the generalization of this sort of practices in all sectors and geographic environments. Some aspects like economies of scale and the consequent obtaining of minor costs or the know-how of the companies which provide this kind of services that could even produce an increase in the chapter of incomes based on economies of scope make that BPO clients think at least of the possibility of including them in some of their processes and sub-processes. Finally, this research makes a brief observation about the relation between BPO and the so-called Offshoring, by which growing companies or simply those eager to enhance their income statement accounts, can relocate their productive processes by means of costs.","Business Process Outsourcing; Core business; Offshoring; Outsourcing process; Subcontracting","Business process outsourcing; Core business; Economies of scale; European companies; Off-shoring; Productive process; Strategic decisions; Subcontracting; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Economics; Industry; Management science; Technology transfer; Outsourcing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875167158

Tens of millions of users login to social media sites like Twitter to disseminate breaking news and share their opinions and thoughts. For businesses, social media is potentially useful for monitoring the public perception and the social reputation of companies and products. Despite great potential, how bad news about a company influences the public sentiments in social media has not been studied in depth. The aim of this study is to assess people's sentiments in Twitter upon the spread of two types of information: corporate bad news and a CEO's apology. We attempted to understand how sentiments on corporate bad news propagate in Twitter and whether any social network feature facilitates its spread. We investigated the Domino's Pizza crisis in 2009, where bad news spread rapidly through social media followed by an official apology from the company. Our work shows that bad news spreads faster than other types of information, such as an apology, and sparks a great degree of negative sentiments in the network. However, when users converse about bad news repeatedly, their negative sentiments are softened. We discuss various reactions of users towards the bad news in social media such as negative purchase intent.

The model extends NYOP to the pattern of name-your-own-desire (NYOD). And the optimal policies of buyer and sellers in NYOD are studies. Finally, a case demonstrates feasibility and high efficiency of our model. © 2012 IEEE.","High timeliness commodity; Multi-attribute auction; Name-your-own-price; Optimal policies","Auction mechanisms; Business models; High timeliness commodity; Multi-attribute auction; Multi-attribute decisions; Multi-attributes; Multiple attributes; Name-your-own-price; Optimal game strategies; Optimal policies; Reverse auction; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874581478

A framework is being proposed based on Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety and Stafford Beer's Viable Systems Model. Software is an artifact requiring large-scale human effort. IT is unlike other engineering industries because it produces non-material products. IT employs skilled intellectual workforce (that works with, and produces, ideas). IT is unlike other intellectual workforce intensive industries, such as the newspaper business or the entertainment industry because the ideas it produces actually control machines, that is to say that these ideas are formal, precise and unambiguous, and not open to interpretation[1]. Given this complex characteristic of the IT industry, we need to see if the organizations are equipped to support the building blocks, i.e. the Human Resources of this complex industry adequately. Dealing with the needs of such resources in IT services business environment through appropriate Human Resource interventions is a challenge. It is difficult to comprehend and deal with this complexity. While some can be managed by introducing appropriate processes, others may require Systemic Structural Interventions. The author proposes to use concepts from the field of Cybernetics to address the complexity. Variety, the cybernetic measure for complexity is being proposed along with System 3 and System 4 of the Viable Systems Model as key functions for Structural Interventions. © 2012 IEEE.","Complexity; Cybernetics; Human Resources; IT Services Organizations; Knowledge; Law of Requisite Variety; Measure of Variety; Software; Viable Systems Model","Complexity; IT services; Knowledge; Law of Requisite Variety; Measure of Variety; Viable systems models; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Cybernetics; Personnel; Societies and institutions; Information technology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874570778

Organizations often face difficulties when building the IT system based on SOA. The most common problem is poor reliability including service qualities and performance issues. In this article, we propose solutions to the problems described and merge them into a comprehensive architectural model for the reliable services provision in SOA. In order to overcome problems related to poor reliability, our architectural model requires the use of adjusted ESB (Enterprise Service Bus). Furthermore, we propose that all data transfer between web services and backend goes in form of TO (Transactional Objects), which are accessed by transactions in distributed transactional memory and allow us a uniform data access and manipulation, regardless of the data source. As the best approach to improve performances of the data access, our model introduces caching in the system binding with TOs. The proposed model is also loosely coupled, which means that the organizations can use only parts of the whole solution that correspond to their specific needs. © 2012 IEEE.","ACID; Cache; Distributed transactional memory; ESB; Idempotency; Performance; Reliability; SOA","Cache; ESB; Idempotency; Performance; SOA; Transactional memory; Acids; Artificial intelligence; Data transfer; Information services; Reliability; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Storage allocation (computer)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873396264

Process-oriented organizations need to do it, in addition, in accordance to the business processes their members participate in. However, powerful mechanisms to manage responsibility in combination with business processes are missing in current modelling notations, usually limited to indicating who is in charge of undertaking the activities. RACI matrices, on the contrary, were specifically conceived to provide responsibility management information. They enable the specification of the level of responsibility each human resource has with regard to each activity carried out in a company, ranging from the performer of the work to the resource that must approve it or receive certain notifications. In this paper, we propose the use of RACI matrices together with business process models to manage human resource responsibilities in processes. Focused on a concrete type of RACI matrices, called RASCI, we introduce a novel approach to automatically generate a BPMN model with RASCI information given a BPMN model that does not handle resources, and a RASCI matrix. The resulting model is BPMN-compliant and, thus, it is ready to be executed in existing business process management systems. With this approach, the assignment of responsibilities and the management of processes can be designed separately, while being executed together. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","RACI matrix; RACI-aware BPMN model; RASCI meta model; RASCI sub-process; Responsibility management","Business Process; Business process management systems; Business process model; Concrete types; In-process; Management information; Meta model; Process-oriented; RASCI sub-process; Resource assignment; Artificial intelligence; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872783255

Given a process model exposed to risks, e.g. a financial process exposed to the risk of approval fraud, we enact this process and as soon as the likelihood of the associated risk(s) is no longer tolerable, we generate a set of possible mitigation actions to reduce the risks' likelihood, ideally annulling the risks altogether. A mitigation action is a sequence of controlled changes applied to the running process instance, taking into account a snapshot of the process resources and data, and the current status of the system in which the process is executed. These actions are proposed as recommendations to help process administrators mitigate process-related risks as soon as they arise.

Unlike procedural languages, where the models define what is to be done, a declarative model specifies what behaviour is not allowed, using constraints on process events. In this paper, we study how to support configurability in such a declarative setting. We take Declare as an example of a declarative process modelling language and introduce Configurable Declare. Configurability is achieved by using configuration options for event hiding and constraint omission. We illustrate our approach using a case study, based on process models of ten Dutch municipalities.

Many of applications on cloud deals with huge amount of data and these are often used for analytical processing to exploit the business intelligence. However working with very large scale of data is often time consuming and requires higher processing time. Materialized views are built and maintained to pre-fetch an effective subset of the entire database for current and immediate future usage. The materialized views are constructed on data warehouse, data marts and virtual data warehouse. In a cloud computing scenario, quite often the materialized views for the distributed data centers resides in different data servers. One of the major challenges is to handle multiple OLAP data sources. The data needs to be, integrated and analyzed continually in an efficient manner before the views are built.

They have many applications in commercial decision support. The point of this paper is to provide an overview of the techniques involved from this perspective. We will proceed by giving a simplified mathematical overview of what Bayesian networks are and the flavors they come in. We then look at how they can be created or learnt from data and the situations that lead to the use of ensemble models. Then we look at how an application of such a technology would proceed, using the human resources example of talent retention for international firms in China, examining the full process rather than technology specific elements. Finally we look at the outputs that would be generated from such an application. © 2012 Polish Info Processing Socit.","Bayesian networks; business analytics; decision assistance; stochastic modeling","Business analytics; Commercial decisions; decision assistance; Ensemble models; International firms; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Decision support systems; Information systems; Stochastic models; Bayesian networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872533163

As case study is used Business Intelligence System for Investors, where data comes from different sources different levels, structured and unstructured. This approach has three phases: creating spatial data warehouse, implementing ETL (extract, transform and load) procedure for data from different sources (spatial and non-spatial) and, finally, designing interface for performing data analysis. The fact, that this is a public site, where users are not known in advanced and not trained, calls for importance of usability design and self-evident interface.

This system, called EDS (Expert Diagnostic System), is based on the utilization of simple sensors with the aim of acquiring the most significant parameters from various substation equipments. In order to automatically schedule the maintenance activities, the system transmits signals' trends and logic signals to a central computer. In addition, any further controls with dedicated instruments could be programmed depending on the information received. The selected monitoring parameters of each equipment are the following: - Circuit Breakers: • Operating times (via auxiliary devices already present in Terna's switches); • Number of operation (via auxiliary contacts devices already present in Terna's switches); • Sum of the interrupted currents (via the current transformers in Terna's facilities); • Variation in time of the density of the SF6 gas (practically, in the presence of loss of gas, we could know in advance when the device will alarm). - CTs (SF6 insulated): • Variation of the density of the SF6 gas in time (as aforementioned for the switch). - Capacitive VTs: • Secondary voltages in order to identify on-line any failure of the VTs (by comparing the same secondary voltages by means of a dedicated algorithm). - Surge arresters: • Peak value of leakage current; • RMS of the third harmonic component; • Number of interventions. - Transformers: • Temperature (of the transformers and in and out of the coolers); • Load current (via the current transformers present in Terna's substation); • Gas dissolved in oil. A fundamental design criterion of the system consists in the collection of monitoring devices which must not lower the overall system reliability. As a consequence of this design criterion, manufacturing methods follow the guidelines of extreme reliability for the components used and no interference with the controlled system. Each monitored equipment will be provided with a monitoring unit. Each remote monitoring unit allows to get the most important information of the relative apparatus. The remote monitoring units are connected by fibre optic to the feeder of the central unit. Once it has received the information from the remote units, the feeder of the central unit sends the measurements and the alarms after their computation to the SCADA system. The information are sent to PSE/MBI using the IEC 60870-5-101 or 104 protocols. It is possible to use the same physical connections in order to send from remote commands and/or new configurations and to receive the status of the different monitoring units. Each remote monitoring unit, as well as the feeder of the central unit, have their firmware and setting parameters. It is possible to upgrade firmware and setting parameters without the need to physically intervene in the field. This on-line diagnostic system is very flexible as the remote monitoring units are not dependent from any manufacturer of the components and the feeder of the central unit can handle different protocols. In conclusion, the new diagnostic system allows the monitoring of a variety of substation equipments with reduced impact on the existing circuits in order to have a condition-based maintenance hence reducing the outage time and the related cost and increasing the apparatus lifespan.","CTs: current transformer; Mbi: Monitoring & business intelligence; MRE: electrical grid monitoring; PSE: Operation & Maintenance Support Platform; PST: Phase Shifting Transformer; VTs: capacitive voltage transformer","Auxiliary device; Capacitive voltage transformer; Condition based maintenance; Controlled system; Diagnostic systems; Different protocols; Electrical grids; Fundamental design; Interrupted current; Life span; Load currents; Logic signals; Maintenance activity; Manufacturing methods; Monitoring device; Monitoring parameters; On-line monitoring system; Online diagnostic systems; Outage time; Peak values; Phase shifting transformer; Remote monitoring; Remote units; Secondary voltage; Setting parameters; Substation equipment; Surge arresters; System reliability; Third harmonic components; Transmission system operators; Artificial intelligence; Auxiliary equipment; Decision support systems; Electric circuit breakers; Electric instrument transformers; Feeding; Firmware; Maintenance; Manufacture; Remote control; SCADA systems; Sulfur hexafluoride; Switches; Time switches; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872120381

There are screening guidelines well assessed and overall accepted in several world nations. The question is if they are actually applied in the healthcare practice. The difficulty in the analysis of the application of diagnostic pathways is in the necessity to do a sort of time travel in the past: to chose a group of patients that have the same diagnosis, say colon cancer, and to be able to trace the pathways that led to the diagnosis. By exploiting the ability of data mining techniques to extract sequences from large masses of raw data, it has been possible to reconstruct the actual diagnostic services accessed with larger frequency by the patients and even the sequence of accessed services. The results show that there is a large majority of patients that followed pathways differing from the standard guidelines. The study describes how the database was built, the techniques adopted to extract and group together the data and concludes with an analysis of the diagnostic pathways. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Data mining; Decision support systems; Diagnostic pathways; Patient flow; Sequence extraction","Colon cancer; Data mining techniques; Diagnostic pathways; Patient flow; Standard guidelines; Time travel; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Trace analysis; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872087265

Previous approaches to automatically generate IT change plans struggle, in terms of scalability, to properly deal with large Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs). To enable IT change planning in the large, in this paper we discuss and analyze optimizations for refinement-based IT change planning over object-oriented CMDBs. Our optimizations reduce the runtime complexity of several key operations part of refinement-based IT change planning algorithms. A sensitivity analysis shows that our optimizations outperform SHOP2 - the winner of a previous comparison among IT change planners - in terms of runtime complexity for several important characteristics of IT changes and CMDBs.

However, there has always been a debate about contents' trust worthiness. Nevertheless, social media is totally discouraged to be considered in healthcare due to fear of open and unauthenticated contents. With all these reservations, the importance of information shared through social networks can never be ignored. This paper investigates the role of social media in patient centric healthcare.

However, emails are not only, efficient, cheap, and rapid mean of communication, but also are becoming favourite lucrative business spammers. According to many survey reports, the amount of unsolicited e-mails, known as spam e-mails, is becoming a great and a serious problem because of the huge losses they yield to the organizations, ranging from extensive bandwidth consumption, mail server processing load, to user's productivity due to time spent on detection and dealing with spam mails. Initially, spam e-mails contained only textual messages and were easily detected by the text-based spam filters. To avoid detection, spammers have come up with a new approach to send their spam. It consists in including their advertisements as part of an embedded image file attachment (.gif,.jpg,.png, etc.) rather than the body of the e-mails hence defeating text-based spam filtering techniques. This paper investigates the major image spam filtering techniques in current use. While studying these techniques, both success rates and possible problems are explored. The relevant work shows that spammers are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to adapt to all challenges, hence defeating the conventional spam filtering techniques. Consequently, image spam detection techniques should be scalable and adaptable to meet the future spammers' tactics. © 2012 IEEE.","classification; detection techniques; filtering; image spam; spam","Bandwidth consumption; Detection technique; Embedded images; image spam; Lucrative business; Mail servers; spam; Spam detection; SPAM filter; Spam filtering technique; Spam mails; Spammers; Time spent; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Communication; Electronic mail; Filtration; Internet",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872019350

However, software reuse does not reach its full potential due to lack of the trace ability between software components and business goals. Trace ability is a key factor for reusability of software components. In this paper, we propose the pattern-oriented development approach that results in a component model. Architecture is used to describe component composition, and the links between components are defined formally. Patterns are used to describe the development expertise. The trace ability between different models at different abstract levels is created as the side effect of development process of the software components.

This paper aims at exploring the potential of formal modelling techniques already developed for studying dynamical systems. The benefits of these techniques are shown in the analysis of a generic ACO algorithm applied to problems modelled as binary chains. The theoretical model developed is able to give new insights on the overall system dynamics, predicting the system long-term behaviours and the influence of specific parameters on such behaviours.

As charging can be conducted during the stay time in each tourist spot, the waiting time is greatly dependent on the visiting order. After formulating the per-spot waiting time according to the initial battery amount and the earned distance credit, our scheme traverses the search space to find the visiting sequence having the minimum waiting time. The performance measurement results obtained from a prototype implementation reveal that the proposed scheme can add just 40 minutes when the total trip length is about 195 km, which may need about a few hour charging in slow chargers, for the given parameter set including average stay time and inter-spot distance. Moreover, our scheme outperforms the well-known traveling salesman problem solver by up to 14.7 % in terms of tour time. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","battery charging; electric vehicle; rent-a-car business; tour schedule; trip time efficiency","Parameter set; Performance measurements; Prototype implementations; Schedule generation; Search spaces; tour schedule; Traveling salesman; Trip time; Artificial intelligence; Electric vehicles; Traveling salesman problem; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870791955

Consequently efforts to improve tractability are very valuable and meta-heuristic algorithms are now commonly applied in artificial intelligence frameworks and expert systems. The speed of network evaluation is a binding constraint on performance of meta-heuristic techniques. This is particularly challenging for CDMA-based systems because power allocation is required before coverage can be evaluated. The current most efficient heuristic for achieving this requires O(n2 · nstp) time where ncell is the number of cells and nstp is the number of active user locations. In the large-scale scenarios that arise in practice, nstp is large compared to ncell and consequently tractability is significantly impeded by nstp. We introduce a new approach to improve tractability for the network planning problem. This concerns changing the resolution of the problem scenario by creating virtual entities which combine spatial traffic requirements, thus reducing the number of nstp that require evaluation. By solving a linear programming formulation of the planning problem exactly (for small instances) and using a heuristic (for large instances), we examine in detail the change in quality of solution that this method induces. The results show that only a marginal reduction in quality of network evaluation is observed, while computational tractability is improved. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","CDMA; Cell planning; Network evaluation; Power control; Radio network design; UMTS",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870506959

Recent improvements in 3D imaging technology, among them development of micro-CT and micro-MRI scanners, allow in-vivo 3D high-resolution scanning and reconstruction of large specimens or even whole bone models. Thus, the tendency today is to evaluate bone features using 3D assessment techniques rather than traditional 2D methods. For this purpose, high-quality meshing methods are required. However, the 3D meshes produced from current commercial systems usually are of low quality with respect to analysis and rapid prototyping. 3D model reconstruction of bone is difficult due to the complexity of bone microstructure. The small bone features lead to a great deal of neighborhood ambiguity near each vertex. The relatively new neural network method for mesh reconstruction has the potential to create or remesh 3D models accurately and quickly. A neural network (NN), which resembles an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, is a set of interconnected neurons, where each neuron is capable of making an autonomous arithmetic calculation. Moreover, each neuron is affected by its surrounding neurons through the structure of the network. This paper proposes an extension of the growing neural gas (GNN) neural network technique for remeshing a triangular manifold mesh that represents bone microstructure. This method has the advantage of reconstructing the surface of a genus-n freeform object without a priori knowledge regarding the original object, its topology, or its shape. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","3D model reconstruction; Meshing; Microstructure; Neural network; Self-organizing map neural network","algorithm; arithmetic; article; bone; calculation; gas; human; micro-computed tomography; nerve cell; nerve cell network; priority journal; three dimensional imaging; artificial neural network; audiovisual equipment; histology; methodology; three dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; Algorithms; Bone and Bones; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Anatomic; Neural Networks (Computer)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867293767

To solve this problem, agile software development is used to overcome the difficulty of analysis, and business rules approach is utilised for removing maintenance issues.

As the ""Big Data"" trend is sweeping through academia, enterprises and governments with large amounts of data from various new sources, it results in tremendous potential opportunities to extract values from it, such as automatically discovering novel patterns which would be impossible with small samples from a single data source. Meanwhile, complicated by the connectivity and interdependence of the world's markets, corporations and financial instruments, significant challenges have been posted for efficiently managing relevant datasets which would be used to facilitate scientific discoveries and support business decisions. This tutorial demonstrates an approach to address the data interchange challenges by illustrating how the Semantic Web technologies can be used in interacting with financial and economic data. We first introduce an incremental data organization model based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and then show the processes of data collecting, adding structures as well as domain knowledge and linking across different data sources. In keeping with CIFEr's practical spirit, this tutorial gives participants hand-on experience of using SPARQL to query large datasets in RDF, and analyzing the results with R through examples such as retrieving textual data from the New York Times and studying corporations' lobbying behaviors. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Big datum; Business decisions; Critical tasks; Data collecting; Data interchange; Data sets; Data-sources; Domain knowledge; Economic data; Heterogeneous sources; Incremental data; Industrial practitioners; Large amounts of data; Large datasets; New sources; New york time; Novel patterns; Resource description framework; Scientific discovery; Semantic Web technology; Small samples; Textual data; Artificial intelligence; Industry; Information management; Finance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869830736

The abundance of systemic risk measures and risk models has added to the complex task of understanding, discussing, and acting on the implications of that risk. Tools that assist decision makers to interpret risk measures, and recognize their underlying assumptions may lead to deeper understanding and more effective discussion. This paper describes some initial considerations for building an integrated modeling and analysis environment to aid in assessing complex financial data. The modeling environment is engineered to support execution of quantitative models including agent based and network models against equivalent scenarios of economic conditions. The environment provides tools to compare and visualize model outputs, and to allow decision makers to maintain traceability from model outputs back to their underlying assumptions. This capability may facilitate the operation of a modeling forum where disparate teams of analysts can collaborate to provide insights into the nation's exposure to systemic financial risk. © 2012 IEEE.","Communication effectiveness; Computational modeling; Computer simulation; Interconnected systems; Multilevel systems","Agent based; Communication effectiveness; Complex task; Computational modeling; Decision makers; Economic condition; Financial data; Financial risks; Financial system; Integrated modeling; Model outputs; Modeling environments; Multi-level systems; Network models; Policy makers; Quantitative models; Risk measures; Risk model; Risk modeling; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Large scale systems; Risk assessment; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869762882

The nature of data streams makes streaming techniques a promising way to handle large amounts of data, since their main ideas are to avoid multiple scans and optimize memory usage. In this paper we propose in detail an algorithm for finding frequent patterns in large databases following a star schema, based on streaming techniques. It is able to mine traditional star schemas, as well as stars with degenerate dimensions. It is able to aggregate the rows in the fact table that relate to the same business fact, and therefore find patterns at the right business level.

Hence after we propose a calculation mechanism of service value and added value for situations including data as a service (DaaS), information as a service (FaaS), composition scenarios, optimization and their mix with usage explanations. Ongoing complicated implementation which centers service contracts is outlined. © 2012 IEEE.","added value; knowledge; multiple semantics; service contract; service value","Added values; knowledge; Service contract; Service selection; Service systems; service value; Target object; Artificial intelligence; Contracts; Digital storage; Maintenance; Semantics; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868533599

As these services may offer different Quality of Services (QoS) values, taking into account user preferences on QoS attributes allow to retrieve the most appropriate services. In this paper, we advocate an approach for handling preferences on QoS parameters in a bipolar way, i.e., distinguishing between negative and positive preferences as it seems to be the case in the human mind. Negative preferences represent constraints that have to be satisfied by the returned services, while positive preferences express wishes and are not compulsory. Finally, a set of experiments based on real data is conducted to demonstrate the relevance and the scalability of our proposal. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","bipolarity; fuzzy set theory; preferences; Process model retrieval; quality of services","bipolarity; Business Process; High selectivity; Human mind; Number of services; preferences; Process model; QoS attributes; QoS parameters; Artificial intelligence; Data processing; Fuzzy set theory; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868034956

Five answers to this question are discussed in the paper. (1) The classicist answer: symbolic (digital) computation is required for explaining cognition; (2) The broad digital computationalist answer: digital computation broadly construed is required for explaining cognition; (3) The connectionist answer: subsymbolic computation is required for explaining cognition; (4) The computational neuroscientist answer: neural computation (that, strictly, is neither digital nor analogue) is required for explaining cognition; (5) The extreme dynamicist answer: computation is not required for explaining cognition. The first four answers are only accurate to a first approximation. But the ''devil'' is in the details. The last answer cashes in on the parenthetical ''if any'' in the question above. The classicist argues that cognition is symbolic computation. But digital computationalism need not be equated with classicism. Indeed, computationalism can, in principle, range from digital (and analogue) computationalism through (the weaker thesis of) generic computationalism to (the even weaker thesis of) digital (or analogue) pancomputationalism. Connectionism, which has traditionally been criticised by classicists for being non-computational, can be plausibly construed as being either analogue or digital computationalism (depending on the type of connectionist networks used). Computational neuroscience invokes the notion of neural computation that may (possibly) be interpreted as a sui generis type of computation. The extreme dynamicist argues that the time has come for a postcomputational cognitive science. This paper is an attempt to shed some light on this debate by examining various conceptions and misconceptions of (particularly digital) computation. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Classicism; Cognitive science; Computation; Computational neuroscience; Computationalism; Connectionism; Dynamicism; Mechanistic explanation; Representation","Classicism; Cognitive science; Computational neuroscience; Computationalism; Connectionism; Dynamicism; Mechanistic explanation; Representation; Artificial intelligence; Calculations; Philosophical aspects; Cognitive systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869864609

This study proposed an integrated model using ridge regression and a genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively select the major hydro-geological parameters influencing groundwater pollution vulnerability in an aquifer. The GA-Ridge regression method determined that depth to water, net recharge, topography, and the impact of vadose zone media were the hydro-geological parameters that influenced trichloroethene pollution vulnerability in a Korean aquifer. When using these selected hydro-geological parameters, the accuracy was improved for various statistical nonlinear and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and case-based reasoning.

We report two studies that, instead, explored the transferability of L1-orthographic processing skills in WM in logographic-L1 and alphabetic-L1 speakers. English-French bilingual and English monolinguals (both alphabetic-L1) speakers and Chinese-English (logographic-L1) speakers learned a set of artificial logographs and associated meanings (Study 1). The logographs were used in WM tasks with and without concurrent articulatory or visuo-spatial suppression. The logographic-L1 bilinguals were markedly less affected by articulatory suppression than alphabetic-L1 monolinguals (who did not differ from their bilingual peers). Bilinguals overall were less affected by spatial interference, reflecting superior phonological processing skills or, conceivably, greater executive control. A comparison of span sizes for meaningful and meaningless logographs (Study 2) replicated these findings.

Delegation involves assigning a given set of access rights from one user to another. In existing role delegation models, delegation is often authorized and controlled by a relation that specifies who can delegate to whom. The usage of such relations in delegation models has some disadvantages; such as complexity of maintenance, error proneness, inconsistencies and inabilities to define some organizational policies related to delegation. In this paper, we propose a new delegation model that depends on organizational lines of authority to authorize and control delegation. The main advantages of this approach are that it simplifies the management of delegation authorization and complies with organizational behavior. Furthermore, it eliminates inconsistencies related to changes to roles and permissions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Access Control; Delegation; RBAC; Revocation","Access rights; Delegation; Dynamic nature; Error proneness; Organizational behavior; Organizational policies; RBAC; Revocation; Role delegation; Artificial intelligence; Access control",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867008134

The aim of the paper is to discuss the application of artificial intelligence methods to managing the financial risks. During recent years, the use of intelligent systems in the financial and economic industries have increased substantially, providing a new perspective to the agenda of finance and economics by their ability to handle large amounts of financial data and simulate complex models. Generally, the commercial banking area can be considered as multi-agent systems with multiple interactions. Banking management includes the activities of decision support systems, query and reporting, online analytical processing, statistical analysis, forecasting, and data mining. Forecasting is essential for business. The advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over traditional statistical forecasting methods are that AI do not have to fulfill any statistical assumptions and the ability to handle non-linearity, which are common in business. The most common applications of computational finance are within the area of investment banking and financial risk management, and currently employ learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Bayesian approaches, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms, Ant colony and Particle Swarm Optimization. In this paper, we present a new concept for a formal description of the multi-agent systems with respect to the viewpoint of modeling, that is conditioned by the existence of nonlinear and fuzzy factor, respectively with entropy. The research was focused on the new approach of risk modeling and optimization based on structural transmutation of agent-based graph. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A combination of the cost-effective Cloud Computing approach with extended group decision support system technology bears several interesting unprecedented opportunities for the development of such solutions. These opportunities include ubiquitous accessibility to decision support software and, thus, the possibility to flexibly involve remote experts in group decision processes, guided access to background information, and facilitation support to direct group decision processes. The architects of such future solutions are challenged by numerous requirements that need to be considered and reflected in an integrated architectural approach. This article presents a thorough analysis of major design considerations for software solutions for collaborative decision making from a broad range of perspectives especially including the business process management perspective and the Cloud Computing perspective. The proposed architectural approach of the GRUPO-MOD system demonstrates how one can address the requirements in one integrated system architecture that supports different deployment options of Cloud Computing.

Two different coolant strategies are tested: traditional working fluid and MQL (Minimum Quantity Lubrication). The model is based on a machine learning classification method known as Bayesian networks.

However, the Taguchi method is unable to deal with multi-response problems that are of main interest today, owing to increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and products. Several recent studies have been conducted in order to solve this problem. But, they did not effectively treat situations where responses are correlated and situations in which control factors have continuous values. This study proposed an integrated model for experimental design of processes with multiple correlated responses, composed of three stages which (1) use expert system, designed for selecting an inner and an outer orthogonal array, to design an actual experiment, (2) use Taguchi's quality loss function to present relative significance of responses, and multivariate statistical methods to uncorrelate and synthesise responses into a single performance measure, (3) use neural networks to construct the response function model and genetic algorithms to optimise parameter design. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated with three examples. Results of analysis showed that the proposed approach could yield a better solution in terms of the optimal parameters setting that results in a higher process performance measure than the traditional experimental design. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Back-propagation neural network; Experimental design; Expert system; Genetic algorithm; Multi-response process; Taguchi method","Actual experiments; Back propagation neural networks; Continuous value; Control factors; Integrated approach; Integrated models; Manufacturing process; Multi-response problem; Multiresponse; Multivariate statistical method; Optimal parameter; Orthogonal array; Parameter designs; Performance measure; Process parameters; Process performance; Response functions; Robust parameter design; Taguchi; Taguchi's quality loss functions; Design of experiments; Expert systems; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Orthogonal functions; Statistics; Taguchi methods; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870876464

The problem is classic but still attracts much attention because of its hardness and its prominent applications. Our work is based on the existence of an order of all the vertices whereby those belonging to a maximum clique stay close enough to each other. Such an order can be identified via the extraction of a particular subgraph from the original graph. The problem can consequently be seen as a permutation problem that can be addressed efficiently by metaheuristics. We first design a memetic algorithm (MA) for this purpose. Computational experiments conducted on the DIMACS benchmark instances clearly show that our MA not only outperforms existing genetic approaches, but it also compares very well to stateof- the-art algorithms regarding the maximal clique size found after different runs. Furthermore, we show that a hybridization of MA with an iterated local search (ILS) improves the stability of the algorithm. This hybridization (MA-ILS) permits to find two distinct maximal cliques of size 79 and one of size 80 for the C2000.9 instance of the DIMACS benchmark. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Circular-arc graph; Genetic algorithm; Iterated local search; Maximum clique problem; Metaheuristics; Triangulated graph","Circular-arc graph; Iterated local search; Maximum clique problems; Meta heuristics; Triangulated graph; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Software engineering; Heuristic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869494979

The minority class is usually of primary interest. However, most rule-based classifiers are biased towards the majority classes and they have difficulties with correct recognition of the minority class. In this paper we discuss sources of these difficulties related to data characteristics or to an algorithm itself. Among the problems related to the data distribution we focus on the role of small disjuncts, overlapping of classes and presence of noisy examples. Then, we show that standard techniques for induction of rule-based classifiers, such as sequential covering, top-down induction of rules or classification strategies, were created with the assumption of balanced data distribution, and we explain why they are biased towards the majority classes. Some modifications of rule-based classifiers have been already introduced, but they usually concentrate on individual problems. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm, BRACID, which more comprehensively addresses the issues associated with imbalanced data. Its main characteristics includes a hybrid representation of rules and single examples, bottom-up learning of rules and a local classification strategy using nearest rules. The usefulness of BRACID has been evaluated in experiments on several imbalanced datasets. The results show that BRACID significantly outperforms the well known rule-based classifiers C4.5rules, RIPPER, PART, CN2, MODLEM as well as other related classifiers as RISE or K-NN. Moreover, it is comparable or better than the studied approaches specialized for imbalanced data such as generalizations of rule algorithms or combinations of SMOTE + ENN preprocessing with PART. Finally, it improves the support of minority class rules, leading to better recognition of the minority class examples. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Classifiers; Imbalanced data; Nearest neighbour paradigm; Nearest rules; Rule induction","Data characteristics; Data distribution; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced Data-sets; Learning rules; Nearest neighbour; Nearest rules; Novel algorithm; Rule induction; Rule-based classifier; Small disjuncts; Topdown; Under-represented; Artificial intelligence; Classifiers; Information systems; Algorithms",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868623433

It aims to distill the most important information from a set of documents to generate a compressed summary. Given a set of documents as input, most of existing multi-document summarization approaches utilize different sentence selection techniques to extract a set of sentences from the document set as the summary. The submodularity hidden in the term coverage and the textual-unit similarity motivates us to incorporate this property into our solution to multidocument summarization tasks. In this paper, we propose a new principled and versatile framework for different multidocument summarization tasks using submodular functions (Nemhauser et al. in Math. Prog. 14(1):265-294, 1978) based on the term coverage and the textual-unit similarity which can be efficiently optimized through the improved greedy algorithm. We show that four known summarization tasks, including generic, query-focused, update, and comparative summarization, can be modeled as different variations derived from the proposed framework. Experiments on benchmark summarization data sets (e.g., DUC04-06, TAC08, TDT2 corpora) are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed framework for the general multi-document summarization tasks. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Greedy algorithm; Multi-document summarization; Submodularity","Data sets; Greedy algorithms; Multi-document summarization; Sentence selection; Submodular functions; Submodularity; Artificial intelligence; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868362932

In this paper, an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization (IAPSO) is presented.

It is shown that the proposed JOPRA algorithm can converge fast to the optimum and reach larger total data rate and utility while less total power is consumed by comparison with the original APSO. This thanks to the dynamic change of the maximum movement velocity of the particles, the use of the modified replacement procedure in constraint handling, and the consideration of the state of the optimization run and the population diversity in stopping criteria.

In this paper, we propose a new multipath routing algorithm for QoS-sensitive multimedia services.

According to the load balancing strategy, data packets are adaptively distributed through the established paths while maintaining an acceptable level of QoS requirement.

Compared with the hospital or physician-centered healthcare process, the customer-centered healthcare process requires more knowledge and modeling such a process is extremely complex. Thus, building a care process model for a special customer is cost prohibitive. In addition, during the execution of a care process model, the information system should have flexibility to modify the model so that it adapts to changes in the healthcare process. Therefore, supporting the process in a flexible, cost-effective way is a key challenge for information technology. To meet this challenge, first, we analyze various kinds of knowledge used in process modeling, illustrate their characteristics, and detail their roles and effects in careflow modeling. Secondly, we propose a methodology to manage a lifecycle of the healthcare process modeling, with which models could be built gradually with convenience and efficiency. In this lifecycle, different levels of process models are established based on the kinds of knowledge involved, and the diffusion strategy of these process models is designed.

The current iPHR is passive and follows the pull model of information distribution. This paper introduces triggers and monitoring into iPHR to make iPHR become active. Our idea is to let medical professionals pre-compile triggers and store them in iPHR's knowledge base. Each trigger corresponds to an abnormal event that may have potential medical impact. iPHR keeps collecting, processing, and analyzing the user's medical data from various sources such as wearable sensors. Whenever an abnormal event is detected from the user's medical data, the corresponding trigger fires and the related personalized healthcare information is pushed to the user using natural language generation technology, expert system technology, and Web search technology. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Expert system; Monitoring; Natural language generation; Personal health record; Search engine; Trigger","article; artifact; asthma; chronic obstructive lung disease; data analysis; electronic medical record; expert system; home care; human; information processing; knowledge base; medical information system; online system; personal health record; weight reduction; artificial intelligence; information system; Internet; methodology; organization and management; personalized medicine; reminder system; Artificial Intelligence; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Information Management; Information Systems; Internet; Reminder Systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867302715

The CAD system is comprised of three stages. Focusing on dimension reduction, the first stage applies PCA to construct the most discriminative new feature set. After then, the system switches to the second stage whose target is model construction. ELM classifier is explored to train an optimal predictive model whose parameters are optimized. As we known, the number of hidden neurons has an important role in the performance of ELM, so we propose an experimental method to hunt for the optimal value. Finally, the obtained optimal ELM model proceeds to perform the thyroid disease diagnosis tasks using the most discriminative new feature set and the optimal parameters. The effectiveness of the resultant CAD system (PCA-ELM) has been rigorously estimated on a thyroid disease dataset which is taken from UCI machine learning repository. We compare it with other related methods in terms of their classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PCA-ELM outperforms other ones reported so far by 10-fold cross-validation method, with the mean accuracy of 97.73% and with the maximum accuracy of 98.1%. Besides, PCA-ELM performs much faster than support vector machines (SVM) based CAD system.

Using the theoretical tools created by the project, in this paper we describe the complete life cycle of instantiating an electronic contracting system using the contract framework within the aerospace aftercare domain. Thus, we use a natural language description of parts of the types of contracts used in this domain to generate individual norms amenable to a computational representation, and how these norms are used to generate a concrete contract monitor.

However, in the Business Rules community the business models are usually represented using object models (OM). Many of the existing Business Rules Management Systems (BRMS) allow the Business Users to represent Business Object Models in their own proprietary languages. Some work has been done in the last years to bridge the gap between the ontologies and the Business Rules. A pragmatic approach consist in projecting ontologies into the Object Models used by the BRMS, to ease the use of ontologies by the Business Users. The main issue with this approach is that the expressive power of the targeted Object Model is not enough to cope with the content of the ontology. Hence, the translation looses some of the information contained in the ontology, such as axioms. The aim of this paper, is to go a step further using this approach by translating some of the axioms defined in an OWL ontology into Business Rules. This translation brings at least two benefits: (i) it allow the Business Users to understand better the content of the Ontology by having some of its axioms in the rule language they are used to. (ii) at the run-time level, the translated axioms will be handled by the rule engine. We explain the basic mechanism of this translation and detail its implementation in the JRules BRMS system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Business Rules; Ontologies; OWL; RIF-PRD","Basic mechanism; Business knowledge; Business models; Business objects; Business rules; Business-users; Expressive power; Management systems; Object model; OWL; OWL ontologies; RIF-PRD; Rule engine; Runtimes; Targeted objects; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Ontology; World Wide Web; Translation (languages)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866711579

Yet, the concept of a production system does not include the definition of a given control strategy. The control between rules in a production rule program is, in practice, defined by each implementation of a production rule engine. Engines have traditionally been implemented using the Rete algorithm. Since the turn of the century, however, production systems have evolved into industrial products known as Business Rules Management Systems (BRMS). BRMS have introduced new compilation and execution schemes, which are often called sequential in contrast with the incremental behavior of Rete. This change in execution scheme came with a change in semantics for rule programs. In this paper, we propose a formal description of the execution of production rule programs. Existing descriptions either ignore the control strategy, or assume a Rete semantics. Ours isolates the handling of rule eligibility in the control strategy, which allows us to describe the sequential execution semantics of rule programs, as well as the Rete semantics, and others. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Business rules; Control flows; Control strategies; Formal Description; Industrial product; Management systems; Production rules; Production system; Rete algorithm; Sequential execution; Artificial intelligence; Java programming language; Production engineering; Semantics; World Wide Web",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866668499

The proposed approach assumes that regulations written in natural language (NL) are an important source of knowledge but that turning them into formal statements is a complex task that cannot be fully automated. The present paper focuses on the first phase of this acquisition process, the normalization phase that aims at transforming NL statements into controlled language (CL), rather than on their formalization into an operational rule base. We show that turning a NL text into a set of self-sufficient and independent CL rules is itself a complex task that involves some lexical and syntactic normalizations but also the restoration of contextual information and of implicit semantic entities to get a set of self-sufficient and unambiguous rule statements. We also present the SemEx tool that supports the proposed acquisition methodology based on the selection of the relevant text fragments and their progressive and interactive transformation into CL rule statements. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Acquisition process; Business rules; Complex task; Contextual information; Implicit semantics; Natural languages; Rule acquisition; Rule base; Text fragments; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Semantics; World Wide Web; Mergers and acquisitions",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866653343

An important motivation of consuming SDTs is to easily validate a decision table during the Validation and Verification (V&V) processes. An SDT contains a set of formal agreements called commitments. They are grounded on a domain ontology and considered as a result from group decision making processes, which involve a community of business stakeholders. A commitment contains a set of constraints, such as uniqueness and mandatory, with which we can analyze a decision table. A vital analysis issue is to detect inconsistency, which can arise within one table or across tables. In this paper, we focus on the formalization of the semantics within one SDT using the Description Logic (D). By doing so, we can use existing reasoners to detect inconsistency and thus assist decision modelers (and evaluators) to validate a decision table. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Conceptual Modeling; Description Logics; Semantic Decision Table","Conceptual modeling; Description logic; Domain ontologies; Group Decision Making; Modeling process; Semantic decision table; Validation and verification; Artificial intelligence; Computer programming languages; Data description; Formal languages; Semantics; World Wide Web; Decision tables",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866645947

A number of classification methods are available for estimating the changing status of air quality. However, a discrepancy frequently arises from the quality criteria of air employed and vagueness or fuzziness embedded in the decision making output values. Owing to inherent imprecision, difficulties always exist in some conventional methodologies like air quality index when describing integrated air quality conditions with respect to various pollutants parameters and time of exposure. In recent years, the fuzzy logicbased methods have demonstrated to be appropriated to address uncertainty and subjectivity in environmental issues. In the present study, a methodology based on fuzzy inference systems (FIS) to assess air quality is proposed. This paper presents a comparative study to assess status of air quality using fuzzy logic technique and that of conventional technique. The findings clearly indicate that the FIS may successfully harmonize inherent discrepancies and interpret complex conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Air quality index; Fuzzy model; Pollutant parameters","Classification methods; Comparative studies; Complex condition; Conventional techniques; Environmental issues; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy logic techniques; Fuzzy models; Output values; Pollutant parameters; Quality criteria; Quality indices; Environmental management; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Pollution; Quality assurance; Soft computing; Air quality; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; artificial intelligence; atmospheric pollution; fuzzy mathematics; numerical model; air pollutant; air quality; Air Quality Index; article; controlled study; decision support system; environmental monitoring; fuzzy system; India; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; suspended particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866539270

In fact, in this paper we propose that neuroscience shows that sociocognitivity is for real. In other words, cognition, in the broad sense, is not exclusive to living organisms: Certain kinds of social organizations (e. g. the enterprise) possess elementary cognitive capabilities by virtue of their structure and their functions. The classical theory of organizational cognition is the theory of Artificial Intelligence. We submit that this approach has proven to be false and barren, and that a materialist emergentist neuroscientific approach, in the tradition of Mario Bunge (2003, 2006), leads to a far more fruitful viewpoint, both for theory development and for eventual factual verification. Our proposals for sociocognitivity are based on findings in three areas of modern neuroscience and biopsychology: (1) The theory of intelligence and of intelligent systems; (2) The neurological theory of memory as distributed, hierarchical neuronal systems; (3) The theory of cognitive action in general and of learning in particular. We submit that findings in every one of these areas are applicable to the social organization. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866456192

Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Decision support systems-user experience; Decision-making; Human-computer interaction; Preference elicitation; Privacy; Recommender systems; User testing; User-centric evaluation","Controlled experiment; Decision supports; Field trial; Prediction algorithms; Preference elicitation; Privacy concerns; Structural equation modeling; Subjective aspects; System aspects; System effectiveness; Three component; User behaviors; User experience; User testing; User-centric; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Commerce; Data privacy; Decision support systems; Human computer interaction; Recommender systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866024894

Such technologies focused essentially on the structured data. In particular Data Warehousing systems represent the decision support systems on which academia and industry focused their attention. It is believed that ""about 80% of the information of any organization is contained in unstructured and semi-structured documents""[1], so limiting the analysis to only the structured data, as it has been done so far, is likely to lose a high percentage of potentially useful knowledge. Since text is the primary mean to disseminate information and knowledge, it is necessary to introduce concepts related to text-oriented Business Intelligent and Document Warehousing systems, which could have many useful applications in industries or large domains.

Scalability and effectiveness of collective intelligence are becoming increasingly attractive to investors. However, to fully exploit this potential we still have to develop crowd-management frameworks capable of supporting rich collaboration models, smart task division and virtual careers. An important step in this direction is the development of models of rewarding/incentivizing processes.

Process specialization is an effective reuse method that can be used to customize and extend base process models to specialized models. In the recent years, artifact-centric business process modeling has emerged as it supports a more flexible process structure compared with traditional activity-centric process models. Although, process specialization has been studied for the traditional models by treating a process as a single object, the specialization of artifact-centric processes that consist of multiple interacting artifacts has not been studied. Inheriting interactions among artifacts for specialized processes and ensuring the consistency of the processes are challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for process specialization comprising artifact-centric process models, methods to define a specialized process model based on an existing process model, and the behavior consistency between the specialized model and its base model. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Artifact-centric; Base models; Behavior consistency; Business Process; Business process modeling; Dynamic business; Flexible process; Process model; Single object; Artificial intelligence; Enterprise resource management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866377181

Organizations, private and public, are under pressures that force them to respond quickly to changing conditions and to be innovative in the way they operate. Such activities require organizations to be agile and to make frequent and quick strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. In today's era, we observe major changes in how managers use computerized support in making decisions. As more number of decision-makers become computer literate, decision support systems (DSS) is evolving from its beginning as a personal support tool and is becoming the shared resource in an organization. Data mining has been an active area of research in last two decades. Integration of data mining and decision support systems (DSS) can lead to the improved performance and can enable the tackling of new types of problems. In the recent past, there has been an increasing interest in applying evolutionary methods to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and a number of successful applications of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) to KDD have been demonstrated. No single algorithm has been found to be superior over all others for all data sets. This paper sheds some light on the selection of evolutionary approach based hybrid classification models in diversity of datasets from different domains. NNEP-C (s), XCS-C (s) GFS-GP-C(s) evolved from the combination of genetic algorithm and other techniques as neural network, self evolving GA and fuzzy learning have been tested on five datasets based on selected quality measures like predictive accuracy and training time. XCS-C(s) shows faster speed as compared to its competitor NNEP-C(s). GFS-GP-C(s) is the slowest one. © 2012 ACM.","decision support systems; genetic programming; hybrid models; knowledge discovery in databases; predictive accuracy; training time","Active area; Data mining algorithm; Data sets; Decision makers; Different domains; Evolutionary approach; Evolutionary method; Fuzzy learning; Hybrid classification; Hybrid model; Knowledge discovery in database; Making decision; Operational decisions; Predictive accuracy; Quality measures; Shared resources; Support tool; Training time; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data mining; Decision support systems; Genetic programming; Information science; Genetic algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866124309

At present in fact, most plant data is just displayed instantaneously at some user interface and then lost forever. Additionally the Level 2 databases typically store their process data for just a few months. In other words, there is a considerable waste of opportunities to gather information as data is not considered from a historical perspective. In any case, the tools available with which to analyze the data available are not as user friendly and flexible as they need to be. The MOREIntelligence system has been conceived and developed in order to address this major concern: the transformation of the huge amount of production data available into information for decision-making, i.e. knowledge. The system collects data from a range of heterogeneous sources, automatically reconciles, synchronizes and normalizes them, storing the results in a dedicated database. For the melting process, in particular, MOREIntelligence collects and stores the enormous quantity of data generated during the production and, most importantly, readily facilitates finding correlations and dependencies among the great number of different variables involved here. MOREIntelligence provides an overview of the KPIs and BPIs via standardised web reports, while providing powerful features for further unrestricted ad-hoc exploration of the data.","Analytics; Business Intelligence; Data Mining; Decision Support System; Multi-dimensional Analysis; OLAP; Statistical Analysis","Acquisition systems; Analytics; Heterogeneous sources; Historical perspective; Information concerning; Level 2; Melting process; Metallurgical process; Multi-dimensional Analysis; Multi-dimensional data analysis; OLAP; Plant data; Process data; Production data; User friendly; Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Exhibitions; Metallurgy; SCADA systems; Statistical methods; Steelmaking; User interfaces; Metadata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866105449

E-mail and the municipal web site are the two preferred modes of communication, with social media ranking third. For dialogue and participation, a face to face meeting is the preferred mode of communication.

In multi-issue negotiations a concession refers to the amount of utility a party decides to give up by making next offer. In multi-attribute auctions concession is reflected in the next bid by a bidding party that abides by the rules of a given auction mechanism. The purpose of this work is to share insights into concession-making behavior in multi-bilateral multi-issue negotiations vs. multi-attribute reverse auctions. To this end experiments have been conducted featuring auction and negotiation mechanisms. One finding indicates that participants in auctions tend to make larger concessions than those involved in negotiations. Another finding shows that the negotiators' effort to make a concession may not be perceived by their counterparts © 2012 ACM.","auctions; concession making; decision support systems; e-negotiations; e-procurement; experimental study; multiattribute auctions; multibilateral negotiations; negotiations; online auctions","auctions; concession making; E-negotiations; e-Procurement; Experimental studies; Multi-attribute auction; multibilateral negotiations; negotiations; Online auctions; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Electronic commerce",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866020559

Those models or patterns can be used to support the decision making process in organizations. In the health domain, and besides the support to the decision process, those algorithms are useful in the analysis and characterization of several diseases. This paper presents the particular case of the use of different Data Mining algorithms to support health care specialists in the analysis and characterization of symptoms and risk factors related with the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. This is an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and that affects up to one quarter of the adults with 40 or more years. For this specific study, data from 1.880 individuals were analysed with decision trees and artificial neural networks in order to identify predictive models for this disease. Clustering was used to identify groups of individuals, with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presenting similar risk factors and symptoms. Furthermore, association rules were used to identify correlations among the risk factors and the symptoms. The results obtained so far are promising as several models confirm the difficulties that are normally associated to the diagnosis of this disease and point to characteristics that must be taken into account in its comprehension. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","business intelligence; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; data mining; decision models","Analysis and characterization; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Data mining algorithm; Decision making process; Decision models; Decision process; Predictive models; Risk factors; Algorithms; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Health care; Information science; Information technology; Neural networks; Pulmonary diseases; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865609993

Several service-oriented methodologies have been proposed in both academia and industry. Few methodologies, however, do provide concrete yet pragmatic support for developing software that is truly service-oriented, supporting service-specific aspects and challenges. As a consequence, the design of software services that are in-line with service aspects is left up to the prudence of the developers. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a methodology that incorporates essential ingredients of SOA during analysis and design. The methodology focuses service inventories while consciously addressing the perspectives of both service providers and service consumers. By supporting service-oriented reasoning, our methodology results in better reusable services, and the available inventories aid the development of service-oriented systems in a more cost-effective way.

In order to leverage BPMN for the dynamic distribution of business processes, this paper presents an analysis on the migratability of running BPMN process instances.

This game, which was chosen for the Google Artificial Intelligence Challenge in 2010, requires the bot to deal with multiple target planets, while achieving a certain degree of adaptability in order to defeat different opponents in different scenarios. The decision engine of the bot is initially based on a set of rules that have been defined after an empirical study, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for tuning the set of constants, weights and probabilities that those rules include, and therefore, the general behaviour of the bot. Then, the bot is supplied with the evolved decision engine and the results obtained when competing with other bots (a bot offered by Google as a sparring partner, and a scripted bot with a pre-established behaviour) are thoroughly analysed. The evaluation of the candidate solutions is based on the result of non-deterministic battles (and environmental interactions) against other bots, whose outcome depends on random draws as well as on the opponents' actions. Therefore, the proposed GA is dealing with a noisy fitness function. After analysing the effects of the noisy fitness, we conclude that tackling randomness via repeated combats and reevaluations reduces this effect and makes the GA a highly valuable approach for solving this problem. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.","Genetic algorithm; Noisy fitness; Parameter adaptation; Player behaviour optimisation; Real-time strategy game","Candidate solution; Decision engines; Empirical studies; Environmental interactions; Fitness functions; Multiple targets; Noisy fitness; Optimisations; Parameter adaptation; Real-time strategy games; Set of rules; Sparring Partners; Artificial intelligence; Genetic algorithms; Health; Optimization; Real time systems; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870951132

The proposed heuristic is composed of two phases. In the first phase the ACO technique is adopted to establish an archive consisting of a set of non-overlapping blocks and of a set of remaining cities (nodes) to be visited. The second phase is a block recombination phase where the set of blocks and the rest of cities are combined to form an artificial chromosome. The generated artificial chromosomes (ACs) will then be injected into a standard genetic algorithm (SGA) to speed up the convergence. The proposed method is called ""Puzzle-Based Genetic Algorithm"" or ""p-ACGA"". We demonstrate that p-ACGA performs very well on all TSPLIB problems, which have been solved to optimality by other researchers.

Accordingly, in this paper, we will draw on some key philosophical accounts of the nature of desire, including what distinguishes it from other mental and motivational states, in order to identify some key characteristics of desire as a complex concept.

It is argued that the degree of complexity, variation, and specialisation of technological artefacts used nowadays, along with their sheer number, represent an issue that can and should be addressed through an important step towards greater autonomy, that is, the integration of learning, which will allow the artefact to observe its own functionality and build a model of itself. This model can be used to adjust the expectations from an imperfectly manufactured item, patch up its performance and control its consistency over time, so providing a form of self-certification and a warning mechanism in case of deterioration. It is suggested that these goals cannot be fully achieved without the ability of the learner to model its own performance, and the implications and issues of this self-reflective learning are debated.

This paper proposes a new formulation of these multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO) algorithms. This formulation is based on adding specific algorithm components for tackling multiple objectives to the basic ACO metaheuristic. Examples of these components are how to represent multiple objectives using pheromone and heuristic information, how to select the best solutions for updating the pheromone information, and how to define and use weights to aggregate the different objectives. This formulation reveals more similarities than previously thought in the design choices made in existing MOACO algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is an experimental analysis of how particular design choices affect the quality and the shape of the Pareto front approximations generated by each MOACO algorithm. This study provides general guidelines to understand how MOACO algorithms work, and how to improve their design. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Ant colony optimization; Experimental analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-objective traveling salesman problem","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Experimental analysis; Heuristic information; Metaheuristic; Multi objective; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Multiobjective combinatorial optimization; Multiple objectives; Pareto front; Approximation algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Constrained optimization; Design; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Traveling salesman problem; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866482099

This shift from cognitive science to consciousness science presents a profound challenge to synthetic approaches. To be sure, symbolic artificial intelligence constituted the original foundation of cognitive science; subsequent progress in robotics has helped to pioneer a new understanding of the mind as essentially embodied, situated, and dynamical, while artificial life has informed the concept of biological self-organization. However, with regard to the development of a science of the experienced mind, the relevance of these synthetic approaches still remains uncertain. We propose to address the challenge of first-person experience by designing new human-computer interfaces, which aim to artificially mediate a participant's sensorimotor loop such that novel kinds of experience can emerge for the user. The advantage of this synthetic approach is that computer interface technology enables us to systematically vary the ways in which participants experience the world and thereby allows us to systematically investigate 'mind-as-it-could-be' from the first-person perspective. We illustrate the basic principles of this method by drawing on examples from our research in sensory substitution, virtual reality, and interactive installation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Artificial life; Consciousness; Embodiment; Enaction; Human-computer interface; Situatedness; Technology","Artificial Life; Consciousness; Embodiment; Enaction; Human computer interfaces; Situatedness; Artificial intelligence; Technology; Virtual reality; User interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866479346

The DSS aims to compare spatially and temporally sectorial water demands of the Haouz-Mejjate plain (Morocco) in regard to available surface and groundwater resources. It is composed of a tool for satellite estimation of Agricultural Water Demand (SAMIR), a tool for integrated water resources planning (WEAP) and a groundwater model (MODFLOW) each of them relying on a common Geographical Information System not described here. The DSS is operating on a monthly time scale. Agricultural water demand accounts for about 80% of the total demand. In areas where groundwater abstraction is difficult to quantify by direct methods, multitemporal remote sensing associated to the FAO methodology is a simple and efficient alternative to estimate Evapotranspiration (ET). In this work, a monthly estimate of ET from irrigated areas is derived from freely available MODIS NDVI for the 2001-2009 period. An important part of the paper deals with the validation of these estimates with eddy covariance flux measurements installed on different irrigated crops of the region. Results are satisfactory with a minus 6.5% error per year on the monthly time scale. This preprocessing allows to dichotomize irrigated versus non-irrigated areas, and then, to estimate groundwater abstraction in subareas distinguishing by their operating modes: traditional, dam or privately irrigated.

This method is widely used by the standards related to the executing of business processes in SOA environments. Many of the specifications relative to the types of process coordination, execution languages and notations which are used to design business processes are based on this approach. Unfortunately, there is no specification which provides mechanisms that guarantee the possibility of compensation. The lack of such mechanisms may lead to the situations which in the BPMN standard are defined as ""hazardous"". They occur when an execution of a process can neither be completed nor fully compensated. The result of this process is undetermined, inconsistent with intentions of a designer of a process and can lead to the loss of consistency. These cases often enforce manual engagement in resolving the situation and are a serious problem if we deal with numerous instances of processes.

By 2003, the neuroscience community had a good understanding of the characterization of sound which is carried out in the cochlea and auditory brainstem, and 1.4 GHz single-core computers with XGA displays were fast enough that it was possible to build computer models capable of running and visualizing these processes in isolation at near biological resolution in real-time, and it was possible to raise venture capital funding to begin the project. By 2008, these advances had permitted the development of products in the area of two-microphone noise reduction for mobile phones, leading to viable business by 2010, thus establishing a self-sustaining funding source to continue the work into the next decade 2010-2020. By 2011, advances in fMRI, multi-electrode, and behavioral studies have illuminated the cortical brain regions responsible for separating sounds in mixtures, understanding speech in quiet and in noisy environments, producing speech, recognizing speakers, and understanding and responding emotionally to music. 2GHz computers with 8 virtual cores and HD displays now permit models of these advanced auditory brain processes to be simulated and displayed simultaneously in real-time, giving a rich perspective on the concurrent and interacting representations of sound and meaning which are developed and maintained in the brain, and exposing a deeper generality to brain architecture than was evident a decade earlier. While there is much still to be discovered and implemented in the next decade, we can show demonstrable progress on the scientifically ambitious and commercially important goal of reverse-engineering the human auditory pathway. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Behavioral studies; Brain architecture; Brain process; Brain regions; Brainstem; Computer models; Computing platform; Funding sources; Human brain; Multi-electrode; Noisy environment; Two-microphone noise reduction; Venture capital funding; Artificial intelligence; Brain; Brain models; Computer simulation; Investments; Noise abatement; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865001553

However, it has been facing great difficulty in quickly discovering and dynamically combing available Web services to satisfy given request on-demand. Most of the current researches concentrated on the semantic model for service discovery, composition, and so on. But there are few studies concerned the intrinsic pattern and law of the service interactions and relationships. To achieve the vision of SOC in heterogeneous and open environment, in our opinion, not only the semantics of individual Web service but also the interactions and relationships among Web services are needed to be considered seriously. In this paper, beginning with combining Semantic Web and social networking technology within SOC paradigm, we study associations between Web services, mine the relationships among services to design and build Service Network (SN), analyze the structural and social characteristics and complexity of SN to reveal the user interests, business requests, information and data flow and direction. In short, we would like to reassess and reconsider the SOC paradigm from the network perspective, through finding new knowledge to build new theoretical basis and approach which can be used to guide and promote the service discovery, composition, and so on, in SOC paradigm.

Also, as analytics becomes a central part of many business functions such as customer segmentation, competitive intelligence and fraud detection, many businesses are seeking to enrich their internal data records with data from these data sources. As the number of sources with varying degrees of accuracy and quality proliferate, it is a non-trivial task to effectively select which sources to use for a particular enrichment task. The old model of statically buying data from one or two providers becomes inefficient because of the rapid growth of new forms of useful data such as social media and the lack of dynamism to plug sources in and out. In this paper, we present the data enrichment framework, a tool that uses data mining and other semantic techniques to automatically guide the selection of sources. The enrichment framework also monitors the quality of the data sources and automatically penalizes sources that continue to return low quality results.

KM has yet to be defined as a discipline of science. To some researchers, it is denoted as a multidisciplinary problems characterized by a number of core theoretical ideas, which include data and information management techniques, artificial intelligence, organizational theory and behaviour, sociology of knowledge and knowledge representation, and business economics and strategy. Nevertheless, within a short span of time, KM is believed to be a tool for designing an organization's goals, structures, and processes as to learn and to create value for its customers and community. It is also argued as a planned, structured approach to manage the creation, sharing, harvesting and leveraging of knowledge as an organizational asset, to enhance an organization's ability, speed and effectiveness. Different aspects of KM have been discussed by academicians. However, most academicians unanimously pointed out KM as a new innovation in knowledge. Therefore, to understand the KM concept, this paper will laid out KM brief development, its importance and process in enhancing work performance and improvement of organizational standards. © 2012 IEEE.","KM; knowledge management; organization; work place","Brief development; Business economics; KM; Multidisciplinary problems; Organizational standards; Organizational theory; Structured approach; Work performance; Work place; Artificial intelligence; Knowledge representation; Societies and institutions; Knowledge management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864819398

In this paper, a swarm intelligence technique based support vector machine classifier (PSO-SVM) is proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. In the proposed PSO-SVM, the issue of model selection and feature selection in SVM is simultaneously solved under particle swarm (PSO optimization) framework. A weighted function is adopted to design the objective function of PSO, which takes into account the average accuracy rates of SVM (ACC), the number of support vectors (SVs) and the selected features simultaneously. Furthermore, time varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) and inertia weight (TVIW) are employed to efficiently control the local and global search in PSO algorithm. The effectiveness of PSO-SVM has been rigorously evaluated against the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed system is compared with the grid search method with feature selection by F-score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only obtains much more appropriate model parameters and discriminative feature subset, but also needs smaller set of SVs for training, giving high predictive accuracy. In addition, Compared to the existing methods in previous studies, the proposed system can also be regarded as a promising success with the excellent classification accuracy of 99.3% via 10-fold cross validation (CV) analysis. Moreover, a combination of five informative features is identified, which might provide important insights to the nature of the breast cancer disease and give an important clue for the physicians to take a closer attention. We believe the promising result can ensure that the physicians make very accurate diagnostic decision in clinical breast cancer diagnosis. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breast cancer diagnosis; Feature selection; Particle swarm optimization; Support vector machines; Swarm intelligence","acceleration; algorithm; article; breast cancer; cancer classification; cancer diagnosis; clinical decision making; clinical effectiveness; decision support system; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; medical information system; predictive value; process optimization; support vector machine; weight; artificial intelligence; breast tumor; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; female; human; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Support Vector Machines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866075139

Computation, properly understood, can afford descriptions/explanations of any physical process, and since Swiatczak accepts that consciousness has a physical basis, his argument against computationalism must fail. Of course, we may not have much idea how consciousness (itself a rather unclear plurality of notions) might be implemented, but we do have a hypothesis-that all of our mental life, including consciousness, is the result of computational processes and so not tied to a biochemical substrate.

In the ensuing dispute between Searle and his own critics, I argue that Searle's 'internalist' strategy is unable to deflect Dennett's combined robotic-systems reply and the allied Total Turing Test (3T). Many would hold that the 3T marks the culmination of the dialectic and, in principle, constitutes a fully adequate empirical standard for judging that an artifact is intelligent on a par with human beings. However, the paper carries the debate forward by arguing that the sociolinguistic factors highlighted in externalist views in the philosophy of language indicate the need for a fundamental shift in perspective in a Truly Total Turing Test (4T). It's not enough to focus on Dennett's individual robot viewed as a system; instead, we need to focus on an ongoing system of such artifacts. Hence a 4T should evaluate the general category of cognitive organization under investigation, rather than the performance of single specimens. From this comprehensive standpoint, the question is not whether an individual instance could simulate intelligent behavior within the context of a pre-existing sociolinguistic culture developed by the human cognitive type. Instead the key issue is whether the artificial cognitive type itself is capable of producing a comparable sociolinguistic medium. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Artificial intelligence; Chinese room argument; Computational theory of mind; Mental content; Semantic externalism; Turing tests","Chinese room; Cognitive organization; Computational theory of mind; Human being; Intelligent behavior; Mental content; Single specimen; Total turing test; Turing tests; Linguistics; Ontology; Semantics; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865327867

The conclusions these experts reach are of a higher quality and typically made in a shorter amount of time than those of non-experts. Understanding the manifestation of such abilities in terms of both the psychology of expert performance and the underlying neural mechanisms constitutes one of the most challenging problems in the cognitive sciences. Using perceptual templates we show how the amount of contextual information can change significantly even within a given task, the relationship between local and non-local contexts and finally why there is very little correlation between measures of intelligence and level of expertise in many of the most complex tasks performed by humans. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Decision theory; Expertise; Neural networks; Perceptual learning","Cognitive science; Complex task; Contextual information; Expert performance; Expertise; Neural mechanisms; Nonlocal; Perceptual learning; Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Philosophical aspects; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865308723

A due date is determined upon job arrival, and jobs are sequenced on the machine to optimize the sum of weighted lead times with all due dates met. We propose that each ant is associated with a sequence of waiting jobs with quoted due dates. This waiting sequence is constantly updated over time (whenever a job is selected to be processed or a new job arrives). The on-line schedule is constructed by selecting the first job in the waiting list of the ""best"" ant to process (along with its due date) as the machine becomes available. However, for the ant where this job is not the first one in the list, processing it pushes back the waiting jobs positioned before it. If such push back results in a due date violation, this ant will be eliminated. Further, our ACO framework does not include the iterative procedure due to the characteristics of the on-line problem; this is one difference from the traditional ACO framework besides ant elimination. The computational testing on generated instances shows that our ACO algorithm outperforms an existing effective on-line algorithm in the literature. Also, with local search incorporated using the EDD (Earliest Due Date) rule, improvements can be obtained in both computational outcome and time. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ant colony optimization; Due date; Lead time; Metaheuristics; On-line scheduling","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Due dates; Leadtime; Meta heuristics; Online scheduling; Artificial intelligence; Scheduling; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865275286

The deviation of non-optimal solutions from the optimal ones in our test examples is at most 2%. The CPU times required to find the best solutions by BCO are significantly smaller than the corresponding times required by the CPLEX optimization solver.

Personal information stored by different service providers is expected to be combined to make new services. However, specific user records risk being identified from the combined personal information, and the user's sensitive information may be revealed. Also, personal information collected by a service provider must not be disclosed to other service providers because of security issues. Thus, several researchers have been investigating distributed anonymization protocols, which combine the personal information stored by the providers and sanitize it to ensure an anonymity policy with minimum disclosure. However, when providers have different sets of the users, there is a problem that the existence of users in either service provider may be revealed.

The objective is to produce actionable information that is delivered at the right time, easily comprehendible and exportable to other software to assist business decision-making processes. Although the design and development of decision support systems (DSS) has been carried out for over 40 years, DSS still suffer from many limitations such as poor maintainability, poor flexibility and less reusability. The development of the Internet and WWW has helped information systems to overcome those limitations and Web DSS is now an active area of research in business intelligence, impacting significantly on the way information is exchanged and businesses are conducted. However, to remain competitive, companies rely on business intelligence (BI) to continually monitor and analyze the operating environment (both internal and external), to identify potential risks, and to devise competitive business strategies. However, the current Web DSS applications are not able to reason over information present across organizational boundaries which could be incomplete and conflicting. The use of an argumentation-based mechanism has not been explored to address such shortcomings in Web DSS. Argumentation is a kind of commonsense reasoning used by human beings to reach a justifiable conclusion when available information is incomplete and/or inconsistent among participants. In this paper, we propose and elaborate in detail a conceptual framework and formal argumentation-based semantics for Web enabled Intelligent DSS (Web@IDSS). We evaluate the use of argumentative reasoning in Web DSS with the help of a case study, prototype development and future directions. Applications built according to the proposed framework will provide more practical, understandable results to decision makers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques aim to represent the knowledge in a way that can be applied to solving complex problems or supporting decision making processes.

Business Process Management is one of the specific fields in which the use of ontologies has been widely applied. This paper presents SABUMO, a framework based on ontologies that allows experts to represent and share their knowledge with other experts by means of shared and controlled vocabularies. The framework also allows the execution of business processes represented by experts. The execution of this knowledge does not require the installation of complex AI programs.

If OSN users have mobile devices and they are taken into account, every day a vast amount of information is spontaneously generated, creating opportunities for researchers and developers to use, for example, artificial intelligent techniques to explore similarities between friends, to recommend content and to come up with business opportunities. Additionally, OSN and mobile devices can be put together to explore user context to tailor services according to the user environment. However, to apply ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence to OSN can be cumbersome and resource-consuming. Thus, this paper presents a framework to develop intelligent applications on top of existing OSN, helping developers to explore similarities between the users and recommend content, using user context and simple information present on OSN, without compromising resources present in mobile devices. At the end, this paper shows how to develop new applications using the framework exploring user context and semantic concepts defined by the developer. © 2012 ACM.","frameworks; mobile application development; online social networks","Amount of information; Artificial intelligent; Business opportunities; frameworks; Intelligent applications; Mobile application development; New applications; Online social networks; Semantic concept; Simple informations; User context; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent buildings; Mobile computing; Semantics; Ubiquitous computing; Websites; Mobile devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863602159

Currently, the way such changes are made often has a significant impact on the organization's security, productivity, and employee satisfaction. Those who have to make the decisions are put on the spot, and depending on their perspective and circumstances, the decision is biased towards business or security interests. A decision support system for access control policies could mitigate these problems, but to be effective, such a system needs a significant amount of information about specific security and business risks and benefits, and collecting this information requires significant investment. In this paper, we present a participatory approach to collecting this information, which not only reduces cost, but increases effectiveness because it ensures that specific local knowledge and downstream risks are represented and visible to decision-makers. We evaluated our systematically developed decision-support prototype in formative evaluations with employees and decision-makers from a variety of backgrounds. We found that, among others, decision support is highly dependent on the organizational context and that the collected factors need to be contextualized for the contributing individuals. © 2012 ACM.","access control; decision support; security usability","Access control policies; Amount of information; Authorization policy; Business risks; Decision makers; Decision supports; Employee satisfaction; Formative evaluation; Organizational context; Participatory approach; security usability; Significant impacts; Access control; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863584292

The system makes use of prior knowledge about the scene (e.g. an image on a computer screen), to define a probability map of the scene the subject is gazing at, in order to find the most probable location. The proposed system helps in correcting the fixations which are erroneously estimated by the gaze estimation device by employing a saliency framework to adjust the resulting gaze point vector. The system is tested on three scenarios: using eye tracking data, enhancing a low accuracy webcam based eye tracker, and using a head pose tracker. The correlation between the subjects in the commercial eye tracking data is improved by an average of 13.91%. The correlation on the low accuracy eye gaze tracker is improved by 59.85%, and for the head pose tracker we obtain an improvement of 10.23%.

There are, however, quite a few challenges towards achieving seamless operation. Such challenges arise from heterogeneity in infrastructure and coordination mechanism at participant organizations, as well as time and cost associated with recovery from failure. Our research presents foundations for a reliable scheme for recovery from failure of workflow processes spanning through multiple business entities. First, a system model is adapted from the mobile computing literature that serves to establish the requirements to be enforced by each participating organization. In our model, we adopt the Maximal Sequence Path (MSP) approach from Yoo et al. (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 2132:222-236, 2001), as a means of decomposing workflows into mobile agent-driven processes that communicate via web services at each organization. This decomposition ensures defining logical points within the dynamics of a workflow instance for locating accurate and consistent states of the system for recovery in case of a failure. Then, a set of algorithms for various business scenarios are developed and presented as practical solutions. These algorithms are shown to create checkpoints such that the system is always in a globally consistent state. As such, these algorithms constitute a set of standards that can be incorporated in business process management suites that support reliable interorganizational collaboration. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Business process management; Fault tolerance; Mobile computing; Reliability; Workflow management systems","Business process management; Business scenario; Business to business; Consistent state; Coordination mechanisms; Fault-tolerant; Inter-organizational workflows; Interorganizational business process; Interorganizational collaboration; Lecture Notes; Practical solutions; System models; Work-flows; Workflow management systems; Workflow process; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Enterprise resource management; Mobile agents; Mobile computing; Multimedia services; Recovery; Reliability; Web services; Work simplification; Fault tolerance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865388526

An XML representation (ArdenML) may partially address the technical challenges.

In particular, our system is intended to play a vital role in assessing and optimizing emergency response plans for rare but catastrophic events such as the September 11th attacks. While taking an agent-based microscopic simulation approach in a hierarchical framework, we used our model to estimate the effectiveness of alternative evacuation strategies to support emergency response planning as a part of business continuity planning for all private business organizations. The presented model is unique because it considers individuals with disabilities explicitly in terms of speed, ability to negotiate the environment, and normalcy bias depending on type of disability. It is also capable of classifying the environment in terms of accessibility characteristics encompassing various conditions which have been shown to have a disproportionate effect upon the behavior of individuals with disabilities during an emergency. Through a series of simulation experiments, our system identified specific locations (e.g.; the NW landing) on the 3rd floor of the test bed building as possible bottleneck spots under certain conditions (e.g.; the sharp increase in individuals with disabilities among residents). This way, our system provides the architect with tools to test the structure's design to determine how well it meets the identified requirements for emergency evacuation to accommodate this shifting demographic. In particular, our system strongly demonstrated the effectiveness of new emergency evacuation strategies for individuals with disabilities such as assisted evacuations which allows other healthy people to play more active roles compared to traditional strategies in which individuals with disabilities are helplessly waiting for assistants such as fire fighters at the designated area. Our system also revealed that people using wheelchairs and those with lower stamina were at the greatest risk. People with lower stamina such as the elderly, people with chronic health conditions, or those with temporary injuries are at a greater risk mainly because they are not easily identifiable. Ultimately, the proposed DSS system can be used to inform public policy professionals of more effective, evidence-based evacuation planning and environmental design methods based on a better understanding of the behavior of individuals with disabilities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In such machines, faults in one subsystem can cascade and affect the behavior of numerous other subsystems. This complicates the traditional fault monitoring procedures because of the need to train models of the faults that the monitoring system needs to detect and recognize. Unavoidable design defects, quality variations and different usage patterns make it infeasible to foresee all possible faults, resulting in limited diagnostic coverage that can only deal with previously anticipated and modeled failures. This leads to missed detections and costly blind swapping of acceptable components because of one's inability to accurately isolate the source of previously unseen anomalies. To circumvent these difficulties, a new paradigm for diagnostic systems is proposed and discussed in this paper. Its feasibility is demonstrated through application examples in automotive engine diagnostics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automotive engine diagnostics; Distributed anomaly detection; Fault detection and diagnosis","Application examples; Automotive engine; Design defects; Diagnostic coverage; Diagnostic systems; Distributed anomaly detection; Dynamic subsystems; Engineered systems; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault monitoring; Missed detections; Monitoring system; Quality variation; Train model; Usage patterns; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862558730

Most of the current practices of process mining are based on event logs from Transactional Information Systems (TIS) (such as WFM, ERP, CRM, SCM and B2B systems). However, with the popular deployment and use of business rule engine with TIS, a great number of rule logs are generated, but they are rarely utilized for discovering processes. This paper intends to propose a different perspective for process discovery as compared with the traditional way based on the event logs. Firstly, it illustrates a motivation scenario about process mining from rule logs and then brings forward a framework for process discovery based on rule logs. After that, the mining algorithm called Alpha-r with a case study is introduced to discover a process through mining the relations of traces in rule flow log.

The proposed concept is derived from the idea of education embedded in modern standard-English discourse. Because the standard concept entails that an educable entity must be capable of consciousness and voluntary action, it cannot apply to computers. If, therefore, one is to have an idea of educable computers, one must drop the feature of consciousness and omit or modify that of voluntariness. The advanced concept leaves out consciousness, alters the ordinary notion of voluntariness, but keeps in tact the other criteria of the standard idea.

Apart from traditional collaborative and content-based methods, a number of classification and clustering algorithms have been used for user profiling. Instance Based Learner (IBL) classifier is a comprehensive form of the Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithm and it is suitable for user profiling as users with similar profiles are likely to share similar personal interests and preferences. In IBL every attribute has an equal effect on the classification regardless of their relevance. In this paper, we proposed a weighted classification method, namely Weighted Instance Based Learner (WIBL), to build and handle user profiles. With WIBL, we introduce Per Category Feature (PCF) method to IBL in order to distinguish the effect of attributes on classification. PCF is an attribute weighting method and it assigns weights to attributes using conditional probabilities. The direct use of this method with IBL is not possible. Hence, two possible solutions were also proposed to address this problem. This study is aimed to test the performance of WIBL for user profiling. To validate the performance of WIBL, a series of computer simulations were carried out. These simulations were conducted using a large user profile database that includes 5000 training and 1000 test instances (users). Here, each user is represented with three sets of profile information; demographic, interest and preference data. The results illustrate that WIBL with PCF methods performs better than IBL on user profiling by reducing the error up to 28% on the selected dataset. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Attribute weighting; Classification and clustering; Classification methods; Conditional probabilities; Content-based methods; Data sets; Direct use; Nearest neighbour; Possible solutions; Preference data; Products and services; Test instances; User profile; User profiling; User satisfaction; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Computer simulation; Information science",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862747773

The main goal of this paper is in fact to build artificial agents whose behavior mimic that of experimental agents. Two are the results worth to be mentioned. First, the heuristic approach could provide for a valid alternative micro-foundation for the financial decisions of entrepreneurs. Secondly, financial behaviors could mainly depend on the volatility of demand and on the accuracy of demand forecasts instead of depending on the business cycle phases as usually pointed out by models inspired by Minsky's economic thought.","Differential evolution; Experimental economics; Firms financial decision; Heuristic optimization","Artificial agents; Business cycles; Computational economics; Demand forecast; Differential Evolution; Experimental economics; Financial decisions; Heuristic approach; Heuristic optimization; Micro-foundation; Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithms; Heuristic methods; Industry; Finance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862165240

Right now, hundreds of universities, corporations, and governments are spending billions researching and developing intelligent robotic systems for use in automation, military, medicine, electronics, food and beverage, service and a host of other industries. There is no doubt that robotic systems will play a major role in shaping the future of the world and as research and industry merge, progress in robotics technology will advance several times beyond the current level. This progress will be driven by a need to not only make life easier for consumers, but also to improve communities and even nations as a whole. The market for wireless robots and robotic systems far exceeds the current utilization and as technology advances, the use of robots will be incorporated primarily or indirectly in almost all fields. Of course the most interesting application is use of mobile and communicative robotic systems in everyday life. The possibilities are limited only by human creativity and intellect - the driving force that can turn this industry into the forerunner for an autonomous robot assisted future. Two of the most important areas for furthering the wide scale adaption of robotics are ""autonomous mobility"" and ""wireless communications"". The field of endeavor by which robotic systems communicate wirelessly is known as Wireless Robotics. Advances in the field of Wireless Robotics are necessary to further the growth of robotic systems and their use in everyday life. Research and development in this field needs to progress more rapidly in order to see faster adoption of robots in everyday life. One way to stimulate this growth is by leveraging expertise on a global scale. But for people to cooperate in a global environment and be able to design systems without running into compatibility issues, standards are necessary.

In the last two decades, several researchers have shown that, to deal with many application domains, user-defined temporal granularities must be coped with. When data are stored at multiple user-defined temporal granularities, the task of defining proper conversion functions to aggregate data from an origin granularity (e.g., business days) to a task granularity (e.g., months) is of primary importance. However, current temporal database approaches mostly demand such a task to system administrators, or to specific applications, providing no methodology or general guideline to accomplish it. In this paper, we propose a general and application-independent methodology which, on the basis of the temporal relationship between two user-defined granularities, provides users with a set of conversion/aggregation functions between them, consistent with the telic vs. atelic character of the data to be aggregated. The correctness of the approach is also proved. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Telic/atelic data; Temporal aggregation; Temporal databases; User-defined temporal granularities","Application domains; Conversion function; System administrators; Task granularity; Telic/atelic data; Temporal aggregation; Temporal Database; Temporal granularity; Temporal relationships; Time-varying data; Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862280457

The capability of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to work on a set of solutions allows us to reach different optima in only one run. Nevertheless, simple GAs are not able to maintain different solutions in the last iteration, therefore reaching only one local or global optimum. Research based on the preservation of the diversity through MMGAs has provided very promising results. These techniques, known as niching methods or MMGAs, allow not only to obtain different multiple global optima, but also to preserve useful diversity against convergence to only one solution (the usual behaviour of classical GAs). In previous works, a significant difference in the performance among methods was found, as well as the importance of a suitable parametrization. In this work classic methods are compared to the mostrecent MMGAs, grouped in three classes (sharing, clearing and species competition), for JSSP. Our experimental study found that those new MMGAs which have a certain type of replacement process perform much better (in terms of highest efficacy and multi-solution based efficacy) than classical MMGAs which do not have this type of process. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Genetic algorithms; Multimodal problems Job shop scheduling problem; Niching methods","Experimental studies; Globaloptimum; Job shop scheduling problems; Job-Shop scheduling; Multi-modal; Multiple solutions; Niching genetic algorithm; Niching methods; Parametrizations; Species competition; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided manufacturing; Software engineering; Genetic algorithms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862280370

Moreover, traditional mathematical programming does not incorporate experts' evaluation of providers. This paper employs FANP to obtain experts' scores of the providers, and then integrates the scores into PFIGP to facilitate selection of a 3PL provider with flexible resources. Finally, this paper uses genetic algorithms to solve the PFIGP. An illustrative example is also given to demonstrate such DSS. The test result shows that the degree of providers' interaction affects the final weight of FANP. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Fuzzy analytic network process; Genetic algorithms; Global supply chain; Logistics outsourcing; Preemptive fuzzy integer goal programming","3pl providers; Decision makers; Decision problems; Feasible solution; Flexible resources; Fuzzy analytic network process; Fuzzy integers; Global supply chain; Goal programming; Illustrative examples; Logistics outsourcing; Multi-objective optimization models; Multiple attribute decision makings (MADM); NP Complete; Third party logistics (3PL); Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Multiobjective optimization; Supply chains; Outsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862272173

In addition to their use in social, professional and organizational spheres, social networks are also frequently utilized by researchers in the social sciences, particularly in anthropology and social psychology. In order to obtain information related to a particular social network, analytical techniques are employed to represent the network as a graph, where each node is a distinct member of the network and each edge is a particular type of relationship between members including, for example, kinship or friendship. This article presents a proposal for the efficient solution to one of the most frequently requested services on social networks; namely, taking different types of relationships into account in order to locate a particular member of the network. The solution is based on a biologically-inspired modification of the ant colony optimization algorithm. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","ACO; Dijkstra; Large graphs; Path search; Social networks","ACO; Dijkstra; Large graphs; Path search; Social Networks; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862143177

This facilitates the application of SAT solvers for termination analysis of term rewrite systems (TRSs). We address four main inter-related issues and show how to encode them as satisfiability problems of propositional formulas that can be efficiently handled by SAT solving: (A) the lexicographic comparison w.r.t. a permutation of the arguments; (B) the multiset extension of a base order; (C) the combined search for a path order together with an argument filter to orient a set of inequalities; and (D) how the choice of the argument filter influences the set of inequalities that have to be oriented (so-called usable rules).

The procedure is based on the choice of the set of sampling stations which maximizes the monitored volume of water while keeping the number of stations at minimum. The optimization model is formulated in terms of integer programming, and the solution of the mathematical problem is efficiently approximated by means of a multi-objective multi-colony ant algorithm. A built-in routine is developed for calculation of the water fraction matrix and integrated into the general modeling structure to facilitate data entry and storage to minimize problems associated with water fraction matrix determination for varying scenarios and coverage criteria for any scenario. The proposed methodology is very robust in analyzing the effects of different scenarios and/or number of potential monitoring stations by eliminating the need of employing an off-line routine for coverage matrix identification. Robustness, ease of generalization, multi-objective nature, and computational efficiency are the main characteristics and novelty of the proposed approach.

This paper is part of the larger research project called ETICA (Ethical Issues of Emerging Information and Communication Technologies), a collaborative project funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Union. On the basis of the analysis of around 100 published sources, which dealt with various aspects of selected ICTs, conclusions have been drawn regarding gender issues and concerns that the applications of these ICTs may cause. The authors' analysis is theoretically informed by critical discourse analysis (CDA) which assumes that texts, both written and spoken, as well as other forms of symbolic representations, are indicative of social practices. Of particular methodological relevance was the survey of methods of text and discourse analysis presented in Titscher et al. and especially the application of keyword search as a way to measure the prominence of each investigated method. This approach to literature surveying proved very useful in selecting analytic material: only those published sources on the selected four ICTs have been included in the survey, for which the analysis of keywords, abstracts and indexes of terms indicated authors' interest in gender issues. First, ICTs such as affective computing, ambient intelligence, and artificial intelligence, have been found to have the potential of positively affecting gender power relations and thus positively affecting gender balance in the areas of labour market related to ICT across EU countries and worldwide. Second, more research on the relationship between gender and ICT design, application and representation is needed, so as to enhance a better understanding of ethical issues resulting from unequal participation of women and men in all aspects of ICT production and implementation, which in itself is an ethical dilemma with which both the ICT business and legislators have to grapple. The paper offers insight into the relationship between the level of attention devoted to particular ICTs by ICT researchers, as evidenced in the reviewed literature, and the likelihood of the application of a particular ICT in the future, which is looked at and assessed from a gender perspective. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Communication technologies; Ethics; Gender; Information and communication technology; Information technology",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993099327

These modeling problems are characterized by the two aspects: the model needs to optimize a business objective which may be nonstandard, and the rate of occurence of the event to be modeled may be very low. Traditional methods such as logistic regression are ill-equipped to deal with nonstandard objectives and low event rates. Methods which deal with the low event rate problem by learning on biased samples face the problem of overlearning. We propose a parallel genetic algorithm method that addresses these challenges. Each parallel process evolves propensity models based on a different biased sample, while a mechanism for validation and cross-pollination between the islands helps address the overlearning issue. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a real-life dataset. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Business objectives; Consumer finance; Data sets; Logistic regressions; Modeling problems; Parallel genetic algorithms; Parallel process; Evolutionary algorithms; Logistics; Soft computing; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860700571

These decision support systems usually use a data warehouse to store data and OLAP tools to visualize query results. A specific feature of sales forecasting systems regarding future predictions modification is backward propagation of updates, which is the computation of the impact of modifications on summaries over base data. In Data warehouses, some methods propagate updates in hierarchies when data sources are subject to modifications. However, very few works have been devoted so far, regarding update propagation from summaries to data sources. This paper proposes an algorithm called PAM (Propagation of Aggregate Modification), to efficiently propagate modifications on summaries over base data.

Improvements in database's technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is knowledge discovery, i.e. patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. The knowledge that becomes available through data mining enables an asset owner to make important decisions about life cycle costs in advance. In maintenance field, CMMS (Computer maintenance management system) and CM (Condition Monitoring) are the most popular software available in the industries. Since first one stores all historical data, maintenance actions, events and ma nufacturer recommendations, second one collects and stores all critical physical parameters (vibration, temperature.) to be monitored in a regular time basis. However, converting these data into useful information is a challenge. The degradation process of a system may be affected by many unknown factors, such as unidentified fault modes, unmeasured operational conditions, engineering variance, environmental conditions, etc. These unknown factors not only complicate the degradation behaviors of the system, but also make it difficult to collect quality data. Due to lack of knowledge and incomplete measurements, certain important con text information (e.g. fault modes, operational conditions) of the collected data will be missing. Therefore, historical data of the system with a large variety of degradation patterns will be mixed together. With such data, learning a global model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction becomes extremely hard since the end user does not have enough and good-quality data to model properly the system. This has led us to look for advanced RUL prediction techniques beyond the traditional RUL prediction models. The degradation process for many engineering systems, especially mechanical systems, is irreversible unless the condition is recovered by effective maintenance actions. The irreversible degradation process does not necessarily imply that the observed features will exhibit a monotonic progression pattern during degradation. Such progression pattern is sometimes hard to model using parametric methods. Considering a degradation process involving no or limited maintenance, the process may compose of a sequence of irreversible stages (either discrete or continuous) from new to be worn out, which can be implicitly expressed by the trajectory of the measured condition data or features. Therefore, the RUL of the system can be estimated if its future degradation trend can be projected from those historical instances. In this paper, a novel RUL prediction method inspired by feature maps and SVM classifiers is proposed. The historical instances of a system with life-time condition data are used to create a classification by SVM hyper planes. For a test instance of the same system, whose RUL is going to be estimated, degradation speed is evaluated by computing the minimal distance defined based on the degradation trajectories, i.e. the approach of the system to the hyper plane that segregates good and bad condition data at a different time horizon. Therefore, the final RUL of a specific component can be estimated, and global RUL information can then be obtained by aggregating the multiple RUL estimations using a density estimation method. Proposed model develops an effective RUL prediction method that addresses multiple challenges in complex system prognostics, where many parameters are unknown. Similarities between degradation trajectories can be checked in order to enrich existing methodologies in prognostic's applications. Existing CM data for bearings will be used to verify the model. © 2012 IEEE.","degradation speed; features; maintenance; RUL; SVM","Computing performance; Degradation behavior; Degradation patterns; Degradation process; Degradation trend; Density estimation methods; End users; Engineering systems; Environmental conditions; Fault modes; Feature map; features; Global models; Historical data; Hyper-plane; Incomplete measurements; Intelligent data analysis; Irreversible degradation; Life-times; Lifecycle costs; Maintenance Action; Maintenance management systems; Mechanical systems; Minimal distance; Operational conditions; Parametric method; Physical parameters; Prediction methods; Prediction model; Prediction techniques; Quality data; Remaining useful life predictions; Robust algorithm; RUL; Specific component; SVM; SVM classifiers; Test instances; Text information; Time horizons; Artificial intelligence; Condition monitoring; Coordinate measuring machines; Data mining; Estimation; Forecasting; Maintainability; Maintenance; Mathematical models; Trajectories; Degradation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860635468

Nowadays it denotes the media environment and the communication of information in ubiquitous and pervasive environments. With the addition of intelligence, the new field of semantic ambient media was established. In recent years, the field of semantic ambient media has spread its span from only a few sub-areas, such as ambient advertising, to new ones, such as ambient-assisted living (AAL) and health-monitoring media, significantly supported by intelligence. The study presented in this paper provides an advanced introduction to the field of semantic ambient media including the solutions for threat issues and illustration of success stories of the field. It conducts a survey of the related work and presents a thorough discussion of it. The related work is grouped according to the coverage of the principles of semantic ambient media. Based on the state-of-the-art research, the future possibilities of the field are demonstrated, especially for the ambient-assisted living, audio-visual rendering of media objects, user design principles and the society impact of the field.

(teak), were incubated on a semi-solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 2% (w/v) sucrose, and supplemented with 4.44 μM 6-benzyladenine (BA). These were then transferred to a temporary immersion system (TIS) using liquid MS medium supplemented with 0 (CK-free medium), 2.22, 4.44, 6.66 μM BA. High mean numbers of shoots per explant were obtained when explants were grown on medium containing either 4.44 or 6.66 μM BA and yielding 7.7 and 10.3 normal shoots (NS)/explant, respectively. Moreover, these high BA levels contributed to lower accumulation of phenolic compounds and deposition of lignin in vascular cells of the teak shoots following histochemical analysis. Morphological analysis of proliferating shoots by scanning microscopy revealed that leaves of shoots incubated on either CK-free medium, 2.22, or 4.44 μM BA had elliptical stomata; whereas, stomata of leaves of shoots grown on medium containing 6.66 μM BA were primarily ring-shaped, raised, and open. Moreover, misshapen stomata with broken epidermal layers of guard cells, typical of hyperhydric leaves, were also observed. When shoots were rooted ex vitro by dipping in 492.1 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) for 2 min, the frequency of rooting of shoots previously grown on either CK-free medium or 2.22 μM BA (96.7 and 91.7%, respectively) was higher than that of shoots grown on semi-solid medium (73%). Shoots from both TIS treatments developed good root systems, and all plantlets (100%) survived transfer to soil mix and acclimatization in the greenhouse.

The operation of convenience stores (CVS) in Taiwan is facing a crossover revolution by providing multiple services, including daily fresh foods, a café, ticketing, and a grocery. Therefore, forecasting the daily sales of fresh foods is getting more and more complex due to the influence of both internal and external factors. Eventually, a reliable sales-forecasting system will play an important role in improving business strategies and increasing competitive advantages. The purpose of this study is the development of an enhanced hybrid sales-forecasting model of fresh foods, called ECFM (Enhanced Cluster and Forecast Model), for CVSs by combining a self-organization map (SOM) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The model is evaluated for a six-month sales data set of daily fresh foods at a chained CVS in Taiwan. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed model is compared with that of fuzzy neural network (FNN) and cluster and forecast model (CFM). The result reveals that the proposed model is not only amenable but can also promise the fresh food sales forecasting for CVSs.

Decision making is difficult because of two main factors: first, there is lack of prediction tools that help managers and other stakeholders assess the potential impacts of management changes; second, decisions or management strategies affect multiple social and ecological outcomes and picking the best among sets of multiple outcomes is a complex task. Resource management and stakeholder dialogue can be greatly improved by addressing these problems. In this paper, we propose a decision support system (DSS) for assessing management strategies. The DSS incorporates an integrated agent-based simulation model for tackling the first obstacle and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach to facilitate multi-criteria decision making.The agent-based simulation model incorporates recreational fishing behaviour within a reef ecosystem. Angler behaviour is driven by empirically estimated site choice models which link recreational choices to site attributes and angler characteristics. Coral reef ecosystem dynamics is modelled using a trophic-dynamic model describing the relationship among fish populations, fishing activities as well as algal and coral growth. The second component of the DSS, the AHP-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation part, allows one to combine resource managers' preferences with simulated economic and ecosystem outcomes in the assessment of alternative strategies. A fuzzy multi-criteria, multi-layer evaluation method is used to obtain final ranking.As a case study for this paper, we focus on the management of recreational fishing sites from the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia. A set of management strategies, including a "" business-as-usual"" strategy and alternative site closure strategies are assessed using the proposed DSS. The site closure strategies evaluated vary in length and timing. Further, these evaluations are undertaken for two fishing pressure scenarios (high and low). We illustrate the usefulness of the DSS by evaluating these strategies. We also present some results from a sensitivity analysis focussing on changes in preferences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based model; AHP; Area closure; Decision support system; Fuzzy evaluation; Multiple criteria decision making; Non-market valuation; Random utility model; Recreational fishing","Agent-based model; AHP; Area closure; Decision supports; Fuzzy evaluation; Multiple criteria decision making; Non-market valuation; Random utility model; Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Computer simulation; Decision support systems; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Fuzzy set theory; Hierarchical systems; Managers; Population statistics; Reefs; Sensitivity analysis; Decision making; angling; coral reef; decision making; decision support system; fuzzy mathematics; hierarchical system; management practice; marine park; numerical model; resource management; sensitivity analysis; stakeholder; valuation; Australia; Ningaloo Marine Park; Western Australia; algae; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856380754

There are few researches on the dynamic verification of temporal constraints in an incremental way. In this paper, we present an approach to incremental analysis of temporal constraints. Firstly, after each operation performed by designers, the old change regions before the operation and the new change regions after the operation are generated by comparing the old and new Time Workflow nets (TWF-nets) of processes. Secondly, the sprouting graph recording time and path information of old TWF-net is maintained efficiently to the new state, instead of re-constructing a new sprouting graph. Finally, temporal violations are checked and the paths with violations are reported to designers. This approach is particularly applicable and efficient in terms of time and space for large-scale and complex processes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Incremental analysis; Sprouting graphs; Temporal constraints; Time Workflow nets","Business environments; Change region; Complex Processes; Dynamic verifications; Incremental analysis; Incremental approach; Process model; Sprouting graphs; Temporal constraints; Workflow management systems; Workflow nets; Workflow process; Artificial intelligence; Work simplification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859707053

Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation (P-ACO) in order to obtain the non-dominated set of different SC designs was utilized as the guidance for designing manufacturing SC. PACO explores the solution space on the basis of applying the Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm and implementing more than one pheromone matrix, one for every objective. The SC design problem has been addressed by using Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation in which two objectives are minimised simultaneously. There were tested two ways in which the quantity of pheromones in the PM is incremented. In the SPM, the pheromone increment is a function of the two objectives, cost and time, while in MPM the pheromone matrix is divided into two pheromones, one for the cost and another one for the time. It could be concluded that the number of solutions do not depend on if the pheromone is split or is a function of the two variables because both method explore the same solution space. Although both methods explore the same solution space, the POS generated by every one is different. The POS that is generated when the pheromone matrix is split got solutions with lower time and cost than SMP because in the probabilistic decision rule a value of λ = 0.2 is used. It means that the ants preferred solution with a low cost instead of solutions with low time. The strategy of letting the best-so-far ant deposit pheromone over the PM accelerates the algorithm to get the optimal POS although the number of ants in the colony is small. An experimental example is used to test the algorithm and show the benefits of utilising two pheromone matrices and multiple ant colonies in SC optimisation problem. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Ant colony; Meta-heuristics; Multi-objective optimisation; Supply chain design","Ant colonies; Ant colony optimisation; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Changing business environment; Customer demands; Deposit pheromone; Design problems; Low costs; Meta heuristics; Multi-objective optimisation; Optimisations; Preferred solutions; Probabilistic decisions; Product mix; Solution space; Supply chain design; Artificial intelligence; Hormones; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Supply chains; Algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859185338

In the case of disordered porous media analysis, however, neither is really efficient since the internal geometry of the object is usually composed of both rod and plate shapes. This paper presents an alternative to compute a hybrid shape-dependant skeleton and its application to porous media. The resulting skeleton combines 2D surfaces and 1D curves to represent respectively the plate-shaped and rod-shaped parts of the object. For this purpose, a new technique based on neural networks is proposed: cascade combinations of complex wavelet transform (CWT) and complex-valued artificial neural network (CVANN). The ability of the skeleton to characterize hybrid shaped porous media is demonstrated on a trabecular bone sample. Results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy rates about 99.78%-99.97%.

Outputs of a CBM model include the calculation of optimal maintenance decisions, conditional reliability, and the calculation of remaining useful life, among other measures. It is necessary to have a model for the manner in which the condition monitoring data changes over time to produce these output measures; many models have been developed to do so. It is also common to record minor maintenance actions carried out on critical assets, with lubricant changes being one of the most common, but it is unusual for models to consider the impact of such maintenance actions that affect the condition monitoring data.

Each stream contains more than one thread usually. Detecting threads in the streams is helpful to various applications, such as business intelligence, investigation of crime and public opinion analysis. Existing works which are mainly based on text similarity encounter many challenges including the sparse eigenvector and anomaly of short text message. This paper introduces a novel concept of contextual correlation instead of the traditional text similarity into single-pass clustering algorithm to cover the challenges of thread detection. We firstly analyze the contextually correlative nature of conversations in short text message streams, and then propose an unsupervised method to compute the correlative degree. As a reference, a single-pass algorithm employing the contextual correlation is developed to detect threads in massive short text stream. Experiments on large real-life online chat logs show that our approach improves the performance by 11% when compared with the best similarity-based algorithm in terms of F1 measure. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Contextual correlation; Short text; Text stream; Thread detection","Chat logs; Instant messaging; Novel concept; Public opinions; Short message services; Short text; Single-pass algorithm; Text messages; Text similarity; Text streams; Unsupervised method; Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Clustering algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862198872

Most previous work on web news article extraction focuses only on content. To meet a growing demand for web data integration applications, more useful news attributes, such as title, publication date, author, etc., need to be extracted from news pages and stored in a structured way for further processing. An automatic unified approach to extract such attributes based on their visual features, including independent and dependent visual features, is proposed. Unlike conventional methods, such as extracting attributes separately or generating template-dependent wrappers, the basic idea of this approach is twofold. First, candidates for each news attribute are extracted from the page based on their independent visual features. Second, the true value of each attribute is identified from the candidates based on dependent visual features such as the layout relationships among the attributes. Extensive experiments with a large number of news pages show that the proposed approach is highly effective and efficient. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Markov Logic Networks; News article; Visual feature; Web data extraction","Conventional methods; Growing demand; Markov logic networks; News articles; Unified approach; Visual feature; Web data extraction; Web data integration; Information systems; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862198439

In the location model, the fire units are considered as the facilities to be located and the possible approach routes of air vehicles are treated as demand points. Considering the probability that fire by the units will miss the targets, the objective of the problem is to determine the positions that provide coverage of the approach routes of the maximum number of weapons while considering the military principles regarding the tactical use and deployment of units. In comparison with the conventional method, the proposed methodology presents a more reliable, faster, and more efficient solution. On the other hand, owing to the DSS, a battery commander who is responsible for air defence becomes capable of determining the optimal weapon and radar positions, among the alternative ones he has identified, that cover the possible approach routes maximally.

Oftentimes, talk events are distributed through email lists. These local email lists, to some extent, represent diverse groups of research interests or methodologies. However, as research in neuroscience becomes more and more interdisciplinary, the abundance of local email lists has started to impede information dissemination. Not every talk host is aware of the existence of all the other email lists. As a result, a talk announcement may be sent to popular email lists, but does not necessarily reach all potential event attendees in the area.

Farmers can obtain corresponding data from hyperspectral measurements of plants, which record spectrums of several hundred wavelengths. This data contains information about changes in a plant's pigment composition, which indicates metabolic processes involved in responses to biotic or abiotic stress.","agriculture; computational intelligence; computational sustainability; sensor-equipped computing devices","A plants; Abiotic stress; Computing devices; Control applications; Human drivers; HyperSpectral; John Deere; Knowledge-intensive industries; Light reflectance; Metabolic process; New forms; Nitrogen levels; Pigment composition; Satellite signals; Artificial intelligence; Information dissemination; Intelligent systems; Ubiquitous computing; Agriculture",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860493217

Despite the industrial need for efficient and effective resource allocation in BPM, few scientifically-grounded approaches exist to support these initiatives. In this paper, a new approach of resource allocation optimization is proposed, built on the concepts that is part of an operation-oriented view on process optimization. Essentially, the proposed approach automatically generates a specific task operation model (TOM) for a particular business process. In addition, in order to support end users in making sensible resource allocations, an ant colony optimization-based algorithm is presented, which makes it possible to search an optimal task operation path on the generated TOM. This allows one to suggest how a business user should efficiently allocate resources to perform the tasks of a particular process case. The feasibility of the presented approach is demonstrated by a simulation experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms reasonable heuristic approaches to satisfy process performance goals, and it is possible to improve the current state of BPM. © 2012 IEEE.","Ant colony optimization (ACO); business process; optimization; resource allocation; task operation model (TOM)","Ant colonies; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Business Process; Business process management; Business-users; End users; Heuristic approach; Integral part; Operation model; Optimization-based algorithm; Process performance; Process-aware information systems; Resource allocation optimization; Simulation experiments; Specific tasks; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Enterprise resource management; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Resource allocation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865407033

A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can increase the likelihood of detecting cardiac diagnoses such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this diagnostic test as part of the screening process has engendered considerable controversy. The pro position is supported by argument that international screening protocols support its use, positive diagnosis has multiple benefits, history and physical examination are inadequate, primary prevention is essential, and the cost effectiveness is justified. Although the aforementioned myriad of justifications for routine ECG screening of young athletes can be persuasive, several valid contentions oppose supporting such a policy, namely, that the sudden death incidence is very (too) low, the ECG screening will be too costly, the false-positive rate is too high, resources will be allocated away from other diseases, and manpower is insufficient for its execution. Clinicians, including pediatric cardiologists, have an understandable proclivity for avoiding this prodigious national endeavor. The controversy, however, should not be focused on whether an inexpensive, noninvasive test such as an ECG should be mandated but should instead be directed at just how these tests for young athletes can be performed in the clinical imbroglio of these disease states (with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression) with concomitant fiscal accountability and logistical expediency in this era of economic restraint. This monumental endeavor in any city or region requires two crucial elements well known to business scholars: implementation and execution. The eventual solution for the screening ECG dilemma requires a truly innovative and systematic approach that will liberate us from inadequate conventional solutions. Artificial intelligence, specifically the process termed ""machine learning"" and ""neural networking,"" involves complex algorithms that allow computers to improve the decision-making process based on repeated input of empirical data (e.g., databases and ECGs). These elements all can be improved with a national database, evidence-based medicine, and in the near future, innovation that entails a Kurzweilian artificial intelligence infrastructure with machine learning and neural networking that will construct the ultimate clinical decision-making algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Screening 12-lead electrocardiogram; Sudden cardiac death","artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; athlete; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; clinical decision making; complete heart block; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetes mellitus; electrocardiogram; evidence based medicine; exercise; false positive result; family history; gene expression; health care cost; heart protection; heart right ventricle dysplasia; human; hypertension; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; long QT syndrome; machine learning; medical history; obesity; pediatrician; phenotype; physical examination; review; screening test; short QT syndrome; sudden death; Wolff Parkinson White syndrome; age; consumer; electrocardiography; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; instrumentation; mass communication; methodology; primary prevention; sports medicine; sudden death; Age Factors; Artificial Intelligence; Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic; Consumer Participation; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Diffusion of Innovation; Electrocardiography; Humans; Physical Examination; Primary Prevention; Sports Medicine",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862693690

Folder allocation for text documents in computer is typically executed manually by the user. Every time the user creates text documents by using text editors or downloads the documents from the internet, and wishes to store these documents on the computer, the user needs to determine and allocate the appropriate folder in which to store these new documents. This situation is inconvenient as repeating the folder allocation each time a text document is stored becomes tedious especially when the numbers and layers of folders are huge and the structure is complex and continuously growing. This problem can be overcome by implementing Artificial Intelligence machine learning methods to classify the new text documents and allocate the most appropriate folder as the storage for them.

Such attack combines vulnerabilities existing on different systems/ services and are potentially more harmful than single point attacks. One of the methods for analyzing such security vulnerabilities in an enterprise network is the use of attack graph. It is a complete graph which gives a succinct representation of different attack scenarios, depicted by attack paths. An attack path is a logical succession of exploits, where each exploit in the series satisfies the preconditions for subsequent exploits and makes a causal relationship among them. Thus analysis of the attack graph may help in assessing network security from hackers' perspective. One of the intrinsic problems with the generation and analysis of such a complete attack graph is its scalability. In this work, an approach based on Planner, a special purpose search algorithm from artificial intelligence domain, has been proposed for time-efficient, scalable representation of the attack graphs. Further, customized algorithms have been developed for automatic generation of attack paths (using Planner as a low-level module). The analysis shows that generation of attack graph using the customized algorithms can be done in polynomial time. A case study has also been presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Attack graph; Attack path; Exploit; Network security; Planner","Attack graph; Attack path; Automatic Generation; Causal relationships; Complete graphs; Cyber-attacks; Different attacks; Enterprise networks; Exploit; Planner; Polynomial-time; Search Algorithms; Security vulnerabilities; Single point; Succinct representation; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Network security; Personal computing; Polynomial approximation; Graph theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862137813

This knowledge includes design-time information like: (i) the goal of a task and (ii) the alternative ways for a human to achieve that goal, as well as run-time information such as the choices made by a human during task execution. In order to provide effective support, the agent must know exactly what steps the human is following. However, if not all steps along the path can be observed, it is possible that the agent cannot uniquely derive which path the human is following. Furthermore, in order to provide timely support, the agent must observe, reason, conclude and support within a limited period of time. To deal with these problems, this paper presents a generic focused reasoning mechanism to enable a guided selection of the path which is most likely followed by the human.

The workflow definitions of these processes are frequently reused within the organizations. The reuse of these workflow definitions can be easier if they are divided into three separate but related definitions: on the one hand, the definition of the data structures to be managed by the process activities, on the other, the users that can perform each activity and, finally, the process activities together with the relationships among the three definitions. The use of ontologies can facilitate these workflow definitions in the three related parts. In this paper, we describe OntoMetaWorkflow, a generic ontology to represent canonical workflow terms in the domain of administrative processes, and the methods for using it in defining administrative processes. This ontology is the basis of the WEAPON Model, a complete model supported by tools, for defining and managing administrative process workflows. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","administrative process; Business process; ontologies; OntoMetaWorkflow; WEAPON; workflows","Administrative process; Business Process; OntoMetaWorkflow; WEAPON; Work-flows; Artificial intelligence; Ontology; Software engineering; Data structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861880169

Although laypersons commonly perceive causality as being transitive, some philosophers have questioned this assumption, and models of causality in artificial intelligence are often agnostic with respect to transitivity. We consider two formal models of causation that differ in the way they represent uncertainty. The quantitative model uses a crude probabilistic definition, arguably the common core of more sophisticated quantitative definitions; the qualitative model uses a definition based on nonmonotonic consequence relations. Different sufficient conditions for the transitivity of causation are laid bare by the two models: The Markov condition on events for the quantitative model, and a so-called saliency condition (A is perceived as a typical cause of B) for the qualitative model. We explore the formal and empirical relations between these sufficient conditions, and between the underlying definitions of perceived causation. These connections shed light on the range of applicability of each model, contrasting commonsense causal reasoning (supposedly qualitative) and scientific causation (more naturally quantitative). These speculations are supported by a series of three behavioral experiments. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behavioral experiments; Causation; Conditional independence; Non-monotonic reasoning; Transitivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861226564

In particular, it focuses on the automatic classification of regions of interest (ROIs) in two classes, namely oil spills or look-alikes. Candidate regions and the corresponding boundaries have been manually identified from full resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images, related to the Mediterranean Sea over the years 2008 and 2009. Then, a set of features has been extracted from each ROI, allowing to formulate the oil spill detection problem as a two-class classification task on the provided regions (i.e. using a supervised learning strategy). Since ROI classification is challenging, some desired characteristics for the classification algorithm are first identified, such as accuracy, robustness, etc. Then, a solution (called SVME) is provided: it is based on an ensemble of incremental/decremental cost-oriented Support Vector Machines, aggregated with the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) convex hull method in the ROC space. Such a solution addresses all the desired characteristics. Finally, the results obtained on the collected dataset are shown. The importance of this study is the devising of a powerful classification technique that may have an impact on optical oil spill detection from space, especially if fused with satellite synthetic aperture radar data. Moreover, it is shown how the proposed system can be used as a decision support tool, to help a junior operator in making more reliable detections. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Classifier ensemble; Decision support systems; Incremental and decremental learning; Multi-spectral optical remotely sensed images; Oil spill detection; Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC); ROC convex hull; Support Vector Machines (SVMs); Time-varying two-class classification","Classifier ensembles; Convex hull; Incremental and decremental learning; Oil spill detection; Receiving operating characteristics; Remotely sensed images; Time varying; Artificial intelligence; Computational geometry; Decision support systems; Geometrical optics; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Oil spills; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data set; image classification; machinery; MODIS; oil spill; optical method; radar; remote sensing; resolution; satellite imagery; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861100993

The activity was the first at-sea test of the recently developed decision support system (DSS) for operation planning, which had previously been tested in an artificial experiment. The DSS assesses the impact of both environmental conditions (meteorological and oceanographic) and non-environmental conditions (such as traffic density maps) on people and assets involved in the operation and helps in deciding a course of action that allows safer operation. More precisely, the environmental variables (such as wind speed, current speed and significant wave height) taken as input by the DSS are the ones forecasted by a super-ensemble model, which fuses the forecasts provided by multiple forecasting centres. The uncertainties associated with the DSS's inputs (generally due to disagreement between forecasts) are propagated through the DSS's output by using the unscented transform. In this way, the system is not only able to provide a traffic light map (run/not run the operation), but also to specify the confidence level associated with each action. This feature was tested on a particular type of operation with underwater gliders: the glider surfacing for data transmission. It is also shown how the availability of a glider path prediction tool provides surfacing options along the predicted path. The applicability to different operations is demonstrated by applying the same system to support diver operations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Decision under risk; Ensemble statistics; Fuzzy logic; Geospatial decision support systems; Uncertainty handling; Underwater gliders; Unscented transform","Ensemble statistics; Geo-spatial; Uncertainty handling; Underwater gliders; Unscented transform; Artificial intelligence; Data communication systems; Decision support systems; Experiments; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Gliders; Street traffic control; Uncertainty analysis; autonomous underwater vehicle; data transmission; decision support system; ensemble forecasting; environmental conditions; experimental study; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Ligurian Sea; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861040705

We answer both of these questions in the positive, based on an extensive literature study of existing arguments. Our contribution consists in bringing together and reinterpreting pieces of information from a variety of sources. One of the conclusions drawn is that artifactual morality must come in degrees and depend on the level of agency, autonomy and intelligence of the machine. Moral concerns for agents such as intelligent search machines are relatively simple, while highly intelligent and autonomous artifacts with significant impact and complex modes of agency must be equipped with more advanced ethical capabilities. Systems like cognitive robots are being developed that are expected to become part of our everyday lives in future decades. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that their behaviour is adequate. In an analogy with artificial intelligence, which is the ability of a machine to perform activities that would require intelligence in humans, artificial morality is considered to be the ability of a machine to perform activities that would require morality in humans. The capacity for artificial (artifactual) morality, such as artifactual agency, artifactual responsibility, artificial intentions, artificial (synthetic) emotions, etc., come in varying degrees and depend on the type of agent. As an illustration, we address the assurance of safety in modern High Reliability Organizations through responsibility distribution. In the same way that the concept of agency is generalized in the case of artificial agents, the concept of moral agency, including responsibility, is generalized too. We propose to look at artificial moral agents as having functional responsibilities within a network of distributed responsibilities in a socio-technological system. This does not take away the responsibilities of the other stakeholders in the system, but facilitates an understanding and regulation of such networks. It should be pointed out that the process of development must assume an evolutionary form with a number of iterations because the emergent properties of artifacts must be tested in real world situations with agents of increasing intelligence and moral competence. We see this paper as a contribution to the macro-level Requirement Engineering through discussion and analysis of general requirements for design of ethical robots. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artifactual responsibility; Artificial morality; Autonomous agents; Functional responsibility; Machine ethics; Machine morality; Roboethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860417495

One of the key trust modelling activities is trust prediction. During this process, the accuracy and reliability of the predicted trust values play an important role in the making of informed business decisions. Key factors to be considered at this stage are the variability and the high levels of distortion in the input series that have to be captured when predicting the trust values at a point in time in the future. In this paper, we propose a Multi-layer Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network to predict the future trust values of entities (services, agents, products etc.) for a future point in time based on data series input. We use four different non-uniform' data input series and measure the accuracy of the predicted values under different experimental scenarios for benchmarking and comparison with existing approaches. Results indicate that the model is reliable in predicting trust values even in scenarios where there are only limited data available on training the neural network and a high level of distortion is present in the input series. © 2011 The Author.

Temperature data of winter wheat season were also analysed. The Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimate, the sequential version of the Mann-Kendall test, the Pettitt test and spatial and temporal hierarchical cluster analyses were used. First, the datasets were checked for changing points. The 106-year period was divided into two long periods of 100 years each to verify the importance of a very short interval in changing of general trends; after that it was divided into three shorter periods of 35-36 years each. The main conclusions are as follows: the 6 years making up the difference between the two long periods are very important in the context of the recent global warming; the three shorter periods analysis indicate some fluctuations rather than continuous warming. The latest short period is the most relevant for global warming. Spatial hierarchical cluster analysis indicated the existence of two distinctive groups. One of them, which includes stations in the south-east part of the country, seems to be influenced by the Black Sea surface temperature. Temporal hierarchical cluster analysis reveals that annual data series have the closest relation with the summer data series. Further, the impact of temperature changes on winter wheat phenology was determined using a phenology simulation performed with the model from the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer v. 4. 0. 2. 0 platform.

The optimal zoning of protected ecological areas belongs to a NP-hard problem because it is subject to both box and spatial constraints. A challenge in solving area optimization problems emerges with the increasing size of a study region. In this article, an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS and modified ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed for application in zoning protected ecological areas. Significant modifications have been made in the conventional ACO so that it can be further extended to solve zoning problems in large regions. An improved selection strategy is designed to accelerate the progress of sites selection for artificial ants. Another important modification in ACO is to incorporate the neighborhood diffusion strategy into pheromone updating. The optimal objective is to generate protected areas that maximize both ecological suitability and spatial compactness. The modified ACO model has been successfully applied to a case study involving an area of 25,483 cells in Dongguan, Guangdong, China. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model is an efficient and effective optimization technique for generating optimal protection. The modified ACO model only requires approximately 119 s for determining near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method performs better than other methods, including simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, iterative relaxation, basic ACO, and density slicing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","ACO; GIS; Protected ecological areas; Remote sensing; Zoning","artificial intelligence; experimental study; genetic algorithm; GIS; integrated approach; land use change; numerical model; optimization; pheromone; protected area; remote sensing; China; Dongguan; Guangdong; Formicidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856427867

Once implemented and deployed for the first time, new functionalities are added to meet new or changed requirements. Some of these functionalities may appear on the Web in response to an unexpected event, or phenomena (such as a natural calamity) after which they are removed. Some others are activated periodically, to coincide with a particular date, or period of the year (such as, return to school, Christmas holidays, etc.). Implementing such volatile functionalities usually impacts on a number of aspects of a Web application, including content, navigation, presentation, business processes, and user operations. Their cyclic activation/deactivation, which requires repetitive changes in the application code, may be the cause of waste of effort and application quality deterioration, up to incorrect functioning. In this paper, we present an approach to decouple the design and implementation of volatile functionalities from that of stable ones, i.e. the core functionalities of the application. The approach is instantiated in the context of the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method (OOHDM), but its principles and related techniques are generally applicable to any other Web engineering method.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have already been used in multiuser detection in CDMA systems; however, as the pheromone accumulates, we may not get a global optimum because it stops searching early. PDACO can enlarge searching range through increasing the initial population of the ant colony, and the population declines in successive iterations. So, the performance of PDACO is superior with the same computational complexity. PDACO is applied to multiuser detection in asynchronous CDMA systems over slowly multipath Rayleigh-fading channels in this paper. Via computer simulations it is shown that the performance of PDACO detector is much better in bit-error rate and near-far effect resistance than conventional detector, ACO detector and genetic algorithm detector, and is close the optimal multiuser detector. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ant colony optimization; Asynchronous systems; Code division multiple access; Multiuser detection","Ant colonies; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Ant-colony optimization; Asynchronous system; CDMA communications; CDMA system; Code division; Conventional detectors; Global optimum; Initial population; Multi-path; Multi-user; Multi-User Detectors; Near-far effects; Population decline; Rayleigh-fading channel; Successive iteration; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Code division multiple access; Computer simulation; Detectors; Multiuser detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856721299

To overcome this limitation, we propose an integrated DSS framework by combining both business and engineering systems with a dashboard. The dashboard serves as a human-computer interface and allows a decision maker to adjust decision variables and exchange information with the DSS. The proposed framework provides a two-stage decision making mechanism based on optimization and agent-based models. Under the proposed DSS, the decision maker decides on the values of a subset of decision variables. These values, or the first-stage decision, are forwarded through the dashboard to the DSS. For the given set of first-stage decision variables, a multi-objective robust optimization problem, based on an integrated business and engineering simulation model, is solved to obtain the values for a set of second-stage decision variables. The two-stage decision making process iterates until a convergence is achieved. A simple oil refinery case study with an example dashboard demonstrates the applicability of the integrated DSS. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents BASINFORM, a new decision methodology for selecting cost-effective management measures, developed in close co-operation with the water authorities and tested in the 5,154 km 2 mesoscale river Weisse Elster in central Germany. BASINFORM comprises (i) a procedure for framing the specific problems in the water bodies, including quantification of the need for action, (ii) modelling tools for quantifying the impacts of management measures, and (iii) a method for selecting cost-effective combinations of measures. One innovative feature of BASINFORM is that it structures the complex decision problems appropriately for practical use and provides an easy-to-use framework for integrating scientific and practical knowledge. A trial run applying BASINFORM to the Weisse Elster catchment revealed that good surface water status with respect to nutrient levels cannot be achieved if only the ""standard"" actions of current water management are taken to reduce point sources (sewage treatment) and diffuse agricultural sources. It also became clear that the nutrient-reduction measures available will generate considerable costs. The application of BASINFORM in this case study demonstrated its practical applicability in the WFD implementation process. Beyond the case study described here BASINFORM is currently being used for practical implementation of the WFD in the German Federal State of Thuringia. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","BASINFORM; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Decision support system; EU water framework directive; Meta-CANDY; Point and non-point pollution; WASP 5","BASINFORM; Decision supports; Meta-CANDY; Point and non-point pollution; WASP 5; Artificial intelligence; Catchments; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision support systems; Innovation; Nutrients; Sewage treatment; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Decision making; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; decision support system; European Union; implementation process; nonpoint source pollution; point source pollution; water management; Germany",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856007838

In the first step, base classifiers are trained for acceptable accuracy. In the second step, a weight tuning process tunes their weights such that each one can distinguish one class of input data from the others with highest possible accuracy. An evolutionary method is used to optimize efficiency of each base classifier to distinguish one class of input data in this step. In the third step, a new method combines the results of the base classifiers. As diversity is measured and monitored throughout the entire procedure, it is measured using a confusion matrix. Superiority of the proposed method is discussed using several known classifier fusion methods and known benchmark datasets. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Classifier diversity; Classifier fusion; Combining classifiers; Multiple classifier system diversity","Base classifiers; Benchmark datasets; Classifier fusion; Combining classifiers; Confusion matrices; Evolutionary method; Input datas; Multi-layer perception; Multiple classifier systems; Optimize efficiency; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Input output programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855840621

The recent literature has various applications of the FAHP, but these studies lack consistency control, use identical decision support rather than weighted expert choices, and lack measurable criteria. The proposed model, generic fuzzy-AHP (here after GF-AHP), provides a standard control of consistency on the decision matrix for the expert group. GF-AHP also improves the capabilities of the FAHP by executing direct numerical inputs without expert consultation. In practical business, some of the criteria can be easily calculated and expert consultation is a redundant process. Therefore, GF-AHP presents how to transform such numerical inputs to a priority scale. Finally, expertise differences on the decision group are reflected in the GF-AHP process by an expert weighting algorithm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a Geographical Information System-based decision support system was developed to assist fire managers in determining the fastest and the safest or more reliable access routes from firefighting headquarters to fire areas. The decision support system was tested in the Kahramanmaras Forestry Regional Directoratein the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The study area consisted of forested lands which had been classified according to fire sensitivity. The fire response routing simulations considered firefighting teams located in 20 firefighting headquarter locations. The road network, the locations of the firefighting headquarters, and possible fire locations were mapped for simulation analysis. In alternative application simulations, inaccessible roads which might be closed due to fire or other reasons were indicated in the network analysis so that the optimum route was not only the fastest but also the safest and most reliable path. The selection of which firefighting headquarters to use was evaluated by considering critical response time to potential fire areas based on fire sensitivity levels. Results indicated that new firefighting headquarters should be established in the region in order to provide sufficient firefighting response to all forested lands. In addition, building new fire access roads and increasing the design speed on current roads could also increase firefighting response capabilities within the study area. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Firefighting teams; Forest fires; GIS; Network analysis; Safest route; Shortest path","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Deforestation; Electric network analysis; Fire extinguishers; Fire fighting equipment; Fire hazards; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Location; Transportation; Application simulation; Firefighting teams; Firefighting vehicles; Forest fires; GIS based decision support systems; Mediterranean region; Safest routes; Shortest path; Fires; accessibility; decision support system; forest fire; GIS; hazard assessment; network analysis; reliability analysis; safety; article; controlled study; decision support system; fire; fire protection; forest fire; forest structure; geographic information system; simulation; traffic; travel; Turkey (republic); Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Deforestation; Fire Fighting; Forest Fires; GIS; Safety Equipment; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027958815

About the same time, a logician,YehoshuaBar-Hillel, pointed out that AI optimism was based on what he called the ""first step fallacy"". First step thinking has the idea of a successful last step built in. Limited early success, however, is not a valid basis for predicting the ultimate success of one's project. Climbing a hill should not give one any assurance that if he keeps going hewill reach the sky. Perhaps onemay have overlooked some serious problem lying ahead. There is, in fact, no reason to think that we are making progress towards AI or, indeed, that AI is even possible, in which case claiming incremental progress towards it wouldmake no sense. In current excited waiting for the singularity, religion and technology converge. Hard headed materialists desperately yearn for a world where our bodies no longer have to grow old and die. They will be transformed into information, like Google digitizes old books, and we will achieve the promise of eternal life.

Unfortunately, such sources only manage data, rather than the knowledge they carry. Recognizing, extracting, and structuring relevant information according to their semantics is a crucial task. Several approaches in the field of Information Extraction (IE) have been proposed to support the translation of semi-structured/unstructured documents into structured data or knowledge. Most of them have a high precision but, since they are mainly syntactic, they often have a low recall, are dependent on the document format, and ignore the semantics of information they extract. In this paper, we describe a new approach for semantic information extraction that could represent the basis for automatically extracting highly structured data from unstructured web sources without any undesirable trade-off between precision and recall. In short, the approach (i) is ontology driven, (ii) is based on a unified representation of documents, (iii) integrates existing IE techniques, (iv) implements semantic regular expressions, (v) has been implemented through Answer Set Programming, (vi) is employed in real-world applications, and (vii) is having a positive feedback from business customers. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Economic and social effects; Electronic document exchange; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Logic programming; Semantics; Web crawler; Answer set programming; Business customers; Digital information; Document formats; Explosive growth; Precision and recall; Regular expressions; Semantic information extractions; Data mining",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992254987

Facing the disputable question of potential domination of the Artificial Intelligence over the natural one, we should ask whether the improvement of this area of Engineering should be limited. It is worth to be aware that modern Computer Engineering has limitations of its improvement, which are important from the human-centric point of view. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Artificial intelligence; Human factors; Improvement of engineering",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979673919

The research hypothesis is that different conditions and approaches in managing the planning DSS may strengthen either decisional support or the knowledge generation capability. Assuming that a DSS is generally composed of a database, a model and an user interface (Power D.J.

Motivated by the complexity of strategic decision-making within the Climate Change Working Group of the State Government of New South Wales, we conducted a content analysis of IT strategy documentation from 1989 to the present. In our analysis of the resulting concept maps we observe the increasing dynamism and complexity of DSS over this period and suggest that we are now entering a critical era for IS in dealing with such dynamism and complexity. Crucial issues such as climate change now require planning over much longer time frames (up to 100 years) than are currently considered by either government or business. The decision-making of the Working Group calls for the integration of very large data sets and the sharing of information from many different government agencies and external sources. In a pattern of distributed leadership there is an increase in participation from citizens in decision-making for local climate change initiatives often through social media. We re-evaluate DSS not as IS but as a broad ""information infrastructure? which can flexibly and rapidly adapt to the needs of specific projects.","Climate change adaptation; Complexity; Content analysis; Decision support systems; Information infrastructure","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Information systems; Climate change adaptation; Complexity; Content analysis; Decision support system (dss); Government agencies; Historical perspective; Information infrastructures; Strategic decision making; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928175548

However, relatively little research has been done for business network discovery and analysis. Although named entity recognition (NER) tools are available to identify basic entities in texts, there are still challenging research problems, such as co-reference resolution and the identification of abbreviations of organization names. Guided by the design science methodology, the main contribution of this paper is the design and development of a novel semi-supervised method for the identification of business entities (e.g., companies) and their relationships. Based on the automatically mined business networks, financial analysts can then predict the business prestige of companies for better financial investment decision making. Initial experiments show that the proposed business entity identification method is more effective than other baseline methods. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised business relationship mining method is more effective than the state-of-theart supervised machine learning classifier when a large number of manually labeled training examples are not available. The managerial implication is that business managers can apply the design artifacts to promptly identify potential business partners and competitors, and hence improve their strategic business decision marking processes.","Business Network Mining; Named Entity Recognition; Statistical Learning; Text Mining","Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Data mining; Decision making; Design; Investments; Learning systems; Managers; Natural language processing systems; Personnel training; Supervised learning; Text processing; Business networks; Co-reference resolutions; Design science methodologies; Named entity recognition; On-line social networks; Statistical learning; Supervised machine learning; Text mining; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928171254

The daily management of the river is a complex task that needs to take into account not only the demands of water users but also a range of catchment and river processes that are difficult to quantify. This often results in water being released from headwater storages which are surplus to the actual requirements. State Water, the NSW rural bulk water delivery business, supported by Water for Rivers (www.waterforrivers.org.au), have embarked on a £65m upgrade of the river management and operational system for the Murrumbidgee River that will set a benchmark for efficient river operations in Australia and internationally. The Murrumbidgee Computer Aided River Management (CARM) project will make control of water flows and dam releases more precise and efficient through a combination of upgrades to river infrastructure, metering, operational modelling and information systems. As a result, operational efficiency will be realised through improved control of dam releases and reductions in surplus flows. This paper describes the CARM decision support system that has been developed for the Murrumbidgee River, and the series of hydrological and hydraulic models that underpin the system. The CARM system integrates real time data from a number of systems including the Bureau of Meteorology and NSW Office of Water as well as State Water systems, to provide forecasts of future river inflows and automatically update the model state so that it continuously emulates the real river behaviour. The system is capable of automatically providing future operations instructions for the dams and regulation structures, for normal regulated river operations, environmental releases and flood operations. © 2012 Engineers Australia.",,"Artificial intelligence; Catchments; Computer control systems; Decision support systems; Environmental regulations; Hydraulic models; Information management; Real time systems; Rivers; Bureau of meteorologies; Environmental release; Improved controls; Management systems; Operational efficiencies; Operational systems; River infrastructure; River management; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925353122

The game centers on a competitive version of Bejewelled, in which players duel with an artificial intelligence (AI) to create the most “match-three” colored patterns. The problem comes from how the pieces on the game board are created – when, for example, a column of three green orbs is lined up and removed from play, new pieces fall in to take their place. However, sometimes, these three new pieces happen to be of all the same type, which means that a new match is made automatically, and the player scores again. The odds of such a result are low (around 2 percent for getting three of the same colors in a row), but they are still high enough that a player will see it many times with enough games played. Of course, the AI is playing the same game, so the player will see this lucky match fall into the enemy’s lap as well. At this point, human psychology takes over. Because the new pieces are hidden from view, how does the player know that the computer is not conducting some funny business and giving itself some free matches? The human mind is notoriously bad at grasping probability, so many players are convinced that the AI is cheating. The developers have pledged over and over again that everything is fair and even, but whether they like it or not, the player experience has been affected by the simply possibility of cheating. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923421999

This means policies that govern the crisis management process are tightly integrated with the implementation, which makes it hard to adapt the system to changing requirements. Modern systems are expected to be adaptable and need to evolve along with the availability of new information sources and changing business processes. Previous work suggested using workflow systems to manage crisis management processes. Current approaches that use workflow systems are not end-user friendly or not flexible enough. In this paper we present our approach that combines workflows and decision tables for creating more flexible decision support systems. While workflows are used to orchestrate services and implement information logistics in the decision support processes, embedded rule sets are used to provide flexibility and adaptability of workflows. The rule sets are authored using decision tables which are an easy-to-use representation that allows end-users to express rules in an intuitive way. © 2012 ISCRAM.","Decision support; Decision tables; Flexibility; Rules; Usability; Workflows","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Information systems; Decision supports; Flexibility; Rules; Usability; Work-flows; Decision tables",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905595419

In particular, if a condition is mentioned in a regulation, an activity that makes that condition true, or that requires it as a precondition, should be annotated accordingly. In our approach, annotations are defined by specifying the effects of atomic tasks, including the obligations they generate, using Artificial Intelligence techniques for reasoning about actions and the notion of commitment developed in the context of a social approach to agent communication. Verifying the compliance of a business process to a regulation includes checking that, in all executions of the business process, all the obligations triggered by the norms are fulfilled.

Exchange protocols, for instance, coordinate delivery of new values to the participants, i.e. additions to the set of values they possess. An exchange protocol is fair if it ensures that delivery of new values is balanced: If one participant obtains a new possession via the protocol, then all other participants will, too. Understanding this balanced coordination of different principals in a distributed system re'uires relating (long-term) state to (short-term) protocol activities. Fair exchange also re'uires progress assumptions. In this paper we adapt the strand space framework to protocols, such as fair exchange, that coordinate state changes. We regard the state as a multiset of facts, and we allow protocol actions to cause local changes in this state via multiset rewriting. Second, progress assumptions stipulate that some channels are resilient-and guaranteed to deliver messages-and some principals will not stop at critical steps. Our proofs of correctness cleanly separate protocol properties, such as authentication and confidentiality, from properties about progress and state evolution. G. Wang's recent fair exchange protocol illustrates the approach. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.","Cryptographic protocol analysis; Fair exchange; Strand spaces; Verification","Automata theory; Software engineering; Verification; Cryptographic protocols; Distributed systems; Exchange protocols; Fair exchange; Fair-exchange protocols; Multiset rewriting; State evolutions; Strand space; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893028963

These algorithms have been successfully used to solve problems in different disciplines such as engineering, business, science, and networking etc. Real world optimization problems are divided into two categories: (1) single objective, and (2) multi-objective. Genetic algorithms have key advantages over other optimization techniques to deal with multi-objective optimization problems. One of the most popular techniques of GA to obtain the Pareto-optimal set of solutions for multi-objective problems is the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm- II (NSGA-II). In this paper, we propose a variant of NSGA-II that we call the comprehensive parent selection-based genetic algorithm (CPSGA). The proposed strategy uses the information of all the individuals to generate new offspring from the selected parents. This strategy ensures diversity to discourage premature convergence. CPSGA is tested using the standard ZDT benchmark problems and the performance metrics taken from the literature. Moreover, the results produced are compared with the original NSGA-II algorithm. The results show that the proposed approach is a viable alternative to solve multi-objective optimization problems. © Springer-Verlag London 2012.",,"Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Multi-objective optimization problem; Multi-objective problem; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Optimization techniques; Pareto-optimal sets; Performance metrics; Pre-mature convergences; Real-world optimization; Genetic algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881490767

The prediction is based on the data extracted from a combination of historical (closed) and/or live (open) workflows (jobs or process instances). In real-world applications, the problem is compounded by the fact that the number of unique workflows (process prototypes) can be enormous, their occurrences can be limited, and a real process may deviate from the designed process when executed in real environment and under realistic constraints. It is necessary for an efficient predictor to be able to cope with the diverse characteristics of the data.We also have to ensure that useful process data is collected to build the appropriate predictive model.

A police organization is examined as a case study, and its Business Intelligence (BI) system and users and their interaction in solving daily tasks are observed. The study took place during two different time periods in 2009 and 2011. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used, including a survey and interviews. Two main user groups were identified in the police organization: viewers and analysts. The results of this study showed that in the context of viewers BI is in connection view and is slowly emerging into immersion. On the other hand, in the context of analysts BI is positioned in immersion view and, based on emergent properties, we concluded that there is potential for a slow emergence towards fusion once more capabilities are integrated in the BI system used by the analysts. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.","Business Intelligence; connection view; emergence; fusion view; immersion view","Artificial intelligence; Competitive intelligence; Information analysis; Law enforcement; Business intelligence systems; connection view; emergence; Emergent property; immersion view; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Through the lens; Time-periods; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879238507

Such a business model has recently received significant attention from researchers in economics and computer science, mostly due to its successful application in online businesses, such as Groupon5. This paper deals with the market situation when multiple sellers sell a product to a number of buyers with discount for group buying. We model this problem as a multi-unit double auction. We first examine two deterministic mechanisms that are budget balanced, individually rational and only onesided truthful, i.e. it is truthful for either buyers or sellers. Then we find that, although there exists a ""trivial"" (non-deterministic) mechanism that is (weakly) budget balanced, individually rational and truthful for both buyers and sellers, such a mechanism is not achievable if we further require that both the trading size and the payment are neither seller-independent nor buyer-independent. In addition, we show that there is no budget balanced, individually rational and truthful mechanism that can also guarantee a reasonable trading size. © 2012 The Author(s).",,"Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Commerce; Business modeling; Buyers and sellers; Deterministic mechanism; Discounted price; Double auction; Market situation; Online business; Truthful mechanisms; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878777183

Inc., United States","Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been successfully applied in the petroleum industry since the early 1990s initially attempting to solve simple tasks and more recently evolving into hybrid systems taking on complex optimization and modeling problems. Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of our business in the last 10 years with applications ranging from reservoir characterization, production optimization to surrogate models used in reservoir simulation. Chevron's San Joaquin Valley Business Unit has been implementing AI technologies through Chevron's i-field™ program since 2003. With the majority of the production coming from heavy oil assets, most of the intelligent applications developed using AI target the optimization of thermal operations. The paper describes the operator's experience and continuing efforts towards integration of Artificial Intelligence technologies in the Business Unit. The manuscript covers two topics: a review of several successful Artificial Intelligence applications implemented in the heavy oil assets while focusing on solutions and value creation, and an internal training program aimed at developing the company's organizational capability in this domain. The first part discusses the successful implementation of AI techniques, neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, case-based reasoning and hybrid systems to solve complex projects. Case studies covering well candidate selection, optimization of cyclic steam scheduling, increased production opportunities identification, well failure diagnostic and job planning are presented. The review concludes with lessons learned, challenges and business value creation (increased production, NPV, time savings, etc). The second part highlights the efforts of initiating and implementing a training program aimed at building awareness and organizational capability. In 2009, a few AI enthusiasts and practitioners formed an Interest Group with the mission of enhancing reservoir management workflows by developing innovative solutions using Data Mining and AI technologies. The section describes the target audience, training material, workshops structure, brainstorming exercises and lessons learned from the sessions completed so far. Ultimately, the review is intended to demonstrate the value of applying AI, and how to grow AI organizational capability. A brief overview of future plans concludes the paper.

We deployed the system in one of the largest hospitals in China and its affiliated community centers in order to manage type 2 diabetic patients. Pilot use of GC3 demonstrates its benefits to regional chronic care including evidence-based decision support, shared care content, improved clinician adherence to guidelines and enhanced patient self-management.

It then uses machine learning algorithms to produce statistical results and aggregators, weighted predictions, and appropriate recommendations. Designed as a stand-alone structure, Evicase can be used for a range of decision support applications including guideline adherence monitoring and personalized prognostic predictions. © 2012 European Federation for Medical Informatics and IOS Press.

This paper aims to propose a novel method for assigning proper staff to specific task in such activities. Business object and process models are established, while two key problems, namely skill requirement analysis for MRO service tasks and assigning service staff, are pointed out. To present MRO service skills and properties of level, skill vector is stated and used to analyse skill requirements of tasks. A three-phase approach to assign service staff is put forward, applying an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) and specific evaluation pattern to intelligently search and rank the feasible groups of service staff. Finally, a decision support system that is implemented to validate the approach proposed ahead is introduced.

The advantages of PDE based approaches are that they can be made fully automatic, robust for the analysis of images, videos and high dimensional data. A fundamental question is whether one can use PDEs to perform all the basic tasks in the image processing. If one can devise PDEs to perform full-scale mode decomposition for signals and images, the modes thus generated would be very useful for secondary processing to meet the needs in various types of signal and image processing. Despite of great progress in PDE based image analysis in the past two decades, the basic roles of PDEs in image/signal analysis are only limited to PDE based low-pass filters, and their applications to noise removal, edge detection, segmentation, etc. At present, it is not clear how to construct PDE based methods for full-scale mode decomposition. The above-mentioned limitation of most current PDE based image/signal processing methods is addressed in the proposed work, in which we introduce a family of mode decomposition evolution equations (MoDEEs) for a vast variety of applications. The MoDEEs are constructed as an extension of a PDE based high-pass filter (Wei and Jia in Europhys. Lett. 59(6):814-819, 2002) by using arbitrarily high order PDE based low-pass filters introduced by Wei (IEEE Signal Process. Lett. 6(7):165-167, 1999). The use of arbitrarily high order PDEs is essential to the frequency localization in the mode decomposition. Similar to the wavelet transform, the present MoDEEs have a controllable time-frequency localization and allow a perfect reconstruction of the original function. Therefore, the MoDEE operation is also called a PDE transform. However, modes generated from the present approach are in the spatial or time domain and can be easily used for secondary processing. Various simplifications of the proposed MoDEEs, including a linearized version, and an algebraic version, are discussed for computational convenience. The Fourier pseudospectral method, which is unconditionally stable for linearized high order MoDEEs, is utilized in our computation. Validation is carried out to mode separation of high frequency adjacent modes. Applications are considered to signal and image denoising, image edge detection, feature extraction, enhancement etc. It is hoped that this work enhances the understanding of high order PDEs and yields robust and useful tools for image and signal analysis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Anisotropic diffusion; Evolution equations; High order PDE transform; High-pass filter; Mode decomposition; Partial differential equation; Total variation","Clustering algorithms; Computer vision; Edge detection; Feature extraction; High pass filters; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Linearization; Low pass filters; Partial differential equations; Processing; Time domain analysis; Wavelet transforms; Anisotropic Diffusion; Evolution equations; Mode decomposition; Pde transforms; Total variation; Image denoising",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872395367

Each of these phases involves information exchange between different agencies involved in planning and running the event. It has been widely recognized that the data quality and access to critical information impact on the efficiency of the response and overall effectiveness of the emergency management. Therefore, there is a need for solid understanding of the information needs of the agencies pertinent to designing efficient decision support systems, which are truly integrated into the context of business environment and facilitate IT-enabled work of the personnel organizing and running mass gathering events. Introduction of such ubiquitous systems depends on availability of ontology of the problem domain, which provides a common ground for information integration, gathering and exchange. We propose a conceptual architecture for ontology-based, IT-enabled decision support that extends to all phases of mass gatherings. As an example, we describe a case-based reasoning (CBR) system which takes advantage of such an ontology and ontology reasoning and can be used for prediction of medical workload and providing better understanding of mass gathering events during planning or training of new staff. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.","decision making; mass gatherings; medical emergency management; ontologies; ontology reasoning; Ubiquitous decision support systems","Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Civil defense; Decision support systems; Disasters; Ontology; Personnel training; Risk management; Case based reasoning systems; Comprehensive managements; Conceptual architecture; Information integration; mass gatherings; Medical emergency; Ontology reasonings; Ubiquitous decision support systems; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871721020

Purpose of the system is to prolong the autonomous living of the elderly at home. When the system identifies a health problem, it automatically notifies a physician and provides an explanation of the automatic diagnosis. The gait of the elderly user is captured using a motion-capture system, which consists of body-worn tags and wall-mounted sensors. The positions of the tags are acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine-learning algorithms in order to recognize a specific health problem. Novel semantic features based on medical knowledge for training a machine-learning classifier are proposed in this paper. The classifier classifies the user's gait into: 1) normal, 2) with hemiplegia, 3) with Parkinson's disease, 4) with pain in the back and 5) with pain in the leg. The studies of 1) the feasibility of automatic recognition and 2) the impact of tag placement and noise level on the accuracy of the recognition of health problems are presented. The experimental results of the first study (12 tags, no noise) showed that the k-nearest neighbors and neural network algorithms achieved classification accuracies of 100%. The experimental results of the second study showed that classification accuracy of over 99% is achievable using several machine-learning algorithms and 8 or more tags with up to 15 mm standard deviation of noise. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy and can be used as a guide for further studies in the increasingly important area of Ambient Assisted Living. Since the system uses semantic features and an artificial-intelligence approach to interpret the health state, provides a natural explanation of the hypothesis and is embedded in the domestic environment of the elderly person; it is an example of the semantic ambient media for Ambient Assisted Living. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ambient assisted living; Ambient intelligence; Ambient media; Data mining; Elderly care; Gait analysis; Health-problems detection; Human locomotion; Human-motion analysis; Machine learning; Pervasive health; Temporal data mining; Time-series data mining; Ubiquitous computing","Data mining; Diagnosis; Gait analysis; Health; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical problems; Semantics; Sensors; Time series analysis; Ubiquitous computing; Walking aids; Ambient assisted living; Ambient intelligence; Ambient media; Elderly care; Human locomotions; Human-motion analysis; Pervasive healths; Temporal data mining; Time-series data; Pattern recognition",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867425521

However, the interpretation of medical images is still almost always performed by radiologists. Developments in artificial intelligence and image processing have shown the increasingly great potential of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Nevertheless, it has remained challenging to develop a general approach to process various commonly used types of medical images (e.g.; X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound images). To facilitate diagnosis, we recommend the use of image segmentation to discover regions of interest (ROI) using self-organizing maps (SOM). We devise a two-stage SOM approach that can be used to precisely identify the dominant colors of a medical image and then segment it into several small regions. In addition, by appropriately conducting the recursive merging steps to merge smaller regions into larger ones, radiologists can usually identify one or more ROIs within a medical image. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Computer-aided diagnosis; Image segmentation; Region of interest; Self-organizing map","algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; bone; brain; cerebellum; color; comparative study; controlled study; cyst; diagnostic imaging; echography; human; image analysis; image processing; liver; lung lobe; meninx; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiography; radiologist; self organizing map; computer assisted diagnosis; methodology; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Radiography; Ultrasonography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867314255

Heating plants provide energy in the form of hot water for heating houses and apartments in local municipalities. Forest fuel are products obtained from harvesting in forests that cannot be used for further processing at sawmills and pulp and paper mills. Examples of such products are tree branches, tree tops and low quality logs. The optimization of the supply chain for round-wood (logs to sawmills, pulp and paper mills) and for forest fuel is similar but involves two main differences. First, forest fuel has to be converted into chips before delivery to the customer, and second, the demand for forest fuel varies over the year due to the temperature. To balance the chipping and transportation capacities over time, it is important to manage inventory levels at terminals. The optimization model developed provides decision support for questions regarding the choice of technology for chipping, where to perform the chipping operations, and the allocation of different assortments to heating plants. The system has been tested on a large case study from a Swedish forest energy company. The results show large savings and that the system is very useful for both planning and business development. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of several management interfaces for Eucalyptus cloud by addressing the taxonomy and evaluation of the cloud management interfaces. The taxonomy proposed in this paper results from the work accomplished by experimenting the Eucalyptus community cloud. First, an evaluation of the Eucalyptus architecture is presented, in order to emphasize the Eucalyptus platform involved in cloud management process, which facilitates the deployment, management and execution of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). The cloud management tools are described from two perspectives. The first perspective analyzes the cloud portals from the user roles, while the second perspective addresses them with respect to the type of the tools employed. The taxonomy presented in this paper is related with the 5 elements of the Common Cloud Management Architecture (CCMA), which was provided by Behrendt, et al. (2011) as one of the components of IBM Cloud Computing Reference Architecture. Thus, the first category of interfaces (i.e. the cloud portals from the user roles) encompasses the Service Consumer Portal, the Service Provider Portal and the Service Development Portal, while second category of interfaces includes the main components of CCMA: Operational Support Services (OSS) and Business Support Services (BSS). Cloud management is a subject approached by researchers in the community and this can be observed by the big number of third party cloud management providers (i.e. RightScale, enStratus, IMOD Kaavo, CloudWatch, Scarl, Tapin, Cloudkick). This article is motivated by the fact that cloud management is a fundamental support for all users of cloud services from the cloud marketplace. ©2012 IEEE.","Cloud API; Cloud management; euca2ools; Eucalyptus community cloud; Graphical user interfaces; Instances management; Key management; Third party cloud management tools; User/groups management; Volumes management","Application programming interfaces (API); Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Graphical user interfaces; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Taxonomies; Business support services; Cloud managements; Community clouds; Continuous development; euca2ools; Key management; Operational support services; Reference architecture; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866776235

As a result, the creation of new transnational corporations has increased. Any corporation of this magnitude requires a very complex staff hierarchy to properly function. As a result, typical problems in bureaucracy management have developed that usually occurred in highly developed economies. These problems have been researched at a theoretical level for a very long time. Certain results have been obtained by using enterprise resource planning systems that ensure transparency in any point of the process where the document processing flows. There are moments when a tight control must be exercised as in reducing personnel schema. This must be done without decreasing the organizational efficiency. Anyway, it is very hard to control a structure when one also uses a part of it to generate the executive reports necessary. In this paper a solution that may help to increase the control over bureaucracy is presented. The solution is used to generate software based on agents in order to find and extract the real organization structure by doing automatic analysis of all document workflows. Probably the most important advantage of the solution is that it is not under the control of the audited structure and consequently the results will not be modified because the lower staff will always try to protect themselves. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","artificial intelligence; business process re-engineering; distributed computing","Artificial intelligence; Distributed computer systems; Enterprise resource planning; Industry; Silicate minerals; Software agents; Automatic analysis; Automatic extraction; Business process re-engineering; Developed economies; Document-processing; Enterprise resource planning systems; Organization structures; Organizational efficiency; Software-based; Transnational corporations; Work-flows; Intelligent systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866401896

This approach has two major pitfalls: first, it does not consider a dynamic scenario, in which suppliers and their ratings are constantly changing; second, it only addressed the problem from the point of view of a single business, and cannot be easily applied when considering more than one business. To overcome these problems, we introduce a method for supplier selection that builds upon the dynamic MCDM framework of [1] and, by means of a linear programming model, can be used in the case of multiple collaborating businesses planning their next batch of orders together. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Decision support systems; Dynamic decision making; Linear programming models; Multiple criteria decision making; Supplier selection; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865983305

While most of the attention of the research community is focused on considering the perspective of the Cloud providers, offering mechanisms to support scaling of resources and interoperability and federation between Clouds, the perspective of developers and operators willing to choose the Cloud without being strictly bound to a specific solution is mostly neglected. We argue that Model-Driven Development can be helpful in this context as it would allow developers to design software systems in a cloud-agnostic way and to be supported by model transformation techniques into the process of instantiating the system into specific, possibly, multiple Clouds. The MODAClouds (MOdel-Driven Approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple Clouds) approach we present here is based on these principles and aims at supporting system developers and operators in exploiting multiple Clouds for the same system and in migrating (part of) their systems from Cloud to Cloud as needed. MODAClouds offers a quality-driven design, development and operation method and features a Decision Support System to enable risk analysis for the selection of Cloud providers and for the evaluation of the Cloud adoption impact on internal business processes. Furthermore, MODAClouds offers a run-time environment for observing the system under execution and for enabling a feedback loop with the design environment. This allows system developers to react to performance fluctuations and to re-deploy applications on different Clouds on the long term. © 2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; model-driven development; performance; portability","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Computer software portability; Decision support systems; Quality control; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Software engineering; Design environment; Development and operations; Model driven approach; Model driven development; Model transformation technique; performance; Research communities; Runtime environments; Embedded systems",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864997201

They contain medical knowledge, usually about a very specifically defined task, and are able to reason with data from individual patients to come up with reasoned conclusion. Although there are many variations, the knowledge within an expert system is typically represented in the form of a set of rules. Arthritis is a chronic disease and about three fourth of the patients are suffering from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis which are undiagnosed and the delay of detection may cause the severity of the disease at higher risk. Thus, earlier detection of arthritis and treatment of its type of arthritis and related locomotry abnormalities is of vital importance. Thus the work was aimed to design a system for the diagnosis of Arthitis using fuzzy logic controller (FLC) which is, a successful application of Zadeh's fuzzy set theory. It is a potential tool for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision. Thus, the knowledge of a doctor can be modelled using an FLC. The performance of an FLC depends on its knowledge base which consists of a data base and a rule base. It is observed that the performance of an FLC mainly depends on its rule base, and optimizing the membership function distributions stored in the data base is a fine tuning process. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.","Arthritis; Fuzzy inference system; Linguistic variable; Osteoarthritis; Rheumatoid arthritis","arthritis; article; computer model; data base; fuzzy system; information processing device; knowledge base; professional knowledge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864073880

Most staff functions are carried out using standard means of text communication. Exactly how members of staff perform their duties, who they communicate with and how, and how they could perform better, is an area of active research. In command and control research, there is not yet a single model which explains all actions undertaken by members of staff well enough to prescribe a set of procedures for how to perform functions in command and control. In this context, we have studied whether automated classification approaches can be applied to textual communication to assist researchers who study command teams and analyze their actions. Specifically, we report the results from evaluating machine leaning with respect to two metrics of classification performance: (1) the precision of finding a known transition between two activities in a work process, and (2) the precision of classifying messages similarly to human researchers that search for critical episodes in a workflow. The results indicate that classification based on text only provides higher precision results with respect to both metrics when compared to other machine learning approaches, and that the precision of classifying messages using text-based classification in already classified datasets was approximately 50%. We present the implications that these results have for the design of support systems based on machine learning, and outline how to practically use text classification for analyzing team communications by demonstrating a specific prototype support tool for workflow analysis. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Classification; Command and control; Exploratory sequential data analysis; Random indexing; Text clustering; Workflow mining","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Function evaluation; Learning systems; Military applications; Text processing; Command and control; Random indexing; Sequential data analysis; Text Clustering; Workflow mining; Command and control systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862228928

We integrate the algorithm selection ([1]) and probabilistic graphs to transform the algorithm selection model of offline algorithms for a dynamically adaptive model of online trading. Unlike the traditional static approach of algorithm selection, where a single algorithm is executed over the whole investment horizon, we dynamically select and update the trading algorithm by analyzing the time series features. The time series is partitioned in different windows and each window's features are extracted sequentially using real time hybrid pattern matching approach. The extracted features of current window w i are analyzed and the decision making module determines the best suitable algorithm for next window wi+1 on the basis of underlying probabilistic graphical model.

Although it can be efficiently used for modeling workflow structures, it is not suitable for modeling the low-level logic of particular tasks in the process. Recently, Business Rules have been used for this purpose. Such rules are often specified in natural language and in an informal way. In this paper, we consider an approach to the integration of Business Processes with Business Rules. As a proof of concept, we propose a framework based on the Oryx BPMN editor integrated with rule-based tools. The goal of the integration of the BPMN editor with the XTT2 rule framework is to provide an environment for visual modeling processes with formally described business rules. We also discuss execution options of the integrated model. In the future, this opens up a possibility to execute such models using the HeaRT rule engine. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Computation theory; Soft computing; Business Process; Business rules; Integrated modeling; Natural languages; Proof of concept; Visual model; Visual notations; Workflow structures; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861015535

In contrast to other works about belief revision, here the constraints are assumed to be fixed. The method has two variants, dual of each other, whose revised degrees of belief are respectively above and below the original ones. The upper [resp. lower] revised degrees of belief are uniquely characterized as the lowest [resp. greatest] ones that are invariant by a certain max-min [resp. min-max] operation determined by the logical constraints. In both variants, making balance between the revised degree of belief of a proposition and that of its negation leads to decisions that are ensured to be consistent with the logical constraints. These decisions are ensured to agree with the majority criterion as applied to the original degrees of belief whenever this gives a consistent result. They are also ensured to satisfy a property of respect for unanimity about any particular issue, as well as a property of monotonicity with respect to the original degrees of belief. The application of the method to certain special domains comes down to well established or increasingly accepted methods, such as the single-link method of cluster analysis and the method of paths in preferential voting. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Belief revision; Cluster analysis; Conjunctive normal forms; Constrained judgment aggregation; Decision theory; Degrees of belief; Doctrinal paradox; Plausible reasoning; Preferential voting",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860665812

We detect and describe keypoints on the image mesh using an analogue of the SIFT algorithm for images with two key modifications: the process is made insensitive to viewpoint and structural discontinuities using a novel bilinear filter, and a physical scale space is constructed that exploits the reliable range measurements. Keypoints are matched between scans only when their physical scales agree, avoiding many potential false matches. Finally, the matches are rank-ordered using a new quality measure and supplied to a registration algorithm that refines each match into a rigid transformation for the entire scan pair. We report experimental results on keypoint detection and matching and range scan registration and verification in a set of difficult real-world scan pairs, showing that the new physical scale keypoints are demonstrably better than a competing approach based on backprojected SIFT keypoints. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bilateral filter; Range data; Range registration; Range/intensity images; SIFT","Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Bilateral filters; Range data; Range registration; Range/intensity images; SIFT; Mesh generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859266548

The successful use of these systems involves a combination of human ability and computer support. An implicit assumption underlying their use is that the business problems for which they are deployed have been carefully defined by the stakeholders prior to their use. This includes, in particular, understanding of the problem variables and their possible impact on the decision outcomes and knowing which information is necessary for supporting it. However, this assumption might not hold in the modern business environment. This is due to the increasing complexity and rate of change of the environment, the geographical and temporal dispersion of modern organizations, and the diversity and quantity of information sources that is available. In this paper we propose the idea of extending the scope of these systems to include a step preceding the solution process: problem framing. We claim that new technologies such as Web 2.0 provide novel opportunities to add this facility to DSS and NSS. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach combining domain and task ontologies. The task ontology we propose employs concepts from soft systems methodology. Specifically, we suggest that a stakeholder can use the ontologies to understand the problem, frame the issue, and identify the information required for the task. The ontologies can support accessing the information sources when the system is being used by stakeholders. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Business environments; Business problems; Decision support system (dss); Information sources; Negotiation support system; Problem structuring; Soft systems methodology; Temporal dispersion; Ontology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857958258

We also argue that good results can be achieved by training task classifiers offline on user context data gathered in laboratory settings. Finally, we isolate a combination of contextual features that present a significantly better discriminative power than classical ones. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"Contextual feature; Evaluation results; Information Extraction; Knowledge-intensive business; Offline; Ontology-based; Rule based; Task detection; User context; User interaction; User study; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856895091

Evolution theory is all about long-term adaptation, psychology is (among other things) interested in how people cope mentally with various changes in their life, business research tries to find ways to make companies survive and flourish in the ever more turbulent markets, armies rethink their strategies and become more flexible to be able to counter new threats, engineering disciplines move towards making systems better at reconfiguring and repairing themselves without costly and time-consuming human intervention, achieving sophisticated artificial life and artificial intelligence is in large part about finding out how to create systems that are highly adaptive and cope with the difficult and often unexpected situations they encounter, and so forth. When trying to understand, manage or create large complex systems, the issue of adaptivity almost always arises to the set of top concerns, even so much so that it has become quite common to use the term Complex Adaptive Systems when referring to the subject of research, management and design efforts in various fields that deal with systems consisting of large numbers of interacting components. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Adaptivity; Artificial Life; Business research; Complex adaptive systems; Design effort; Engineering disciplines; Evolution theory; Human intervention; Large parts; Adaptive systems; Artificial intelligence; Research; Cost engineering",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856887318

In the control scheme proposed here, the system has to be first represented through a multi-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy-based model approach to make an appropriate prediction of the system behavior. Subsequently, a multi-generalized predictive control (GPC) scheme, which is organized based on a number of GPC schemes, is realized in line with the investigated model outcomes, at chosen operating points of the system. In case of the proposed control strategy realization, the investigated multi-GPC scheme is instantly updated to handle the system by activating the best control scheme through a new GPC identifier, while the system output is suddenly varied with respect to time. To present the applicability of the proposed control scheme, an industrial tubular heat exchanger system and also a drum-type boiler-turbine system have been chosen to drive through the proposed strategy. In such a case, the simulations are carried out and the corresponding results are compared with those obtained using traditional GPC scheme in addition to nonlinear GPC (NLGPC) scheme, as benchmark approaches, where the acquired results of the proposed control scheme are desirably verified. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Drum-type boiler-turbine system; GPC identifier; GPC scheme; Industrial tubular heat exchanger system; Linear model approximation; Multi-GPC scheme; Multi-TSK fuzzy-based model approach; NLGPC scheme; System operating points","Boiler turbine system; Fuzzy-based models; GPC identifier; GPC scheme; Linear model approximation; Multi-GPC scheme; NLGPC scheme; Operating points; Tubular heat exchangers; Artificial intelligence; Boiler control; Boilers; Heat exchangers; Mathematical models; Model predictive control; Turbine rings; Predictive control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856249356

In particular, it describes a method that allows decision-making (selecting the adaptation to perform) in situations where third-party pluggable multimedia conversion modules are involved and the multimedia adaptation planner does not know their exact adaptation capabilities. In this approach, the multimedia adaptation planner module is only responsible for a part of the required decisions; the pluggable modules make additional decisions based on different criteria. We demonstrate that partial decision-making is not only attainable, but also introduces advantages with respect to a system in which these conversion modules are not capable of providing additional decisions. This means that transferring decisions from the multi-step multimedia adaptation planner to the pluggable conversion modules increases the flexibility of the adaptation. Moreover, by allowing conversion modules to be only partially described, the range of problems that these modules can address increases, while significantly decreasing both the description length of the adaptation capabilities and the planning decision time. Finally, we specify the conditions under which knowing the partial adaptation capabilities of a set of conversion modules will be enough to compute a proper adaptation plan. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bounded non-deterministic multimedia adaptation; Decision-making; MPEG-21; MPEG-7; Planning","Artificial intelligence planning; Decision time; MPEG-21; MPEG-7; Multi-step; Multimedia adaptation; Multimedia content adaptation; Pluggable modules; Artificial intelligence; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Planning; Decision making",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856237157

This is challenging because of the very large appearance variation in the images, as well as the potential mismatch between images and their captions. For both tasks, we compare generative and discriminative probabilistic models, as well as methods that maximize subgraph densities in similarity graphs. We extend them by considering different metric learning techniques to obtain appropriate face representations that reduce intra person variability and increase inter person separation.

Database system was developed which led to the evolvement of hierarchical and relational database followed by Standard Query Language (SQL). As data size increases, the need for more control and information retrieval increase. These increases lead to the development of data mining systems and data warehouses. This paper focuses on the use of data warehouse as a supporting tool in decision making. We to study the effectiveness of data warehouse techniques in the sense of time and flexibility in our case study (Manpower Employment). The study will conclude with a comparison of traditional relational database and the use of data warehouse. The fundamental role of data warehouse is to provide data for supporting decision-making process. Data in data warehouse environment is multidimensional data store. We can simply say that data warehouse is a process not a product, for assembling and managing data from various sources for the purpose of gaining a single detailed view of part or all an establishment. The data warehouse concept has changed the nature of decision support system, by adding new benefits for improving and expanding the scope, accuracy, and accessibility of data. The warehouse is the link between the application and raw data, which is scattered in separate database but now is unified. The objectives of this work are to study the impact of using data warehouse on Manpower Employment Decision Support System, in the sense as far as the data quality concern. We will focus on the benefits gained from using data warehouse, and why it is more powerful than the use of traditional databases in decision making.

This ecosystem is the home for different species. Due to various socio-economical and ecological criteria, Urmia Lake has important role in the Northwestern part of the country but it has faced many problems in recent years. Because of droughts, overuse of surface water resources and dam constructions, water level has decreased in such a way that one quarter of the lake has changed to saline area in the last 10 years. The purpose of this research is to determine the main factors which reduce the lake's water level. To this end, a simulation model, based on system dynamics method, is developed for the Urmia Lake basin to estimate the lake's level. After successful verification of the model, results show that (among the proposed factors) changes in inflows due to the climate change and overuse of surface water resources is the main factor for 65% of the effect, constructing four dams is responsible for 25% of the problem, and less precipitation on lake has 10% effect on decreasing the lake's level in the recent years.

An important limitation is that the data are usually displayed as point estimates without full description of the instability of the underlying data, thus decision makers are often unaware of the presence of outliers or data errors. To manage this problem, we propose an Information Volatility Measure (IVM) to complement business intelligence (BI) tools when considering aggregated data (intra-cell) or when observing trends in data (inter-cell). The IVM definitions and calculations are drawn from volatility measures found in the field of finance, since the underlying data in both arenas display similar behaviors. The presentation of the IVM is supplemented with three types of benchmarking to support improved user understanding of the measure: numerical benchmarking, graphical benchmarking, and categorical benchmarking. The IVM is designed and evaluated using exploratory and confirmatory focus groups. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have focused mainly on contractor prequalification from the owner's or consultant's perspective. There remains a need for a model to evaluate the contractor and project-specific aspects (i.e., project team and contractual risks) from the surety bonding perspective. This paper identifies and classifies the most relevant evaluation criteria that surety underwriters and brokers consider when evaluating a specific construction project for bonding purposes. Several data collection techniques (questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, and interacting group meetings), with highly experienced surety experts, were conducted to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of the evaluation criteria. Both fuzzy logic and expert systems are combined to develop a decision support system (DSS) for use in contractor and project evaluation. An approach for fuzzy membership function estimation is presented using a traditional membership function estimation technique, integrated with data of contractor prequalification cases. Thirty-eight alternative system configurations are investigated to determine the most accurate one. The system is validated using 32 prequalification cases, and the accuracy of the system is found to be 84.0%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
