As everything is powered by AI in the current time, it has altered our way of living. The widespread adoption of AI across businesses and corporations is helping them in streamlining their processes, increasing productivity, boosting efficiency, and reducing costs. The integration of artificial intelligence with human resource management (HRM) practices is changing the way organizations appoint, manage, and engage their workforce. Artificial intelligence is enabling machines to make decisions more accurately than humans based on existing data sets and behavioural patterns. This transformation has caused machines to take over all the manual work thus leading HR professionals to take up more strategic roles. It is paramount for companies and professionals to understand how this technology works and its role in various HRM functions. This paper reviews the work of many eminent researchers to find out ways in which AI is bringing a change in the field of human resource management. This review highlights the key benefits and hidden challenges of AI when applied to HRM and also illustrate its future potential. © 2020 IEEE.","AI; Artificial Intelligence; human resource management; machine learning","Human resource management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Artificial intelligence technologies; Boosting efficiency; Reducing costs; Strategic role; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104654249

Therefore, it is necessary to use an online proofreading system to make up for the lack of English translation software. However, due to the traditional online proofreading system, the design of the translation logic is relatively fragmented, resulting in the constant changes in the proofreading node layout and affecting the proofreading results. Therefore, an online proofreading system for business English translation based on machine vision is designed. In terms of hardware, connect a new type of single-chip microcomputer in the system and redesign the control circuit. On the software side, it calculates vocabulary similarity by tracking business English vocabulary; calculating semantic similarity based on content characteristics, and designing the system's online proofreading logic based on machine vision theory, and then resetting the system's online intelligent proofreading method. Experimental results: Compared with the system under the traditional design, the proofreading node of the design system deployment and control has a certain regularity.

Most of the existing researches mainly focus on taking the internal structural features of the enterprise as the starting point to study the influencing factors of enterprise marketing trends. Different with previous studies, This research attempts to simulate the analyzing and decision processes of domain experts towards issues of enterprise operations by using artificial intelligent. One main challenge of the research is to simulate domain experts' behaviors of analyzing multi-data including both structured and unstructured data, especially how to extract knowledge, patterns and import factors from unstructured data to support enterprise decisions. In order to solve the challenge mentioned above, an intelligent analysis framework MS-LSTM based on business management theory is proposed. Firstly, MS-LSTM collects, processes and analyzes multi-data by using an encoder strategy module, which contains more than 10 strategy models such as normalization, one-hot, distribution fitting, time series completion, semantic encoding, Bert, etc., providing high quality input for downstream tasks. Finally, a LSTM based time series processing model is proposed to make marketing prediction based on upstream processed multi-source data. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the proposed model. Compared with traditional benchmark model, the proposed MS-LSTM could efficiently extract meaningful knowledge and patterns, which could be explained to a certain extent by business management theory, from multi-source data. The model has improved the accuracy of enterprise trend prediction by 19.3 times compared with state-of-art baselines, which further verify the application values of the research. © 2020 ACM.","Bert; Business Intelligence; Deep Learning; LSTM; MS-LSTM; Trend Forecast","Commerce; Computation theory; Data flow analysis; Data fusion; Data mining; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Marketing; Planning; Semantics; Signal encoding; Time series; Artificial intelligent; Business management; Decision process; Distribution fitting; Intelligent analysis; Structural feature; Time series processing; Unstructured data; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102975822

The process of detecting weak signals is very challenging, and many techniques were proposed to automatize this challenge but still needs the intervention of experts' opinion. Understanding those detected signals and their evolution in time is crucial to reveal the alertness of possible future events and warnings. For this reason, this paper proposes a new algorithm to strengthen weak signals into early warning signs. The proposed algorithm aims to monitor and track weak signals' evolution within time. The output will be a list of early warning signs and visualization to illustrate their evolution in time. Finally, to adequately understand the early warning signs obtained and enhance their semantic alertness, we used Word2Vec modeling to provide semantically similar words to these warning signs and improve their contextual alertness. We tested this algorithm on a web news dataset of 2006-2007 to detect early warning signs related to the 2008 financial crisis ahead of time. We obtained prominent results in strengthening and monitoring the evolution of early warning signs related to this crisis. © 2020 ACM.","Early Warning Signs; Futures knowledge; Weak Signals Evolution","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Semantics; Business competition; Early warning signs; Financial crisis; Possible futures; Warning signs; Weak signals; Signal detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102970850

In the same way, relations with the outside environment improve: customers and suppliers. The birth of the Internet and later of social networks led to public ideas, debates and opinions; which constitute an interesting source to detect opinion trends among users. This complex data analysis is carried out by different disciplines of artificial intelligence with the implementation of algorithms. One of those disciplines is the Analysis of Feelings, which through an opinion, emotion or attitude that is mainly inferred from a text, analyzes and classifies them.

The inception of these technologies along with deep learning approaches has transformed the business environment completely, especially customer relationship management. Additionally, augmented reality has changed the business production environment with interactive designs and machines learning approaches. Augmented reality is expected to grow by $814.7B in 2025 which will bring a huge transformation in the businesses. Though leveraging technologies have been introduced to transform customer experience, with an ever-accelerating tidal wave of advancing technology, the adoption rate of these technologies in business is not satisfactory. This is because of unawareness of the experience transformation rate of augmented reality on business. Many applications related to Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality experience were found but no success rate was observed because of unfamiliarity with the key features to the technology. There is a need to introduce the power of technology by engaging with it. A systematic approach to identify the key aspects of augmented reality and virtual reality for the successful adoption of business in customer relationship management sector has been used for the present study.

Design/methodology/approach: The approach is an analysis of the trends in human reproduction in the developed countries and a discussion of their implications for the travel, tourism and hospitality industries. Findings: There are three major solutions to the demographic problem faced in developed countries and the replacement of human labour with automation is the most practical, immediate and has the fewest risks and negative externalities. Practical implications: Industry has to adapt to the new demographic reality and embrace automation of services, educate their customers and have policies to deal with the resistance expected by labour. Social implications: Society can expect that many of the tasks they commonly expect humans to be involved in will be done by machines and artificial intelligence in the near future, if demographic trends continue and massive immigration into developed countries is not a continuing phenomenon.

Many major Internet companies have developed their application program interface (API) to provide sentiment analysis services for individuals and businesses. This study aims to test and evaluate current mainstream Chinese sentiment analysis applications. First, authentic online reviews are collected from Ctrip.com, a major online travel Agency in China, using a crawler. These reviews are then analyzed using major Chinese sentiment analysis APIs. Meanwhile, some interviewees were asked to classify and rate these reviews as positive, neutral or negative as well using a survey. After that, human-API discrepancy is compared and evaluated.

It is widely used because it allows you to make business models more efficient through edge intelligence, but there is still a lack of models to use for edge intelligence. Artificial neural networks are being used a lot because they solve the problem of overfitting, which is a disadvantage of artificial neural networks and increase the speed by improving GPU performance. However as the independent variable to be learned increases, the learning time and characteristics of the artificial neural network slow down and the size of the neural network becomes very heavier. The shortage of these artificial neural networks make it difficult to make edge intelligence for classification or prediction in real life. Manufacturing lightweight models using heavy neural networks and high-performance GPUs also presents a lot of financial problems. However, SVM based on statistical mathematics exists between machine learning. Although it is relatively inferior to artificial intelligence, it is better light and has stable performing. To do this, we propose an efficient data processing method that improves the characteristics of the SVM (the overall performance, accuracy and learning speed of the SVM) and makes it easier for the SVM to learn the data. When four types of data processing were applied, the accuracy increased by more than 0.4% for the iris data set and 2% on average for the other data sets, and the training time for all data sets was also reduced. As a result, SVMs that can process data efficiently are much lighter than artificial neural networks and have very good training times versus accuracy.

This can be especially pronounced when multiple technologies converge to create something new. Today, artificial intelligence (“AI”) is acting as an accelerant for such technology transformations. Still, the scope and depth of its impact will depend in part on our ability to address challenging problems that are surfacing without solutions. Industries will pursue AI for their corporate missions and to create shareholder value. But the timescales and applications can be incongruent with important public needs and with the longer research horizons required to make real progress. Public-Private partnerships are an important mechanism for tackling these rapidly emerging new, complex, challenging problems. This paper examines our experience gained by creating a unique public-private partnership to apply AI to one example of a hard problem that is particularly timely today— dramatically accelerating drug discovery. © 2020 ThinkBiotech LLC.

These organizations were each focused on different applications of digital health: Stentor was a venture capital backed, university spinoff focused in the field of digital radiology; Omnyx was formed as a joint venture (JV) by an academic medical center and industrial partner to transform the field of digital pathology; and, IBM Watson operating as an IBM unit, focused on the promise of artificial intelligence and machine learning for broad uses in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Each took a different organizational and business model path that resulted in mixed outcomes. While there are always many reasons for success or failure, we observe that these digital healthcare markets are more complex than typical consumer or technology markets. While any solution in healthcare demands patient centricity; healthcare markets additionally require a strong understanding and appreciation of the supporting ecosystem or network consisting of physicians and providers; and of constraints from payers and regulators. The value propositions of each member of the ecosystem must be understood and addressed. To meet this challenge, we advocate the formation of an integrated multidisciplinary commercialization team that addresses the multidimensional value proposition across the company life cycle. And importantly, that team should work collaboratively, and include service design as a key team member – along with the technology, business, marketing, reimbursement, and regulatory components. © 2020 ThinkBiotech LLC.

AI continues to evolve and grow, and plays an increasingly important role in the web app development space [1]. When it comes to developing innovative and more sophisticated web applications, the involved technologies continue to play a bigger role. With the involvement of the internet into our daily lives, particularly businesses are enjoying the aspects of AI. Precisely, companies use AI in proper marketing of their products and enhancing their brand visibility by building their websites and web applications [2]. AI or Machine Learning (ML) models are able to help web app developers to solve problems related to security, user experience, content analysis, quality assurance and much more. This presents the need for a framework or tool that can allow third party developers to seamlessly build an AI based app. In this paper, we present an AI Enabled Web Contents Authoring Framework (AWAF), where AI models can be simply dragged into workspace, provide options to build, train Deep learning models using a simple web visual interface, and ultimately ship the AI features into the web application. Also, we provide an option to connect together smart blocks called AI Nodes, to create our custom deep learning models. These AI Nodes are designed flexible enough to reap the advantages of portability and reusability. And, laterally, we also focus on assigning or distributing the computational AI Nodes to capable IOT-edge devices like high-end TV etc. to leverage their hardware capabilities in order to increase the overall responsiveness of the AI application on low-end devices [3]. © 2020 IEEE.","AI; Edge; Web Framework","Deep learning; E-learning; Quality assurance; Reusability; User experience; Websites; AI applications; Content analysis; Daily lives; Learning models; Third parties; Visual Interface; WEB application; Web development; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101519663

Therefore, it explores how knowledge, collaboration and learning cultures (including “acceptance of mistakes”) might help organizations overcome their resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach: The study used two sample groups: students aged 18–24 years (330 cases) and employees aged >24 years (326 cases), who worked in knowledge-driven organizations. Structural equation models were developed, assessed and compared. Findings: The effect of the “learning climate” on “adaptability to change” mediated by “acceptance of mistakes” has been detected for young students aged 18–24 years; however, this relationship is not significant for business employees aged >24 years. This result indicates that organizations, unlike universities, do not use mistakes as a tool to support learning that is to lead to change. Research limitations/implications: Both samples used in the study were obtained from Poland. The business sample was in the majority represented by small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, the presented findings may only be applicable to Poland. Practical implications: Acceptance of mistakes is vital for developing a learning culture. Mistakes help employees adapt to change. Hence, a learning culture that excludes the acceptance of mistakes is somehow artificial and may be unproductive. Paradoxically, the findings reveal that the fact that employees’ intelligence (adaptability to change) improves via mistakes does not mean that organizational intelligence will also increase. Thus, organizations that do not develop mechanisms of learning from mistakes lose the learning potential of their employees. Originality/value: This study proposes a constant learning culture scale that includes the “acceptance of mistakes” and “learning climate” dimensions. Further, it empirically proves the value of mistakes for adaptability to change. Moreover, it also contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating the mechanism of the relationship between knowledge, collaboration and learning cultures in the context of adaptability to change. This study breaks with the convention of “exaggerated excellence” and promotes the acceptance of mistakes in organizations to develop organizational intelligence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acceptance of mistakes; Adaptability to change; Collaborative culture; Constant learning culture; Knowledge culture; Organizational intelligence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088798418

Learning to think through practical methods develops critical thinking skills for dealing with super complexity since the frameworks the students use to consider when learning is contested and likely to change. There are some questions about whether educational institutions actually shape graduates prepared for practical and ethical engagement with their scholarly, professional, and personal worlds. The overall aim of this research paper is to provide the reader with insights trough the review and exploration of various current and emerging new technologies that might be adapted and used in high school education in order to help the development of a better educational system which is aligned with the requirements of the jobs market. Additionally, based on this research's results and further improvements based on new developments, a competitive business value proposition has been created, and together with several educational organizations, a proposal for a public policy on the topic will be developed in order to generate a qualitative paradigm shift and technological (r)evolution by reaching the attention of key decision-makers and stakeholders in the high school education in Romania’ environment. © 2020, Pro Global Science Association.

From the last two years, there is a lot of data generation and execution is taking rise due to feasible technologies and devices. To make the information accessible with ease, we need to classify the information data and predict an accurate or at least an approximate expected result which is forwarded to the end user client. To achieve the said process, the information technology industries are more concerned with machine learning and edge computing. Machine learning is a integral subset of artificial intelligence. In machine learning, the foremost step towards achieving the above task is to observe the data which is produced in large amount, later classify the data to make the system learn (train) from the old data (experience) that is stored at the server level and finally predict an estimation as a result. The obtained result is been transformed onto the devices which have made a request for a particular data. These devices are remotely located at the corner of the central data center. The process in which the execution of the information data is done at the corner of the data center is called as edge computing. In today's world of high computation, these two technologies i.e machine learning and edge computing are creating an overwhelming significance for its usage in the business market and end user clients.

In a time where we are only beginning to witness artificial intelligence’s disruption of work and the economy, these learning outcomes are crucial to personal and professional success. This paper begins by tracing the role of the Discussion Method within the liberal arts tradition, and by extension the Confucian tradition. Second, this paper examines how the Discussion Method lost its value in higher education as a consequence of the employability problem. In this section, the employability problem is defined as a two-fold misunderstanding among students and parents regarding the purpose of education and how to prepare for the workplace. Third, this paper reframes the purpose of the Discussion Method in an integrated curriculum for preparing students to achieve personal and professional success. Also, in the third section, student generated data serve as evidence to support the argument that (1) discussion-based classes are an important missing element in undergraduate management education and (2) discussion-based classes are superior to large lectures. This paper concludes that a discussion-based business pedagogy anchored by the liberal arts and sciences leads to eight major learning outcomes: (1) how to reconcile opposing arguments; (2) how to think on one’s own two feet; (3) how to formulate cohesive arguments to reach a consensus; (4) how to mitigate fear of sharing individual opinions by building relationship among classmates; (5) how to allow students to learn better by motivating them to prepare more for class; (6) how to enable students to remain engaged during and after class; (7) how to embraces nuance; and (8) how to integrate new ideas from disparate perspectives and disciplines. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business education; Discussion-based learning; Integrated learning; Liberal arts",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124999345

With the advancement in information technology, communication became much easier than before. However, the problem of emotional distance still remains unsolved. Having too much communication out of sheer desire to get partner's information can be invasion of privacy. Research efforts are currently being made in various approaches, but it is difficult to have a 'realistic experience' of actually being with the partner.

However, in the recommender systems research community, we have fallen prey to a McNamara fallacy to a worrying extent: In the majority of our research efforts, we rely almost exclusively on computational measures such as prediction accuracy, which are easier to make than applying other evaluation methods. However, it remains unclear whether small improvements in terms of such computational measures matter greatly and whether they lead us to better systems in practice. A paradigm shift in terms of our research culture and goals is therefore needed. We can no longer focus exclusively on abstract computational measures but must direct our attention to research questions that are more relevant and have more impact in the real world. In this work, we review the various ways of how recommender systems may create value; how they, positively or negatively, impact consumers, businesses, and the society; and how we can measure the resulting effects. Through our analyses, we identify a number of research gaps and propose ways of broadening and improving our methodology in a way that leads us to more impactful research in our field.

Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer—being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging—has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary. © 2020, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Computer-aided diagnosis systems; Deep learning; Distributed learning; Hybrid imaging; Imaging biomarkers; Machine learning; Natural language processing; PET/CT; Radiomics",,Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100671063

Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like. © 2020 IEEE.","capsule network; creativity; EEG; insight; spectrogram","Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Cognitive styles; Convergent thinkings; Creative abilities; EEG analysis; ITS applications; Performance analysis; Pre-processing; State-of-the-art techniques; Intelligent computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099691389

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. Results: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine. Conclusions: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19.

Notably, major technical shifts in e-commerce aim to influence customer behavior in favor of some products and brands. Artificial intelligence (AI) comes on board as an essential innovative tool for personalization and customizing products to meet specific demands. This research finds that, despite the contribution of AI systems in e-commerce, its ethical soundness is a contentious issue, especially regarding the concept of explainability. The study adopted the use of word cloud analysis, voyance analysis, and concordance analysis to gain a detailed understanding of the idea of explainability as has been utilized by researchers in the context of AI. Motivated by a corpus analysis, this research lays the groundwork for a uniform front, thus contributing to a scientific breakthrough that seeks to formulate Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models. XAI is a machine learning field that inspects and tries to understand the models and steps involved in how the black box decisions of AI systems are made; it provides insights into the decision points, variables, and data used to make a recommendation. This study suggested that, to deploy explainable XAI systems, ML models should be improved, making them interpretable and comprehensible. © 2020 by the author.

Most governments have implemented recovery plans similar to those that were then implemented. However, there are differences in the economic impact that require different methodologies which focus on the microenvironment. Entrepreneurs’ sponsorship may help to recover the current socio-economic situation. Simultaneously, technological progress in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data allows the analysis of vast amounts of information and support decision making. This paper shows a brief introduction of entrepreneurship policy in twenty countries after the irruption of the Covid-19 to contextualize, and applies Artificial Intelligence to examine factors whose influence is strong in the survival rate of entrepreneurs within a public support program. Specifically, two types of artificial networks are used: self-organizing maps and multilayer perceptron (respectively, SOM and MLP). After the application of neural networks on a data set of 2,221 entrepreneurs from Andalusia (Spain) and with 769 variables taken during the recovery after the crisis from 2008 to 2012, the prediction in the probability of entrepreneurial survival and business success is shown to be realistic in more than 98% of individuals analysed. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Artificial neural networks (ANN); Entrepreneurship; Multilayer perceptron (MLP); Self-organizing maps (SOM); Sponsorship",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097103819

The principal research methods that determine the logic and practical basis of the application of fuzzy logic in entrepreneurship are highlighted. It has been determined that fuzzy modeling is effective when technological processes are too complex for analysis using generally accepted quantitative methods, or when available sources of information in the business environment are interpreted poorly, inaccurately, and indefinitely. It has been shown experimentally that fuzzy logic gives better results compared to those obtained with generally accepted algorithms for analyzing the quality of doing business. A model of a neuro-fuzzy regulator has been developed and measures for its implementation in the business environment have been proposed. A neural network model in entrepreneurial development has been formed. Studies have shown the possibility of effective use of the principles of artificial intelligence and modeling in solving problems of developing entrepreneurial potential and making business decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This ensures objective and well-grounded decision-making in solving various applied problems of business development and taking into account environmental factors. The applied tasks of supporting the adoption of entrepreneurial decisions in the conditions are formulated; uncertainty; indicating that approaches to decision-making under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic tools are universal and require appropriate careful study and adaptation to a specific applied problem in the business environment. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.","Entrepreneurship; Genetic algorithm; Linguistic rule; Neural network; Object of control; Regulators",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097023069

Tourists are the main source of income for gross domestic income in Indonesia. However, although Indonesia as a beautiful archipelago country has so much offer to foreign and local tourist, until now it fails to give their potential to the country. Furthermore, the COVID-19 situation made Indonesia tourism worse. Travelling is banned as a consequence of lockdown in Indonesia. Business and economic need to adjust into their new normal. Unfortunately, in the midst of the current era of Internet technology and new normal, Indonesia’s tourism promotion is considered to be uneven and unwell targeted. Many tourist destinations are very interesting and clean but not yet known by potential tourists both from domestic and abroad due to the lack of targeted promotions and re-branding of a safe place to visit. Seeing to this prob-lem, this study aims to propose an integrated tourism system called SONIA, by using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to build a personalized recommender system.

Websites of firms are a particularly interesting data source for innovation research, as they are used for publishing information about potentially innovative products, services, and cooperation with other firms. Analyzing the textual and relational content on these websites and extracting innovation-related information from them has the potential to provide researchers and policy-makers with a cost-effective way to survey millions of businesses and gain insights into their innovation activity, their cooperation, and applied technologies. For this purpose, we propose a web mining framework for consistent and reproducible mapping of innovation ecosystems. In a large-scale pilot study we use a database with 2.4 million German firms to test our framework and explore firm websites as a data source. Thereby we put particular emphasis on the investigation of a potential bias when surveying innovation systems through firm websites if only certain firm types can be surveyed using our proposed approach. We find that the availability of a websites and the characteristics of the website (number of subpages and hyperlinks, text volume, language used) differs according to firm size, age, location, and sector. We also find that patenting firms will be overrepresented in web mining studies. Web mining as a survey method also has to cope with extremely large and hyper-connected outlier websites and the fact that low broadband availability appears to prevent some firms from operating their own website and thus excludes them from web mining analysis. We then apply the proposed framework to map an exemplary innovation ecosystem of Berlin-based firms that are engaged in artificial intelligence. Finally, we outline several approaches how to transfer firm website content into valuable innovation indicators. © 2020, The Author(s).","Innovation; Web mining; Web scraping",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092590549

The arrival of this traffic is periodic, which remains high during certain time duration (known as peak or working/office hour) each day, resulting in an increase in the resource bottleneck problem, which causes high connections blocking. Due to these, many commercial and business data services may lose their connections which contain the urgent and important information. In order to handle such a critical situation in elastic optical networks (EONs), prioritization of connection requests based on the differentiated class of service (CoS) is a must. In this paper, the network traffic is categorized into three CoS requests. These are CoS1 (real-time traffic), CoS2 (nonreal-time traffic), and CoS3 (delay-tolerant traffic) and proposed a cost function-based CoS provisioning (CFCoSP) strategy in which the connection requests are served as per an increasing value of cost function. The cost function is a cumulative function of CoS, pathlength, and requested bandwidth demand (i.e., number of frequency slots required). The simulations are performed on INDIAN and ARPANET network topologies under uniform CoS ratio (i.e., CoS1:CoS2:CoS3 = 1:1:1) on the metrics of connection established, bandwidth blocking probability, resource utilization ratio, and network capacity utilization. The simulation results verify that the proposed CFCoSP strategy shows significantly improved performances as compared to an existing non-cost CoS provisioning (CoSP) strategy on the investigated metrics. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","class of service; cost function; elastic optical network; prioritization; RSA; wavelength division multiplexing","Artificial intelligence; Bandwidth; Blocking probability; Cobalt compounds; Fiber optic networks; Internet of things; Bandwidth blocking probabilities; Bottleneck problem; Elastic optical networks; Internet of Things (IOT); Non-real time traffics; Real time traffics; Resource utilization ratios; Store and forward; Cost functions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092361594

The AHP was used to determine the hierarchal weight of each decision-making criterion and its consistency, while the PROMETHEE method was used to carry out the overall process evaluation. Additionally, the fuzzy set theory was infused into the hierarchical structure analysis to evaluate the quantitative economic criterion to curb uncertainty and imprecision. The results of the analysis show that the technology alternative A3 – Artificial Intelligence (AI) – is the most preferred alternative, which outranks other comparative technologies. The approach proposed in this study can help provide the basis for any technology adopting mining company to build its technology business case, strategy and or roadmap to achieve the desired outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Decision-making; Fuzzy multiple attribute; MCDM; Mining technology; PROMETHEE","Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Fuzzy set theory; Hierarchical systems; Mining; Uncertainty analysis; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Conceptual frameworks; Decision making criteria; Emerging technologies; Hierarchical structures; Multi-criteria method; Multi-criterial decision making; Technology adoption; Decision making; analytical hierarchy process; conceptual framework; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; mine; mining; multicriteria analysis; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091591857

It aims to instantly remind users of the identities of those who they met before in parties or conferences. When greeted, one, who is correctly identified, may frequently feel more respected than another who is mistaken for someone else in the first place. The golden rule suggests one to treat others with respect, and then others will treat the one with respect in return. Empirically, making others feel respected can definitely facilitate communication among people for social and particularly business purposes. For this sake, this paper employed a pair of smart glasses as a hardware platform into which a deep learning-based multi-task cascaded convolutional networks and a FaceNet algorithm were integrated. This move provided a high face recognition accuracy and a strong robustness. In the end, this smart device as intended recognized captured images and displayed the identities of matched contacts in a face image database.

The strategy consists of a business intelligence summary of AI trends and challenges of interest to academic institutions with an emphasis in intelligent human–computer communication and interactive design and manufacturing for educating engineers for the future enterprise. We also present a case study that builds upon 35 years of experience in offering AI academic programs in the institution, Tecnologico de Monterrey (Tec) to educate future engineers and knowledge workers. The components of our case study comprise graduate and undergraduate courses, research, internships, innovation, internationalization initiatives, and entrepreneurship. In this period, more than 5200 students have been trained at the Ph.D., MSc, and undergraduate levels with intense use of technology in the AI field. Now, the curricula of the university have been overhauled and renewed according to a new educative model known as the Tec21 Educative Model. The course offerings under this model are structured with challenge-based-learning, physical and virtual practice labs, and mixed teaching methodologies to accommodate the digital transformation and demands of Industry 4.0 to educate and prepare the new generation of students.

It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Cultural drift; Knowledge Management System (KMS); Machine learning sustainability; Sustainable business models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090582835

In many industries, there are classical models that capture the fundamentals of general planning decisions (e.g., designing a delivery route). However, these models are generic and often require customization to truly reflect the realities of specific operational settings. Yet, such customization can be an expensive and time-consuming process. At the same time, popular cloud computing software platforms such as Software as a Service (SaaS) are not amenable to customized software applications. We present a framework that has the potential to autonomously customize optimization models by learning mathematical representations of customer-specific business rules from historical data derived from model solutions and implemented plans. Because of the wide-spread use in practice of mixed integer linear programs (MILP) and the power of MILP solvers, the framework is designed for MILP models. It uses a common mathematical representation for different optimization models and business rules, which it encodes in a standard data structure. As a result, a software provider employing this framework can develop and maintain a single code-base while meeting the needs of different customers. We assess the effectiveness of this framework on multiple classical MILPs used in the planning of logistics and supply chain operations and with different business rules that must be observed by implementable plans. Computational experiments based on synthetic data indicate that solutions to the customized optimization models produced by the framework are regularly of high-quality. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimization modeling; Statistical learning","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Embedded systems; Integer programming; Supply chains; Cloud computing softwares; Computational experiment; Data-driven optimization; Mathematical representations; Mixed integer linear program; Optimization models; Organizational planning; Supply chain operation; Software as a service (SaaS)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086372620

The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of understanding of data are holding back the development and implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time. © 2020, The Author(s).","Algorithms-based learning; Artificial intelligence; Business models; Educational technology; Further education; Higher education; Learning analytics",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083979918

It is informed by extensive fieldwork throughout the world1, 2 and the authors’ combined experience in retail and technology. Beyond commerce, we see all industries facing a future of transformation. But retailers have historically coped with disruption, and we believe the dramatic pace of changes and opportunity facing them can be a playbook for executives in all businesses. Retailers have to operate 24/7, 365 days a year — at full speed and with narrow margins. An immense challenge is making step changes while not simply discarding existing mission-critical infrastructure.The retail industry will enter this unknown future with existing systems that must become far more effective with incremental technology, digitally enhanced employees and pervasive data management across the whole organisation. In other words, they must operate with the capabilities they have for today while transforming for tomorrow.This becomes more complex as smart homes, smart stores and connected cities advance. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.","Alibaba; Amazon; Artificial intelligence (AI); Connected consumer; Data; Digital transformation; FinTech; Frictionless transactions; Future store; Grocery channel; Motion sensors; Retail operations; Robotics; Shopping in the future; Smart homes; Voice technologies",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081303277

When repetitive tasks can be accurately duplicated through automation, the decision becomes a fait accompli. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) or synthetic intelligence that simulates human intellectual function has significant impact potential in the service sector. This paper examines productivity efficiencies sought through artificial intelligence and the need for re-training, specifically in the accounting profession. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper for practitioners without research methodology. Findings: The accounting profession 10 years from now will look noticeably different than it does now. The accountants, who embrace the new technologies, like artificial intelligence, will survive and even thrive by becoming more specialized. This will require training and, in some instances, re-training. Organizations must be willing to absorb those development costs. I hope that new graduates will enter the profession with updated skills providing added value for organizations and employers who started into the profession many years ago. The biggest challenge may lie in the re-training of accountants who have been in practice for many years and managing the resistance to change. Employers must first set the example by accepting the inevitable and then encourage and support employees to improve and update their skills. Additionally, they will have to coach employees through the changes with reassurance that those who embrace the change will experience less chance of job elimination. Embracing the available technology will enable firms to serve clients more efficiently and effectively by providing up to date business solutions regardless of the services being offered. Research limitations/implications: There is no empirical research in this paper. It is a conceptual piece looking at the changing organization in accounting, specifically due to artificial intelligence. Practical implications: Accounting firms that focus on basic accounting functions should find new services to offer. The same clients can be served, but at a higher-level. Accountants will offer more value to clients by detecting patterns and trends when more time can be devoted to analysis. Helping clients beyond the preparation of documents requires that accountants understand the current market conditions and potential effects of inflation and, engage in more critical thinking while at the same time be able to teach clients and help them understand at the higher level. Just as accountants’ responsibilities and duties will be transformed through the integration of AI, accounting education must be altered. Social implications: Implications related to the workplace are only discussed in this paper. Originality/value: It is not completely original. It is a compilation of research that is out there as a means to address critical workforce training needs in accounting as technology moves forward. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accounting; Artificial intelligence; Organizational change",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079176145

Findings: Although technological advancements are already transforming the workplace, the optimal benefits of these technologies will be realized only in collaboration with human capital. In particular, as certain manual and technical skills are replaced by automation, the jobs that remain will require more highly developed social and cognitive skills such as creative problem solving, interpersonal skills and empathy, and adaptability and continuous learning. Practical implications: Learning professionals are encouraged to use strategies that leverage the power of curiosity to cultivate the soft skills critical for success in technologically advanced workplaces.

Digital technologies for data processing and communication underly high-impact innovations including the Internet of Things, wireless multimedia, artificial intelligence, big data, enterprise platforms, social networks and blockchain. These digital innovations not only bring new opportunities for prosperity and wellbeing but also affect our behaviors, activities, and daily lives. They enable and shape new forms of production and new working practices in sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and supply chains, energy, and public and business services. Digital innovations are not purely technological but form part of comprehensive systemic innovations of a sociotechnical and networked nature, requiring the alignment of technology, processes, organizations, and humans. Examples are platform-based work, customer driven value creating networks, and urban public service systems. Building on widespread networking, algorithmic decisions and sharing of personal data, these innovations raise intensive societal and ethical debates regarding key issues such as data sovereignty and privacy intrusion, business models based on data surveillance and negative externalization, quality of work and jobs, and market dominance versus regulation. In this context, this book focuses on the implications of digitalization for the domain of work. The book studies the changing nature of work as well as new forms of digitally enabled organizations, work practices and cooperation. The book sheds light on the technological, economic, and political forces shaping the new world of work and on the prospects for human-centric and responsible innovations. To this end, the book brings together a number of studies in five major topics: 1. The evolution of digital technology impacting ways of working; 2. The role of artificial intelligence in new ways of working; 3. Transformation of work, jobs and employment; 4. Digitalization and need for skills and competencies; and 5.

In parallel, the rapidly changing digital trends indicate further challenges to find relevant definitions or theories for new media. The study argues that the most definitive trends are rooted in the technology-driven paradigm shifts from digitalisation to smart and (narrow) AI [2]. These principal paradigms of digital technology facilitate the changing media logics [3] with several facilitators and effects in society, culture and business [4]. The question is how technological trends and their business models are manifested and what kind of forces, needs and values support them. Thus, the purpose of the study is to conceptualise the changing new media landscape along the digital transformation [5]. The method, trend level analysis supports the understanding. Additionally, Fjord trend report [6] extends this conceptualisation with interpretative and human-focused metaphors from designed intelligence to unusual business approach.

The analysis is done on different techniques and variations of known methods regarding their characteristics like speed, performance, and effectiveness using scientific methods, statistics and mathematical proofs. On the other end of the spectrum, a lot of research has been done on high-level data mining as well. The research on data mining usually stops at technical implementations and focuses mainly on high-level techniques to manipulate the bulk of data to be mined. The physical implementation is usually abstracted and left for libraries to optimize. In order to use this research in the area of big data, the areas of AI and Data mining need to be conjoined so that the appropriate knowledge from both technical and conceptual areas is used. The purpose of this literature review is to systematically review the research done on both the technical and conceptual ends of the spectrum and to find the overlapping techniques. This is needed to get a clear understanding of the entire knowledge extraction process from big data to business value. The research results in a broad view of all techniques and their appropriateness towards big data. In order to make decisions on the techniques used for a specific data mining problem, a broad view of all available solutions is needed.

Merchants tend to better understand users' attitudes and emotional tendencies through comments. As the number of user reviews increases, the previous sentiment analysis methods have highlighted the problems of high cost and high error rate. How to use more advanced methods to analyse comments has become an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve the above problems, in this article, we propose a fine-grained sentiment analysis method based on dependency tree and graph neural network, which can help businesses and social network platforms to identify users' sentiment tendencies and can be subsequently used in recommendation systems and public opinion analysis systems.

Imbalanced data have been proven to reduce the performance of machine learning algorithms, where imbalance data means that the total data from each class is significantly different. The proposed method is evaluated using a dataset from the UCI repository and area under the curve (AUC) as the main evaluation. The results have shown that the proposed method produces good performance. (AUC 0.8). Overall the second experiment outperformed and was better than the first and third experiments because the main evaluation in the unbalanced class classification isAUC. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed method produces optimal performance both for large scale data sets. Overall the second experiment outperformed and better than the first and third experiments, because the main evaluation in the unbalanced class classification was AUC. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cellular telephones; Feature extraction; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mobile commerce; Purchasing; Sales; Area under the curves; Business to business; Electronic device; Intention predictions; Large scale data sets; Online shopping; Optimal performance; Selection techniques; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097173482

Within the EU, geographical location of cucumber firms determines production infrastructure and need of heating, cooling and lighting energy, while variable demand, producer and export/import prices, and market structure shape business models, profitability and competition between firms. Better climate management to sustain product quality and yields is a common goal to European cucumber production in all countries despite technological differences of greenhouses. Energy use reductions in the northern and western and water use and water pollution reductions in the southern cucumber greenhouses are the primary challenges. Semi-closed greenhouse, now instrumentalized in several commercial greenhouse types, more efficient use of natural and artificial lighting and artificial intelligence make the core of new production concepts. Extending seasons to produce year-round disrupts the traditional division of labor in cucumber production between northern/western and southern countries and intensifies competition. Cucumber market segmentation based on consumer preferences for intrinsic and extrinsic quality components could be extended to differentiate the design of the management of whole supply chains, but is challenging due to differing interests of supply chain members. Cucumber production impacts but is also impacted by climate warming by several ways that require adaptation measures by the industy.

This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase. Findings: AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes. Research limitations/implications: AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure. Originality/value: This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Business value; Cases studies; Firm performance; Process innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084434769

It suggests that the potential operating efficiency of a service is inversely related to the extent of customer contact with the provider's operations and that various service design issues are dictated by the presence or absence of customer contact. The purpose of this article is to reevaluate the customer contact approach in light of advanced digital technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors review the origins and history of the customer contact approach and show ways it has been refined in research literature. From that they demonstrate how the refined approach can be applied to contemporary conditions. Findings: Recent advances in digital technologies have indeed required us to revise our conceptualization of customer contact. There is now a blurring between front-office and back-office operations. Emerging technologies are allowing customers to have high-contact experiences with low-contact efficiencies. Research limitations/implications: Going forward, conceptualizations of customer contact are becoming increasingly complex and requiring increasingly complex models. Armed with self-service technologies, customers are able to permeate the “buffered core” of service businesses. Artificial intelligence and anthropomorphic devices have further blurred the distinction between front-office and back-office operations. Research will need to consider new forms of technology-enabled customer contact. Practical implications: Customer contact is no longer limited to interpersonal interactions and the relationships between service providers and customers are increasingly complex. Customers may interact with automated service providers, or service providers may interact with customer technologies. New forms of customer contact may not involve humans at all, but instead involve technologies interacting with technologies. Originality/value: The customer contact approach to service was one of the original models of service design. By revisiting and revising the model we bring it in-line with the realities of the contemporary service economy. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer contact; Service design; Service theory; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082197898

Soon the EDA research community made proposals on applying AI in EDA and all major players announced new AI-based tools at DAC 2018. Unfortunately, few new AI-based EDA-tools made it to productive use today. This talk analyses general challenges of AI in EDA, outlines promising use cases, and motivates more AI research in EDA: More HI (=Human Intelligence) is needed to make AI successful in EDA. Motivation: For a long time, hardware design resides in an area between hell of complexity and hell of physics. Continuously decreasing feature size enables to put more and more transistors on a square millimeter silicon. This offers to make continuously new applications at a reasonable form factor. However, the functionality of the application must be designed first and the deep submicron effects must be considered properly. EDA tools help to automate design, but face challenges keeping up with the continuously increasing productivity demand. Therefore, the design teams have increased in size to step up the design of the chips. So, any further innovation is welcome. The rediscovery of AI in general and ML in particular created visions of learning from designers and automatically creating automation from these learnings. To give an example, Google describes in [1] how to accelerate Chip Placement from weeks to hours. Problem statement: There are three main challenges to foster the use of AI in EDA. First, it is not straightforward to come up with a business model for AI in EDA. The open question is, which amount of improvement users do expect without paying higher license fees. Also, how much would they be willing to pay for a tool which improves the overall efficiency and reduces the number of licenses for other tools in use. Second, AI requires large amount of data for learning. A common infrastructural setup cost in gathering the technology specific design data is high due to long tool runs and additional license cost at the user end.. For instance, setting the right tool switches for optimum compile and synthesis is a good application area for AI in EDA. Reports about optimizing the “gcc” compiler and “Vivado” show the potential of this technology. However there is no solution for R2G tools available. Third, AI methods cannot be easily integrated into EDA solutions. E.g. Infineon developed with a partner an approach to optimize the pattern of a regression run. Efficiency improvements of over 60% were reached. However, it works with pre-generated pattern only, since there was no way to integrate the approach in a UVM simulator. Approach: In the context of design automation, Infineon is using AI for cost estimation and optimization in early design phases [2]. Here, AI shows its strength since it is able to handle a quite uncorrelated set of data such as SW memory size and SW execution time, and the dependency on hardware structure, implementation style and optimization level. This is enabled by the Infineon MDA code generation framework to automatically make a wide variety of consistent HW- and SW implementations to train the AI [3]. Furthermore, Infineon starts to make use of OpenROAD [4] to collect ASIC relevant data and clearly welcomes all further research that goes into this framework. Since this only partially solves the challenge of a sufficient amount of training data, Infineon sees research demand in pre-processing ASIC data and/or approaches to use pre-learned networks. Both are needed to apply AI techniques in several technology domains and variants releasing from the burden of exhaustively retraining the AI. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Artificial Intelligence; Early Design Analysis; Open Source EDA","Automation; Cost estimating; Data handling; Efficiency; Integrated circuit design; Machine learning; Object recognition; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Design automations; Early design phasis; Efficiency improvement; Hardware structures; Human intelligence; Optimization levels; Overall efficiency; Research communities; Electronic design automation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098264011

As a workaround, many applications will have an offline process to crunch these numbers and present the results after many hours. In our case, the solution was an offline process taking 24 hours to onboard a customer resulting in a potential loss of business. To solve this problem, we have built a new real-time prediction system using MinHash and HyperLogLog (HLL) data sketches to compute the device reach at runtime when a user makes a request. However, existing MinHash implementations do not solve the complex problem of multilevel aggregation and intersection.

This paper tries to join the MES system with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in order to not only monitor the system but having predictive analysis to plan the future. In such way we will take advantage of the benefits of the ANN, such as Long-Short Term Memory architectures. The experimental data will be compared with other usual platforms, such as the Master SCADA itself, through the course of this research. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097088531

The data center is the middle layer that mediates the contradiction between the foreground and the background[2]. It provides a reusable, standardized, and agile multifunctional platform through the modeling of background data and the aggregation of data services to support the foreground for the demand[3] of quickly change according to market changes. Through the data center, we have opened up the data islands of each business system. However, when each business system uses data, it found that the data quality is poor, unstable, not timely, and inconsistent. Traditional cluster data quality monitoring has the characteristics of inconsistent data quality requirements for various services, difficult development, low processing efficiency, difficult maintenance, and insufficient intelligence. Based on this situation, we design a data quality monitoring system based on rules and artificial intelligence. General users perform simple configuration on the interface to complete real-time online monitoring of data, and real-time statistics on the number of data quality problems and a detailed list for users to trace the cause of the problem and identify abnormal scenarios in advance. The comparison between experiments and mainstream products proves that the system has greatly improved in terms of user use and flexibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Artificial intelligence; Data reduction; Business systems; Inconsistent data; Information overloads; Intelligent monitoring systems; Multifunctional platforms; Number of datum; Online monitoring; Real-time statistics; Monitoring",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096567187

In this paper, an integration strategy of multi-period collaborative optimization for production planning and scheduling based on data-driven yield model is proposed. Both expert knowledge and historical production data are used to build the yield model of unit. Considering the purchase plan of raw material, inventory of current raw material, sales price of product and equipment production, the multi-period planning and scheduling collaborative optimization strategy (MPSCOS) is established dynamically. The plan and industry production scheme of raw material processing can quickly be obtained by MPSCOS, which helps gain maximum benefit under the condition of safe production.

This paper first evaluates the real data by combining the principal component analysis model and obtains the main factors affecting the price of the route, including transportation cost, platform transaction mode, the number of uncertain factors of tasks, drivers' preference/business scenario, the complexity of the execution process, transaction difficulty and renewal status. On the other hand, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation model of principal components to evaluate the price in the historical transaction data of freight lines. Combined with the actual situation, this paper establishes a multiple regression model and solves it by using the least square method to obtain the mathematical relationship of route pricing. The results show that the research in this paper can effectively reduce the cost of transportation, improve the speed of transactions, and have a certain guiding role for the development of the Non-Truck Operating Common carrier industry. © 2020 IEEE.","Least square method; Multiobjective optimization; Multiple regression; Non-Truck Operating Common Carrier; Principal component analysis","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cost benefit analysis; Least squares approximations; Regression analysis; Transportation routes; Truck transportation; Trucks; Comprehensive evaluation model; Cost of transportation; Evaluation standard; Least square methods; Mathematical relationship; Multiple regression model; Principal Components; Transportation cost; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099307879

Every attack carried out has the potential to exploit the system on a large scale. Various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to defend such vulnerabilities. This paper analyzes a novel attack and extracts attackers' intrusion scenarios. Evolutionary Computation Techniques have been remarkably used in the field of cybersecurity. This paper particularly discusses the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDoS) attack. The effect of this attack ranges from a disturbance of an elementary service to causing major threats to critical services. In recent times these attacks have become more intricate and carry a significant threat. Therefore, there is a necessity for an intelligent Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to recognize attacks. In this study, work is carried on the latest dataset called Modern DDoS. This paper comprises of comparing the results of six established classification techniques: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) with the proposed Genetic Programming model.

Moore's law supports this argument, by stating that the computing power doubles every two years. In such a premise, many IT companies have risen to meet the challenges. These companies provide various solutions in various fields of enterprises, pushing the limits of technology. Human resource is considered the most important asset in any organization. In order to utilize this asset beneficially, an organization must have great Human Resource Management practices. This includes practices from recruitment until employee termination. One great employee can offset the work of several regular employees. IT companies strive to acquire and retain such talent. But this is not a simple task. It requires resources including manpower and time. There should be knowledgeable individuals to handle important human resource processes, and many organizations lack these. They do not have enough time or labor to invest in good human resource processes. This research proposes a solution to this problem by creating a Business Intelligence Assistant for Human Resource Management Targeting Information Technology companies. It delves into Human Resource Management practices revolving around employee recruitment, job placing, employee engagement and human resource decision making. The solution consists of four solutions, namely; Structured Resume Analyzer, Smart Candidate Ranker, Employee Engagement Survey Generator and Business Intelligence Processor. Each component will enable the organization to streamline certain processes helping them save both time and labor. The individual components will make use of various applications of artificial intelligence to aid in the decision-making of an organization. © 2020 IEEE.","Business Intelligence; Employee Engagement; Employee Recruitment; Human Resource Management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Employment; Information analysis; Information management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Computing power; Employee engagement; Employee termination; Human resource is; Human resource management practices; Individual components; IT companies; Moore's Law; Human resource management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100467701

The framework was conceived as a decision support tool for industrial business, encompassing the whole big data analytical process. The first module incorporates in big data analytical a mapping of processes and variables, which is not common in such processes. This is a proposal that proved to be adequate in the practical application that was developed. Next, an analytical “workbench” was implemented for data management and exploratory analysis (Modules 2 and 3) and, finally, in Module 4, the implementation of artificial intelligence algorithm support predictive processes. The modules are adaptable to different types of industry and problems and can be applied independently. The paper presents a real-world application seeking as final objective the implementation of a predictive maintenance decision support tool in a hydroelectric power plant. The process mapping in the plant identified four subsystems and 100 variables. With the support of the analytical workbench, all variables have been properly analyzed. All underwent a cleaning process and many had to be transformed, before being subjected to exploratory analysis. A predictive model, based on a decision tree (DT), was implemented for predictive maintenance of equipment, identifying critical variables that define the imminence of an equipment failure. This DT model was combined with a time series forecasting model, based on artificial neural networks, to project those critical variables for a future time. The real-world application showed the practical feasibility of the framework, particularly the effectiveness of the analytical workbench, for pre-processing and exploratory analysis, as well as the combined predictive model, proving effectiveness by providing information on future events leading to equipment failures. © 2020 by the authors.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists’ intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human–machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists. © 2020 by the authors.

Besides, Internet users may start to form an opinion and make certain personal or business decisions based on misinformation, leading to undesirable consequences. This paper introduces WhistleBlower, a decentralized and open platform based on the blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for spotting fake news. The key components of WhistleBlower include a fake news processing engine powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, a verifiable computation engine, and a token-curated registry (TCR).WhistleBlower allows the community members to participate in the fake news identification process by running the fake news detection algorithm on their nodes, which would then be validated by a verifiable computation engine to ensure that the public nodes executed the computation honestly and correctly. Whenever a news feed is submitted to WhistleBlower for fake news assessment, it issues a genuineness score, which can then be posted along with the news article to let the newsreaders gauge its legitimacy. However, the genuineness score's accuracy depends on the machine learning model's effectiveness that processes the news item. To improve the machine learning algorithm's reliability, we introduce a Token-curated registry, which enables the public and community members to challenge the algorithm used to estimate the genuineness score. TCR lets the community curate fake news detection algorithms by providing feedback to the ML/AI algorithm developers through the token-curated content moderation process. WhistleBlower is the first open and democratic fake news assessment platform that combines ML/AI, verifiable computation, and TCR to the best of our knowledge. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Fake news; TCR; Token curated registry; Verifiable computation; WhistleBlower","Blockchain; Engines; Machine learning; Signal detection; Social networking (online); Business decisions; Computation engine; Detection algorithm; Digital platforms; Identification process; Machine learning models; Processing engine; Social networking applications; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099258484

This can be achieved, in the case of recommender systems, with personalization. However, with a combinatorial online learning approach, personalization implies a large amount of user feedbacks. Such feedbacks can be hard to acquire when users need to be directly and frequently solicited. For a number of fields of activities undergoing the digitization of their business, online learning is unavoidable. Thus, a number of approaches allowing implicit user feedback retrieval have been implemented. Nevertheless, this implicit feedback can be misleading or inefficient for the agent's learning. Herein, we propose a novel approach reducing the number of explicit feedbacks required by Combinatorial Multi Armed bandit (COM-MAB) algorithms. We evaluate it using three distinct strategies. Despite a limited number of feedbacks returned by users (as low as 20% of the total), our approach obtains similar results to those of state of the art approaches. © 2020 IEEE.","Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits; Learning Speed; Recommendations System; Reinforcement Learning; User Feedbacks","E-learning; Explicit feedback; Implicit feedback; Large amounts; Multi armed bandit; Online learning; Personalizations; State-of-the-art approach; User feedback; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098762794

For business applications, identifying disjoint clusters of homogeneous databases contributes to learning the common patterns among customers and also increases profits by targeting potential clients in the future. In this paper, we present an effective approach to search for the optimal clustering of multiple transactional databases in a weighted undirected similarity graph. To assess the clustering quality, we use dual gradient descent to minimize a constrained quasi-convex loss function whose parameters will determine the edges needed to form the optimal database clusters in the graph. Therefore, finding the global minimum is guaranteed in a finite and short time compared with the existing non-convex objectives where all possible candidate classifications are generated to find the ideal clustering. Moreover, our algorithm does not require specifying the number of clusters a priori and uses a disjoint-set forest data structure to maintain and keep track of the clusters as they are updated. We have performed extensive experiments on public data samples and compared our algorithm with one of the best previous algorithms for clustering multiple databases. Our experimental study shows that our algorithm performs better than the previous algorithms in terms of accuracy and running time. © 2020 IEEE.","convex optimization; dual gradient descent; frequent item-sets; graph clustering; multi-database mining","Artificial intelligence; Distributed database systems; Global optimization; Gradient methods; Graphic methods; Business applications; Effective approaches; Graph-based clustering; Multi-database mining; Multi-national corporations; Number of clusters; Optimal clustering; Transactional database; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098755824

Network slicing is advocated by the research community to simultaneously support multiple services on a common physical infrastructure. Federated network slicing, which involves multiple operators, further generalizes the concept to cover a broader range. Existing federated slicing systems advocate the master-slave architecture among untrusted operators, which brings some centralization concern, making operators hesitate to join the system. Recently, blockchain shows great power to build trust in decentralized environments. Besides, artificial intelligence (Ai), especially reinforcement learning, is envisioned with the potential to develop more efficient optimization algorithms. Motivated by innovations in blockchain, smart contract, and Ai, this article proposes a decentralized federated slicing architecture that is trustful and efficient. We systematically discuss the design principles and key challenges in realizing the blockchain-enabled architecture. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture for multiple operators and cloud providers, with a new proof of business consensus protocol to ensure incentive and fairness. To further enhance its efficiency, we utilize reinforcement learning to accelerate optimizations in the resource allocation. Benefits of the AI accelerated optimizer are demonstrated in simulations. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,"Blockchain; Computer architecture; Network architecture; Queueing networks; Reinforcement learning; Consensus protocols; Design Principles; General architectures; Master-slave architecture; Multiple operator; Multiple services; Optimization algorithms; Research communities; 5G mobile communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097346000

Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools. Objective: This paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist. Methods: A systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering. Results: The review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits. Conclusions: The research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This growth will be reflected in the demand for better services that should be adjusted to the collective and individual needs of the population. Governments and organizations are working on defining and implementing strategies that will enable them to respond to these challenges. The main challenges are related to transport and its management, considering transportation as a core issue in the economy, sustainability, and development of the regions. In this way, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play a key role in the response to these scenarios, being that they are the framework where the new hardware and software tools are integrated, allowing an efficient development of transportation systems management, attending to aspects such as: traffic management, communications between vehicles and infrastructures, and security, among others. Nevertheless, the concept of ITS evolves rapidly so it is necessary to understand its evolution. To do that, the current research develops a thematic analysis of ITS in literature, evaluating the intellectual structure and its evolution using SciMAT, quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, and identifying the main research areas, authors, journals, and countries. To this purpose, the publications related to ITS from 1993 to 2019 available in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection were retrieved (7649 publications) and analyzed. Finally, one of the main results is the latest research themes map of ITS, considering its intellectual structure, evolution, and relationship. It assists in the definition and implementation of strategies, the identification of the scientific, academic, and business opportunities, and future research lines to consolidate the role of ITS in the new city models. © 2020 by the authors.

However, these offerings seldom enhance revenue, because companies struggle with business model (BM) dynamics. By analyzing 27 companies through an explorative case-study approach, the authors consider how companies can successfully achieve revenue enhancement through digital offerings. The result is a threefold framework for revenue enhancement through digital offerings. First, this framework distinguishes between three phases of BM dynamics: 1) augmenting products through a “hardware plus” logic, 2) developing a portfolio of multiple logics for creating customer value, 3) integrating this portfolio through platform logic. Second, the framework emphasizes that three barriers, which we refer to as confidence, mixing, and collaboration barrier, limit the progress from Phases 1 to 3. Third, the framework reveals that each phase contains certain modifications of BM components. In the first phase, companies adapt their BM components slightly, so as to advance toward a “hardware plus” logic. In the second phase, companies embrace more radical BM innovations in order to convert services into an outcome-based BM and develop a new software subscription BM. In the third phase, companies modify BM components in order to integrate the BMs internally and to open them up for external collaboration partners. © 2020","Business model components; Business model innovations; Business models; Competitive advantages; Digital offerings; Digitalization; Revenue enhancement; Value creation",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094190922

As such, firms use AI to achieve deep market engagement when the firm's data are employed to make informed decisions. This study examines the role of computer-mediated AI agents in detecting crises related to events in a firm. A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management. The study extends the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) and Attribution theory frameworks built on big data and machine learning capabilities for early detection of crises in the market. This research proposes a structural model composed of a statistical and sentimental big data analytics approach. The findings of our empirical research suggest that knowledge extracted from day-to-day data communications such as email communications of a firm can lead to the sensing of critical events related to business activities. To test our model, we use a publicly available dataset containing 517,401 items belonging to 150 users, mostly senior managers of Enron during 1999 through the 2001 crisis. The findings suggest that the model is plausible in the early detection of Enron's critical events, which can support decision making in the market. © 2020","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data mining; Machine learning; Sentiment analytics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092103127

In probabilistic causal models capable of representing unpredictable and novel events, probabilities for what will happen, and even what is possible, cannot necessarily be determined in advance. Standard decision and risk analysis questions become inherently unanswerable (“undecidable”) for realistically complex causal systems with “open-world” uncertainties about what exists, what can happen, what other agents know, and how they will act. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques enable agents (e.g., robots, drone swarms, and automatic controllers) to learn, plan, and act effectively despite open-world uncertainties in a host of practical applications, from robotics and autonomous vehicles to industrial engineering, transportation and logistics automation, and industrial process control. This article offers an AI/machine learning perspective on recent ideas for making decision and risk analysis (even) more useful. It reviews undecidability results and recent principles and methods for enabling intelligent agents to learn what works and how to complete useful tasks, adjust plans as needed, and achieve multiple goals safely and reasonably efficiently when possible, despite open-world uncertainties and unpredictable events. In the near future, these principles could contribute to the formulation and effective implementation of more effective plans and policies in business, regulation, and public policy, as well as in engineering, disaster management, and military and civil defense operations. They can extend traditional decision and risk analysis to deal more successfully with open-world novelty and unpredictable events in large-scale real-world planning, policymaking, and risk management. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis","Decision analysis; risk analysis","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Intelligent agents; Intelligent robots; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Automatic controllers; Defense operations; Disaster management; Expected utility; Industrial process control; Making decision; Real-world planning; Undecidability; Risk analysis; artificial intelligence; decision making; machine learning; management practice; planning process; policy making; probability; risk assessment; robotics; army; article; artificial intelligence; causal model; civil defense; disaster; machine learning; probability; process control; public policy; risk assessment; risk management; robotics; uncertainty; unmanned aerial vehicle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091725899

However, it remains increasingly difficult for mining companies to decide which digital technologies are most relevant to their needs and individual mines. This paper provides an overview of digital technologies currently relevant to mining companies as presented and discussed by mining journals, the media and insight reports of leading consultancy agencies. Relevant technologies were systematically identified using text-mining techniques, and network analyses established the relations between significant technologies. Results demonstrated that currently 107 different digital technologies are pursued in the mining sector. Also, an analysis of the actual implementation of digital technologies in 158 active surface and underground mines reveals a limited uptake of digital technologies in general and that the uptake increases with the run-of-mine production. Large-scale mining operations appear to select and apply digital technologies suitable to their needs, whereas operations with lower production rates do not implement the currently available digital technologies to the same extent. These minor producers may require other digital transformation solutions tailored to their capabilities and needs and applicable to their scale of operations. © 2020","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Big data; Diffusion of digital technologies; Internet of things; Machine learning","Text mining; Business productivity; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Large-scale mining; Mining companies; Production rates; Text mining techniques; Underground mine; Digital devices",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088800481

Legacy software is vital to many organizations as it contains the important business logic. To facilitate maintenance of legacy software, a comprehensive understanding of the software’s behavior is essential. In terms of component-based software engineering, it is necessary to completely understand the behavior of components in relation to their interfaces, i.e., their interface protocols, and to preserve this behavior during the maintenance activities of the components. For this purpose, we present an approach to infer the interface protocols of software components from the behavioral models of those components, learned by a blackbox technique called active (automata) learning. To validate the learned results, we applied our approach to the software components developed with model-based engineering so that equivalence can be checked between the learned models and the reference models, ensuring the behavioral relations are preserved. Experimenting with components having reference models and performing equivalence checking builds confidence that applying active learning technique to reverse engineer legacy software components, for which no reference models are available, will also yield correct results. To apply our approach in practice, we present an automated framework for conducting active learning on a large set of components and deriving their interface protocols. Using the framework, we validated our methodology by applying active learning on 202 industrial software components, out of which, interface protocols could be successfully derived for 156 components within our given time bound of 1 h for each component. © 2020, The Author(s).","Active automata learning; Equivalence oracles; Interface protocols; Learning framework","Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Legacy systems; Component-based software engineering; Equivalence checking; High tech companies; Industrial software; Interface protocol; Maintenance activity; Model-based engineering; Software component; Computer software maintenance",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087287848

The resale market itself changes with the influx of new products, as well as hardware and software discontinuations. Competitive business decision making is often performed by a human operator and may not be timely or fully informed. These are decisions such as whether to perform a high cost repair or recycle a product or whether to use a batch of parts in repair or sell them on. These decisions can be used to optimise product life-cycle management (PLM) and profit margins. A real-time decision making capability can reduce the risk of performing non-profitable processing. The novel contribution of this work is an interoperable semantic decision support toolset that enables a capability for timely EoL decisions based on complete knowledge on profitability, predicted pricing and cost-of-production. Many decision support systems have been proposed for the EoL domain, but a lack of interoperability and use of unstructured knowledge bases has led to decisions based on knowledge that is not up to date.

As most of the vegetable production, tomato require significant amount of agronomic inputs. However, recent shifts in climate patterns in terms of timing and amount in rainfall, patterns in air temperature, and the associated extreme events have caused harm and disruption to the agricultural sector worldwide. The objective of this study was to: i) evaluate the ability of a crop simulation model to simulate yield and growth parameter of a processing tomato in South west Italy; ii) quantify the impacts of projected climate on business as usual agronomic practices; iii) understand the role of projected changes and increased CO2 on the water and nutrient efficiency. Field trials from an open field at Sele Valley (40°35′03.8″ N, 14°58′48.6″ E) (Salerno, South west Italy) during a two-year period (2004–2005) were used. Baseline climate data (1984–2018) were available and four contrasting projections were selected as function of their spread in terms of changes in growing season rainfall and temperature respect to the baseline. The crop model DSSAT (Decision Support System of Agrotechnology Transfer) was used for this study. The model was able to simulate tomato response to N fertilization with acceptable error levels respect to the ones reported in literature. The projected increase in air temperature and changes in rainfall caused a shortening ranging from 1.5 to 3 days in tomato phenology causing an overall 15 % reduction in tomato yield.

This has led to calls for concerted efforts to shift from the linear economy to a circular economy (CE), which are gaining momentum globally. CE approaches lead to a zero-waste scenario of economic growth and sustainable development. These approaches are based on semi-scientific and empirical concepts with technologies enabling 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and 6Rs (reuse, recycle, redesign, remanufacture, reduce, recover). Studies estimate that the transition to a CE would save the world in excess of a trillion dollars annually while creating new jobs, business opportunities and economic growth. The emerging industrial revolution will enhance the symbiotic pursuit of new technologies and CE to transform extant production systems and business models for sustainability. This article examines the trends, availability and readiness of fourth industrial revolution (4IR or industry 4.0) technologies (for example, Internet of Things [IoT], artificial intelligence [AI] and nanotechnology) to support and promote CE transitions within the higher education institutional context. Furthermore, it elucidates the role of universities as living laboratories for experimenting the utility of industry 4.0 technologies in driving the shift towards CE futures. The article concludes that universities should play a pivotal role in engendering CE transitions. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","circular economy; higher education; Industry 4.0 technologies; innovation","economic growth; higher education; innovation; regional development; sustainable development; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085375157

Meanwhile, omni-channel related operations impose a challenge on either well-established firms or new setups that they have to make “right” decisions to fit in the new retail environment. This review paper endeavors to reveal the established knowledge behind the omni-channel retailing literature, generate managerial implications for firms, and provides a guideline for future research. We conduct this systematic review by adopting citation network analysis (CNA). The CNA helps identify seven independent and interdependent research domains, which depict (or constitute) a whole picture of “omnichannel management”. The main path analysis reveals that each identified research domain is under study. We also find that the extant literature seldom examines the roles of how new technologies play in the “omnichannel management”. Moreover, the domain of supply chain management and inventory management in the omnichannel environment is absent in this systematic literature review. Therefore, we propose a prescribed framework for “omnichannel management” (PFOM), which contributes to the literature on “omnichannel management” and provides important managerial applications to the retail firms that plan to implement the omnichannel strategy. © 2020","Omni-channel management; Omni-channel retailing; Omni-channel strategy; Review","Augmented reality; Inventory control; Managers; Metadata; Regression analysis; Reviews; Supply chain management; Channel management; Channel strategies; Emerging technologies; Inventory management; Main path analysis; Managerial implications; Omni-channel retailing; Systematic literature review; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082773227

AI, an emerging technology that aims to mimic the cognitive skills and judgment of humans, promises competitive advantages to the adopter. As a result, all the Big 4 firms are reporting its use and their plans to continue with this innovation in areas such as audit planning risk assessments, tests of transactions, analytics, and the preparation of audit work-papers, among other uses. As the uses and benefits of AI continue to emerge within the auditing profession, there is a gradual awakening to the fact that unintended consequences may also arise. Thus, we heed to the call of numerous researchers to not only explore the benefits of AI but also investigate the ethical implications of the use of this emerging technology. By combining two futuristic ethical frameworks, we forecast the ethical implications of the use of AI in auditing, given its inherent features, nature, and intended functions. We provide a conceptual analysis of the practical ethical and social issues surrounding AI, using past studies as well as our inferences based on the reported use of the technology by auditing firms.

Yet, firms did not become per se more productive, as labor productivity growth in various industrial nations has decelerated in recent years. The fact that the adoption of innovative technologies is not accompanied by productivity increases has already been observed during the dawn of the computer age and became known as Solow’s Paradox. Thus, this paper takes stock of what is known about the Solow Paradox, before incorporating the findings into the debate of the current productivity slowdown. Based on an in-depth review of 86 empirical studies at the firm level, this paper uncovers various reasons for the emergence of the Solow Paradox, debates its following reversal marked by the occurrence of excess returns and deduces a model of factors influencing the returns on IT investments. Based on these insights, four overarching explanations of the modern productivity paradox namely adjustment delays, measurement issues, exaggerated expectations and mismanagement are discussed, whereby mismanagement emerges as a currently neglected, but focal issue. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Industry 4.0; Information technology; IT investment; IT productivity paradox; Productivity; Solow Paradox",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074499789

These complexities are compounded by fast moving technologies, such as the increased usage of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT). These new technologies have a social impact, but it is how these impacts are developed and managed by people and companies that is significant. Similarly, it is important to investigate how the uncertainties and intangible factors are dealt with and how businesses can utilize innovative approaches to become adaptive in emerging market economies. Research is needed to determine how actors or businesses interact to shape and define either new institutions, new industries, or new innovation to meet the need of potential customers in emerging economies. Innovation Management and Growth in Emerging Economies explores how innovation from emerging economies is being developed through strategic choices and presents the benefits and the drawbacks, the processes, and the characteristics and management practices of both private and/or public organizations. The chapters identify the trends and approaches to innovation development as well as the strategies of adapting and converting threats and challenges into opportunities.

The interaction with these technologies not only provides the immediate supply of any virtual content but increases the possibilities of personalization through artificial intelligence (AI). AI in all of its developments, is advancing faster than the capacity of institutions and organizations to provide legal and deontological responses. Finding solutions to its implications in new ecosystems where technology learns from human routines and interacts with users is a challenge that must be addressed from the academic, political and business fields. Technology advances show that algorithms and automatization have become omnipresent in contemporary times, increasingly determining the nature of the contents that reach the users. This work offers an interpretative descriptive framework based on two main objectives: firstly, describing the evolution of voice assistants as tools for the automated personalization of information contents - about which each individual becomes aware of his environment and makes decisions; and secondly, highlighting the ethical demands on AI when personalizing contents in voice interfaces.

The authors argue that the application of relevant AI technology could help address this challenge. Employing interactively prompted narrative storytelling, and the authors investigate the effectiveness of sentiment analysis (SA) on extracting valuable CE insights from primary qualitative data generated via chatbot interviews. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a granular and semantically clear framework for studying CE feelings, an artificial intelligence (AI) augmented chatbot was designed. The chatbot interviewed a crowdsourced sample of consumers about their recalled service experience feelings. By combining free-text and closed-ended questions, the authors were able to compare extracted sentiment polarities against established measurement scales and empirically validate our novel approach. Findings: The authors demonstrate that SA can effectively extract CE feelings from primary chatbot data. This findings also suggest that further enhancement in accuracy can be achieved via improvements in the interplay between the chatbot interviewer and SA extraction algorithms. Research limitations/implications: The proposed customer-centric approach can help service companies to study and better understand CE feelings in a cost-effective and scalable manner. The AI-augmented chatbots can also help companies to foster immersive and engaging relationships with customers. This study focuses on feelings, warranting further research on AI's value in studying other CE elements. Originality/value: The unique inquisitive role of AI-infused chatbots in conducting interviews and analyzing data in realtime, offers considerable potential for studying CE and other subjective constructs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Customer experience; Customer feelings; Sentiment analysis; Storytelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088694442

As known, the utilization of AI technology is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily life. Furthermore, discussion related to AI has played an essential role in an organization's decision-making process. Thus, this paper discusses the utilization of AI technology that penetrates end-To-end various aspects of human activities, such as in education, health, business, social life and so forth. The end-To-end process begins with data collection covering various types of data (text, picture, audio, video, animation) and various methods (survey, observation, interview, experiment). Then, it continues with the pre-process data cleansing and process to determine data features, and seeks the relationship within them, using machine learning process with appropriate algorithms. The results may then be used for applications portfolio in order to improve organization strategies and programs. The organization's performance can be visualized from time to time for continuous quality improvement. The end-To-end cycles of processes continue, from data collection, data pre-processing and processing, performance computation monitoring (identification, classification, prediction, and prescription), improving strategy and program, and implementing in the real-life activities until generating more behavioral data, finding pattern and design the systems. As a whole, this end-To-end cycle leads us to an AI automation system, with the power to generate meaningful insights suited to solve current problems, predicting trending issues, and understanding phenomena. © 2020 IEEE.","AI; artificial intelligence; automation system; big data; deep learning; end-To-end cycle processes; finding pattern; ICT; machine learning","Application programs; Automation; Big data; Decision making; Enterprise resource planning; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Security of data; Artificial intelligence research; Automation systems; Continuous quality improvement; Data preprocessing; Decision making process; End-to-end process; Information and Communication Technologies; Performance computation; Data acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097632062

However, these chat platforms can overwhelm the users with unstructured long streams of back and forth discussions scattered in various places. Thus, discussions become challenging to follow, leading to an increased likelihood of missing valuable information. Moreover, with the unsatisfying keyword-based chat search, users spend a significant amount of time to read, digest, and recall information from the conversations at the cost of productivity.

AI has already been incorporated in many industries to improve business processes and automation. Although the aviation industry has successfully implemented flight management systems or autopilot to automate flight operations, it is expected that full embracement of AI remains a challenge. Given the rigorous validation process and the requirements for the highest level of safety standards and risk management, AI needs to prove itself being safe to operate. This paper addresses the safety issues of AI deployment in an aviation network compatible with the Future Communication Infrastructure that utilizes heterogeneous wireless access technologies for communications between the aircraft and the ground networks. It further considers the exploitation of software defined networking (SDN) technologies in the ground network while the adoption of SDN in the airborne network can be optional. Due to the nature of centralized management in SDN-based network, the SDN controller can become a single point of failure or a target for cyber attacks. To countermeasure such attacks, an intrusion detection system utilises AI techniques, more specifically deep neural network (DNN), is considered. However, an adversary can target the AI-based intrusion detection system. This paper examines the impact of AI security attacks on the performance of the DNN algorithm. Poisoning attacks targeting the DSL-KDD datasets which were used to train the DNN algorithm were launched at the intrusion detection system. Results showed that the performance of the DNN algorithm has been significantly degraded in terms of the mean square error, accuracy rate, precision rate and the recall rate. © 2020 IEEE.","AI security; Deep Neural Network; Heterogeneous wireless access technologies; Intrusion detection; SDN","Aircraft communication; Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Digital avionics; Intrusion detection; Mean square error; Modems; Network security; Risk management; Safety engineering; Centralized management; Communication infrastructure; Flight management systems; Intrusion Detection Systems; Rigorous validation; Software defined networking (SDN); Wireless access technology; Wireless communications networks; Computer crime",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097983090

The queue-length and the waiting time is often overestimated when some customer abandons from the queue. The overestimated waiting time intensify the customer abandonment problem which has negatively effects on business revenue and the resource utilization. Based on the problem, this paper aims to study the adaptive queue management system with the queue reservation system and also proposed the time restriction rule for the reservation. In the system the queue information such as queue-length and service time is constantly updated by Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), and the system is allowed customer to reserve the queue if the waiting time is too long. Moreover, the time restriction rule prevents the reservation which affects the system performance. The result shows that the adaptive queue management system with the queue reservation and the time restriction rule outperforms the system without the time restriction rule. In most cases, the resource utilization of the system is 0.9, and the percentage of customer completed service is improved by the time restriction rule. © 2020 ACM.","Adaptive Queue Management System; Artificial Neural Network; Exponential Weight Moving Average Control Chart; Queue Reservation System","Artificial intelligence; Queueing theory; Reservation systems; Sales; Adaptive queue management; Queue information; Queue lengths; Queuing systems; Resource utilizations; Service time; System utilization; Time restriction; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101173677

Considering the effect of major environmental events such as the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, technology has become even more influential. In this context, the very rapid developments in technologies such as cloud computing, internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence and 5G and consequently the need for continuous upskilling of expert human resources have made the adaptation of traditional learning and teaching methods to this new human condition a vital issue. While the aforementioned phenomenon is being experienced, a talent gap is observed between the competencies of the graduates of Computer Science Engineering, Software Engineering, Industrial Engineering and other related departments and industry expectations as a result of the traditional education approaches of the universities. The shortening of the lifespan of the produced vocational knowledge day by day continues to increase this gap. For this reason, it has become more important than ever that higher education institutions have an approach that is more suitable for this dynamic environment. In this study, it has been examined whether the agile methods, which have become widespread within software industry in the last 15 years, have similar potential when used as a training method. During the study, 49 students from the engineering faculty of a Turkish University participated in the ""Agile Software and Product Development""course. The curriculum design, learning experiences, student performance considerations and the other results have been shared. In this course, 3 Sprints are designed with 8 Agile Project Teams that are self-organized with the Scrum framework. Continuous team learning opportunities were evaluated and the difficulties encountered in applying ""agility""approach to students while developing innovative ideas and the effect of agile method on the performance of learning were examined.

For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future. Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics. In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual educational tool to teach data science to high school students.

Apart from the technologies, the key factor of a successful digital enterprise is people. It is human capital that acts as the main resource when forming a business model based on data. Conventional IT models can no longer meet the growing digital necessities of business. Big data analytics departs from IT divisions and ceases to be a prerogative of CIO.

The working hypothesis is that against the background of low economic growth in Russia and high competition among state and quasi-state banks, small and medium-sized banks can remain competitive only through cooperation and the introduction of new advanced technologies (artificial intelligence technology and blockchain technology). The article provides a brief overview of theoretical and empirical studies of the introduction of modern information technologies in banking. Briefly describes the international experience in implementing information technology in the financial sector of the economy. The article also provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the development of the modern Russian banking system. The analysis of official statistics of the Bank of Russia was carried out, which confirmed the tendency to decrease in the number of banks in the Russian economy, as well as the increase in the degree of monopolization of the banking sector of the Russian economy. Together, these two phenomena lead to increased competition between large banks on the one hand and medium and small banks on the other, in which the latter can only be actively introduced by new information technologies. The study clearly showed that the monopolization of the banking sector leads to the need to look for new development paths for small and medium-sized banks through the introduction of modern technologies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094212523

This paper discusses one of the new technologies known as the Internet of Things (IoT) which has, along with other technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, ""Big data"", a unique potential that can cause significant changes in the world. IoT allows businesses to use innovative services more quickly, with less risk. Russia goes behind European countries in the development of the logistics industry, which shows the necessity for innovative methods of management and control of delivery flows. Due the problems in the development of informatization of the logistics sector in Russia and the global trend of transition to a digital economy, the authors considered it relevant to study foreign experience. The Internet of Things guarantees a massive revolution in logistics over the next decade. This creates new business benefits by minimizing the price of device components, increasing the speed of wireless networks, and expanding the ability to receive data on the network. Work focuses on the implementation of IoT in logistics, real-world examples of the use among transport companies and perspectives for the development of new technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094179977

The role and importance of artificial intelligence in modern business. The directions in which artificial intelligence and machine learning are developing are considered. The article notes the difficult moments associated with the creation of conditions (legislative framework, infrastructure, motivation of entrepreneurs, etc.) for the introduction of artificial intelligence in business. The article presents an assessment of the results of the introduction of artificial intelligence in the global and domestic business. Since technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are important for the modern world, are attracting increasing attention, the article discusses the introduction of artificial intelligence in such a dynamic industry as the transportation industry. Considering the practice acquired by Western companies in the field of innovation and digitalization, it is possible to predict the possibility of using artificial intelligence by Russian companies in those industries where it is difficult to compete without the introduction of robotics. To enhance the process of creating and implementing artificial intelligence in Russian business, it is important to know and be able to evaluate the problems that hinder the development of new technological solutions.

The Digital Railway is in a large extend linked with the knowledge-based economy, knowledge management and knowledge management technologies which have had a significant impact on digital transformations in the industry and professional education. An ontology characterized the cause-effect and aggregative relations reflecting transformation chains in the various spheres of human activity and shedding light on the Digital Railway place in the context of digital economy is presented. The article argues that the Digital Railway role in changing mechanisms of interaction between industry and universities, which are also specialized research centres with closer ties to the industry, is best understood applying to the idea of ""a smart contract""that can be reduced to artificial intelligent agents serving as intermediaries providing interaction between the non-human and human roles in a business process. With the smart contract technology, the Digital Railway might provide a precedent in development of the Hybrid Corporate Intelligence based on industry-related knowledge redistributed between artificial intelligent agents and employees. From this perspective, the process of corporate informatization is seen through a system of artificial intelligent agents implying the formalization of operational rules and regulations into a shared knowledge base in a form of ontologies. The proposed idea can be transferred to universities where smart contracts may support professional training as a business process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094127897

We envision a smart community (SC) as an inter-connected ecosystem ranging from a small region to a global scale enabled by IoT devices and key technologies for the betterment of its citizens, businesses, and organizations. A critical aspect for enabling such future smart communities is developing a secure and privacy-preserving access control (AC) framework to defend against malicious actors in the system. Traditionally, access control principles have been formulated based on the access control requirements of an enterprise, an application or a system. Smart communities are an evolving and dynamic concept that includes a range of interdisciplinary components. Thus it is appropriate to reevaluate current access control principles for such a diverse and dynamic ecosystem. In this paper, we first discuss access control requirements and then present access control principles for future smart communities. We envision a convergent access control approach towards enabling future smart communities where different access control models synergistically converge at both policy and enforcement layers. Therefore, we propose a Convergent Access Control (CAC) framework that can address the access control requirements of dynamic application domains such as in future smart communities.

Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, nongovernmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas.

Using these technologies, enterprises and organizations implement new business models and capabilities. In the beginning, AI-technologies have been deployed in an experimental environment. AI-based applications have been created in an ad-hoc manner and without methodological guidance or engineering approach. Due to the increasing importance of AI-technologies, however, a more structured approach is necessary that enable the methodological engineering of AI-based applications. Therefore, we develop in this paper first steps towards methodological engineering of AI-based applications. First, we identify some important differences between the technological foundations of AI- technologies, in particular deep learning, and traditional information technologies. Then we create a framework that enables to engineer AI-applications using four steps: identification of an AI-application type, sub-type identification, lifecycle phase, and definition of details. The introduced framework considers that AI-applications use an inductive approach to infer knowledge from huge collections and streams of data. It not only enables the rapid development of AI-application but also the efficient sharing of knowledge on AI-applications. © 2020 IEEE.","Application Development; Artificial Intelligence; Design Science; Framework","Air navigation; Data streams; Deep learning; Life cycle; AI applications; AI Technologies; Experimental environment; New business models; Structured approach; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096132955

To achieve this, an empirical survey was conducted with 189 key managers in 50 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have established smart factories with government aid, and the responses were analyzed with a structural equation model using the AMOS program. The research findings show that these success factors were only partially effective—they had a positive effect on the continuous use of smart factories by SMEs, as well as the factories’ productivity and quality performance (sub-factors of business performance), but had no significant effect on financial performance. This means that the effective utilization of these factors can enable high-quality performance by maintaining operational efficiency. Consequently, the integration and utilization of IoT, big data, AI, 5G, and MES based on AI technologies have policy and practical implications, showing that they should be used as key success factors in SMEs. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Business Performance; Key Success Factors; Korea; Medium Enterprises; Small; Smart Factory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094667746

Nowadays, datasets collected from shop floor assets and information technology (IT) systems are used in data-driven analytics efforts to support more informed business intelligence decisions. However, these results are currently only used in isolated and dispersed parts of the production process. At the same time, full integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in all parts of manufacturing systems is currently lacking. In this context, the goal of this manuscript is to present a more holistic integration of AI by promoting collaboration. To this end, collaboration is understood as a multi-dimensional conceptual term that covers all important enablers for AI adoption in manufacturing contexts and is promoted in terms of business intelligence optimization, human-in-the-loop and secure federation across manufacturing sites. To address these challenges, the proposed architectural approach builds on three technical pillars: (1) components that extend the functionality of the existing layers in the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0; (2) definition of new layers for collaboration by means of human-in-the-loop and federation; (3) security concerns with AI-powered mechanisms.

A case in point are logistics processes which are characterized by very limited visibility and inefficient organization. To progress beyond this current state of the art, we conceptualize the idea of a lightweight digital twin for non-high-tech industries. In collaboration with a leading supplier of building materials, we explore the opportunities offered by digital silo twin capabilities. Focusing on fill level monitoring we identify diverse opportunities for generating informational, automational and transformational business value. Leveraging new information sources for the redesign of core business processes drastically increases the complexity of operational decision-making. To tap into these opportunities, we design and implement a decision support system for silo dispatch and replenishment activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Construction industry; Decision support system; Digital twin; Smart logistics; Supply chain management","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Digital twin; Building activities; Construction sites; Design and implements; Digital transformation; High tech industry; Information sources; Limited visibility; Operational decision making; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087681639

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); business models; cyber physical systems (CPSs); digital twin (DT); Internet of Things (IoT); machine learning (ML); multiagent systems; network function virtualization; sensors; servitization; smart city; software architecture; softwarization; virtual and augmented reality","Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Surveys; Application contexts; Application scenario; Architectural modeling; Architectural models; Augmented and virtual realities; Essential characteristic; Manufacturing industries; Software architecture model; Digital twin",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087488936

This may fundamentally change the way we live, work, and relate to one another. Embracing data and digital information is a top priority for most industries these days, and Life Sciences is no exception. The pharmaceutical industry in particular is fundamentally a data-driven business. Inspired by a desire to “Go Big on Data,” we developed a strategic roadmap defining a digital transformation to reimagine the way we work in Novartis Global Drug Development, leveraging data science to generate and inject actionable insights into our best practices. We launched a program called Nerve Live, and built a state-of-the-art data and analytics platform to harness past and present operational data, providing access to decades of drug development “experience” buried across multiple sources. The platform enabled the systematic application of machine learning and predictive analytics to generate “intelligence”: new insights across multiple functional areas. To action the insights and create “value,” we crafted skillfully designed end-user applications for domain experts to plan, track, predict, compare and monitor domain activities, optimize costs, and maximize quality. Today, the Nerve Live program enables insights-driven decision making at scale, unlocking productivity, and providing transparency across the Novartis Global Drug Development organization and beyond. We identified three main drivers making the Nerve Live program successful and enabling the associated digital transformation to flourish. We discuss the challenges, highlight the benefits, and see the importance of leading the way to become future proof. © 2020 The Authors.

In order to improve the operational accuracy of risk measures and incorporate customer behavior analytics, we propose a Bayesian approach to efficiently estimate the multivariate risk measures in a dynamic framework. The proposed method can carry the prior information into the Bayesian analysis and fully describe the risk measures’ behavior after utilizing the Cornish–Fisher (CF) approximation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Therefore, the operating systems and processes of risk management can be well performed either based on the first four conditional moments of the underlying model employed to consider some specific behavioral features (e.g., the time-varying conditional multivariate skewness) or the characteristics extracted from the big data. We conduct a simulation study to distinguish the applications of CF approximation and MCMC sampling after comparing them with the classic likelihood based method. We then provide a robust procedure for empirical investigation by using the real data of U.S. DJIA stocks. Both simulation and empirical results confirm that the Bayesian method can significantly improve the operations of risk management. © 2020","Bayesian method; Big data; Business analytics; Decision support system; Financial services; Risk management","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Big data; Decision support systems; Finance; Information management; Markov chains; Monte Carlo methods; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Bayesian methods; Behavioral features; Business analytics; Conditional moments; Empirical investigation; Financial service; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Systems and process; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082173001

Apart from infrastructure-related means such as traffic lights, planned and unplanned road events and different road networks, a core component which contributes towards the traffic environment is the human factor which is heavily overlooked in the current studies. Due to diverse travel patterns of day-to-day activities, the commuter behaviour is directly depicted in traffic patterns providing an opportunity to further explore human behaviours using road traffic. Conducting such analysis would reveal different commuter behavioural patterns that can be used for optimization and timely management of operations. However, to conduct such real-time behaviour analysis, large volumes of high-frequency data are required with high granularity, as well as, a suitable technology to manage such data. Addressing these needs, we propose an environment-driven commuter behavioural model that can be used to elucidate diverse behaviours in road traffic environments. We conceptualized, designed and developed an artificial intelligence based commuter behaviour profiling framework to detect diverse commuter behavioural profiles, fluctuating and routine patterns among commuters using traffic flow profiling and travel trajectory analysis. We evaluated the framework using 190 million data points captured from the Bluetooth sensor network of the Melbourne arterial road network, in the state of Victoria in Australia. The results demonstrate that traffic flow profiling of the proposed framework can provide insights on recurrent commuter behaviours that are distinct to a selected area with a high granularity. Moreover, traffic trajectory analysis provides insights on non-recurrent behaviours such as accidents with regard to how such incidents impact the dynamics of the network and how the impact is propagated through the network. Besides road traffic management, the proposed framework will enable real-time decision-making when planning road infrastructure and support decision-making of government and business entities to optimize operations. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Bluetooth data; Flow profiling; Human behaviour; IoT; Traffic analysis; Trajectory analysis","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Bluetooth; Highway administration; Highway planning; Internet of things; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Sensor networks; Street traffic control; Trajectories; Environmental factors; Flow profiling; Human behaviours; Real time decision-making; Road traffic environments; Road traffic management; Traffic analysis; Trajectory analysis; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079806281

IoT devices generate massive structured or unstructured data including text data. The opportunity coming behind big data and unstructured data is a great impulse for governments or companies to choose solutions based on text mining approaches to improve strategic business activities and boost decision making. Expert information is an important reference information for decision making. How to collect the expert information from text or web documents is a problem. In this paper, a text mining approach is introduced to crawl and extract expert information from Internet. We build a basic framework and main modules including information extraction, data cleaning and deduplication, expert recommendation model to cope with text data from Web content. We also define several metrics, data structures and propose some algorithms to help text mining. Finally, the experiment is implemented with datasets and the results show that our text mining approach can extract expert attributes accurately. © 2019","Big data; Expert database; Information extraction; Text mining","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Decision making; Information retrieval; Intelligent databases; Websites; Data cleaning; De duplications; Expert informations; Expert recommendations; High quality information; Strategic business; Text mining; Unstructured data; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075342888

Therefore, the replacement of traditional linear business models involving product discard at the end of product life with concepts focusing on re-use of resources is essential. Reverse Logistics and Closed-loop Supply Chains are seen to be key elements of such a transition. Motivated by findings from a case study of an independent reprocessing company, we address integrated decision-making in Reverse Logistics in this paper. We present a non-linear optimisation model with interrelated processes in terms of acquisition of used products, grading for determination of product quality and reprocessing disposition. The decisions to be made concern the effort spent for active acquisition of used products and the number of reprocessed goods; both decisions are influenced by heterogeneous condition of used products. The consideration of deterministic and stochastic demand facilitates the representation of a variety of business cases. For both demand types we provide analytical insights in the form of complete strategies consisting of different scenarios which allow optimal decision-making under variable conditions. Numerical examples complement insights into the model by conducting a sensitivity analysis of relevant model parameters. © 2019 The Author(s).

Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the ""Internet of Business-Education"". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain). This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a ""crowd-sourced purchase order from the future""precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency.

Using nearest neighbor index and kernel density analysis, this study took Starbucks and Luckin Coffee of Shanghai in 2018 as examples to examine the difference in spatial patterns between traditional retail and new retail. Spatial regression models were used to explore the differences in the factors affecting location choice between new retail and traditional retail. The main conclusions are that: 1) The location strategy of Luckin Coffee and Starbucks stores follows Christaller's central place model at the city level, but there are also differences between them. As a representative of the new retail industry, Luckin Coffee is more homogeneous in the urban circles. It does not place as much emphasis as Starbucks does on the central location of the city. 2) Overall, traditional retail and new retail have both similar and dissimilar characteristics on aggregation degree. The aggregation degree of Luckin Coffee is higher than Starbucks. In the central area of the city, traditional retail presents a single- central agglomerated feature, while new retail has a multi- centered dispersal feature. The aggregation degree of Luckin Coffee is lower than Starbucks. 3) There exists a major difference in the location of new retail and traditional retail—with a commercial center preference, the traditional retail Starbucks has a highly significant correlation with the density of shopping malls; but the most important factor affecting the location of Luckin Coffee is the density of office buildings. Rent has a negative impact, indicating that the new retail has a business office center preference. © 2020, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

We establish an analytical framework to examine these three models for addressing the platform's optimal business decision. Our results reveal that both the time-sensitive cost of heterogeneous passengers and the operating cost of the platform's self-operating vehicles play critical roles in the platform's choice of optimal model. If the operating cost of the platform's self-operating vehicles is relatively high, the platform should choose the pooling service model when passengers have a low ratio of time-sensitive cost between using the pooling service and using the premier service. The premier service model should be implemented if this ratio is in the middle range and the operating cost is sufficiently low. Otherwise, the hybrid service model is optimal. We characterize the conditions under which the pooling service model and the premier service model can achieve Pareto improvement for the platform and passengers. Furthermore, if the ratio is in the middle range, the pooling service model is more beneficial for passengers, while the premier service model is more profitable for the platform. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Business model; Pricing strategy; Ride-hailing platform; Sharing economy; Time-sensitive cost","Artificial intelligence; Knowledge based systems; Software engineering; Business decisions; Business modeling; Business models; Hybrid services; Optimal model; Pareto improvements; Service Model; Three models; Operating costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087961710

To compile documents that are consistent, complete and in accordance with standards, both from a technical and business perspective require enough knowledge. Some previous approaches, such as GUI-F framework, propose automated requirements specification document creation with a variety of different methods. However, most of them do not provide detailed guidance on how stakeholders can identify their needs to support the company's business needs. In addition, some methods only focus on documenting high level requirements specification, such as use case diagram. As for the code development process, this only represents very basic information and lack of technical aspects. In our previous work, we proposed a Rule-Based Ontology Framework (ROF) for Auto-Generating Requirements Specification. ROF covers 2 processes in requirements engineering, namely: elicitation and documentation. The output of the elicitation process is a list of final requirements that are stored in an ontology structure, called Requirements Ontology (RO). Using RO, the documentation process automatically generates 2 outputs: process model in the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard and Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents in the IEEE standard. The aim of this paper is to conduct a feasibility analysis to prove that ROF is feasible to be implemented in an Information System (IS) projects.

Today, in the VUCA world of disruptions, it is needless to say that the emergence of big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have facilitated the emergence of new pedagogies in learning like personalised learning and outcome- based approach to education. The prime focus of outcome-based education (OBE) is on the learning outcomes, which are expected to be attained at the completion of a course by a student rather than how they have attained the desired outcomes. The chapter seeks to provide an insight as to how the teaching learning processes and practices in business schools (management institutions) need to be further revamped to become outcome based to build the necessary skillsets and competencies in learners to increase their employability and develop an innovative and creative mindset in them to effectively meet the challenges of the workplace in future in the context of Industry 4.0.

Also, the vast spread of the theoretical notion of diverse businesses (like e-commerce) into the actual use has been recently applied by cloud computing. The service functionality could be affected by overfilling of the network traffic because of the broadly dispersed nature of e-commerce in clouds—a key challenge for immediate jobs. Throughout the last decade, a vast range of applications or large-scale operators has increasingly attracted to migrate the services in clouds. An effective method for accessing the applications throughout standard business hours is continually moving virtual machine containers from one data center to another. Now, with the commonness of cloud computing, many applications have been moved to the cloud fully/partly. It can be handled through the migration of cloud services to diverse platforms in a way that minimizes the communication cost of e-commerce. As this issue has an NP-hard nature, in the present article, we present an automatic smart service migration outline through the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm on cloud-oriented e-commerce. In the presented model, we use the ACO algorithm to take the finest (near-optimal) service migration decisions. Based on the obtained results, the proposed technique has the optimal number of migrations compared to the existing models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ant colony optimization algorithm; cloud computing; e-commerce; service migration","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Electronic commerce; Information services; Web services; ACO algorithms; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Communication cost; Network traffic; New approaches; Optimization algorithms; Service functionalities; Service migration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087315096

This paper aims to propose modern slavery due diligence process which leverages the self-sovereign digital identity component, an AI-based modern slavery offense monitoring component, and a modern slavery offense blockchain component designed to help improve the identification of modern slavery offenses which would otherwise remain hidden. This process enables managers to identify and act on more modern slavery offenses due to low-cost continuous monitoring instead of high-cost sample-based monitoring.

Every actor holds its own set of information and attempts to maximize its objective (minimizing costs/minimizing inventory holdings) based on the available settings. Therefore, the agents control their own activities with the objective of improving their own competitiveness, which leads them to make decisions that maximize their local performance by ignoring the other agents or even the final consumer. These decisions are myopic because they do not consider the performance of all the partners to satisfy the consumer.

The steady development of UAS has created a dynamic environment moving at faster pace than manned aviation. In particular, there is an intense pressure on operations in very low altitudes where market is driven by new business models. Commercial UAS operators are expected to monitor weather, changes in airspace structure, avoid buildings and temporary obstacles, consider potential risks arising from the ground, and maintain separation from manned aviation. On the other hand, authorities are expected to monitor, and control unmanned aerial traffic as well as enforce the airspace rules. To address this arising requirements unmanned traffic management is being developed and deployed in numerous countries, which aims to enable safe and efficient operations of highly automated UAS in automated unmanned traffic management (UTM) system developed on foundations of modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet-of-Things, 5G networks while considering the need to address cybersecurity requirements. Among cybersecurity requirements a potential candidate with promising applications is blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger of immutable records stored in a decentralized database.

The framework is developed based on thematic classification of the data collected by conducting the 31 semi-structured interviews with key people from the industry through 11 questions. We contend that shared vision and trust focussed on stakeholder view linked with common objective of the value chain can create a baseline to hit the target of SDGs around economic, ecological and societal benefits. The framework is useful for the working executives as it can act as reference plug to support and align the organizational activities towards SDGs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","modern information decision support systems; stakeholder theory; sustainability; Sustainable development goals","Artificial intelligence; Decision theory; Ecosystems; Planning; Sustainable development; Business organizations; Organizational activities; Semi structured interviews; Societal benefits; Stakeholder theory; Thematic classification; United Nations; World economy; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076416804

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted under the McKinsey’s Global Institute (Talwar and Koury, 2017) methodological perspective that identifies the four ways (i.e. project, produce, promote and provide) in which BDAI creates value. The authors enhanced this analysis methodology by depicting relevant challenges as well. Findings: The findings imply that BDAI create value for the tourism sector through appropriately identified disseminations. The benefits of adopting BDAI strategies include increased efficiency, productivity and profitability for tourism suppliers combined with an extremely rich and personalized experience for travellers. The authors conclude that challenges can be bypassed by adopting a BDAI strategy. Such an adoption will stand critical for the competitiveness and resilience of existing established and new players in the tourism sector. Originality/value: Besides identifying the benefits that BDAI brings in the tourism sector, the research proposes a guidebook to overcome challenges when introducing such new technologies. The exploration of the BDAI literature brings important implication for managers, academicians and consumers. This is the first systematic review in an area and contributes to the broader e-commerce marketing, retailing and e-tourism research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Business value; Literature review; Tourism",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085950979

However, data driven decisions generate better revenue. In this work, we present a methodology to create a Decision Support System (DSS) for Business to Business (B2B) sales that generates recommendations for actions to follow and actions to avoid to increase the chances of successfully closing a deal. At the core of our proposed DSS, is a three-step methodology relying on a particular approach of using belief rules. In the first step we generate, based on available data on previous won/lost deals, some forecasting models. As the best performing models are of black box type, the second step aims to extract if-then conventional rules that are converted, in the last step, into belief rules. Rather than using an attribute value probability matching to activate a belief rule, we propose a cost of activation that takes into account the current state of the active deal and the cost of transitioning the active deal's attributes into a new state that could activate a belief rule. Furthermore, we propose and analyze two methods of calculating the cost of transition related to the effort the sales representative should dispose to move the current deal into the new state.

Information and communication technology (ICT) systems have influenced every aspect of modern life and the CE is no exception. Cutting-edge technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain, can play an integral role in the embracing of CE concepts and the rollout of CE programs by governments, organizations, and society as a whole. The current paper conducts an extensive academic literature review on prominent ICT solutions paving the way towards a CE. For the categorization of the solutions, a novel two-fold approach is introduced, focusing on both the technological aspect of the solutions (e.g., communications, computing, data analysis, etc.), and the main CE concept(s) employed (i.e., reduce, reuse, recycle and restore) that each solution is the most relevant to. The role of each solution in the transition to CE is highlighted. Results suggest that ICT solutions related to data collection and data analysis, and in particular to the internet of things, blockchain, digital platforms, artificial intelligence algorithms, and software tools, are amongst the most popular solutions proposed by academic researchers. Results also suggest that greater emphasis is placed on the “reduce” component of the CE, although ICT solutions for the other “R” components, as well as holistic ICT-based solutions, do exist as well. Specific important challenges impeding the adoption of ICT solutions for the CE are also identified and reviewed, with consumer and business attitude, economic costs, possible environmental impacts, lack of education around the CE, and lack of familiarization with modern technologies being found among the most prominent ones. © 2020 by the authors.

Indeed, some have already hailed AI ‘the new oil’ since it has become a resource for businesses to streamline processes. This may be an imperfect analogy, but it does capture the excitement and high expectations surrounding the AI-driven economy. AI is a sub-field of computer science that enables intelligence exhibited by machines. For example, in the East African community, the Regional Electronic Cargo Tracking System (RECTS) is used to monitor cargo in transit from Mombasa in Kenya through Uganda to Rwanda and now in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This has transformed transit cargo management through deterring of dumping and diversion of transit cargo in real time. Previously, cargo would sometimes, if not most of the time, go unaccounted for while in transit, which caused government revenue leakage and business losses. This paper examines the global standards and actions in the uptake of AI for trade facilitation in smoothing customs operations. This study looks at how the uptake of AI has affected customs administration in terms of transit management and security of cargo as well as trade facilitation, which greatly reduces the cost of doing business by the private sector. Based on the study findings, the paper offers several recommendations for policy makers, including undertaking Private Public Partnerships (PPP), integration of RECTS with other Customs systems, well-planned change management and developing a pool of AI experts in Customs. © 2020, International Network of Customs Universities.

The selection of an appropriate method to introduce digitalization is crucial, as it affects the optimization level of the business processes. Methodology: Specific multicriteria selection method includes five steps to identify these approaches, considering the relative error for each approach, as it affects the outcome with the performance indicator of business process digitalization. The strongest criterion value is used to identify the optimal approach. The evaluation of the methods showed that the performance of the logistic, administrative, and innovative methods is not worse than the Pareto principle. Findings: Introducing digitalization in the administrative method has the biggest impact. The chosen method showed that Human Resources processes require modification to reduce costs. A mechanism to digitalize the personnel management processes using artificial intelligence was developed. Implications: The results of multivariate multicriteria analysis show that the implementation of artificial intelligence minimizes human factors and optimizes time and costs.

One of the ways is to use chatbot. Aside from being cost-effective, this method is also very effective and very easy for companies to use. To make an easy and effective chatbot requires a combination of two scientific fields, artificial intelligence and software engineering. This study has the following features. 1) Affective sentiment analysis, this feature is inspired by Russel's Circumplex Model. Adjective words will be mapped in a matrix with values based on the Russell Circumplex Model. This model will pay attention on the adjective words, polarity, and affection degree of a sentence. 2) Conjunction sentiment analysis, consider of free way of interaction nowdays, a sentiment analysis system need to determine the sentiment value in multilevel sentences. This multilevel sentence has one or more conjunctions. This conjunction sentiment system will break sentences based on conjunction. The fractional sentence will be processed by affective sentiment analysis. The system then considers the nature of the conjunction to determine the sentiment of the whole sentence. 3) Graph Chatbot, this feature is used to make it easy for companies to modify and generate their bots. This bot will interact with customers like humans, based on a graph chat map that has been created. Chatbot graphs were developed using javascript library Vue js to make it easier to manipulate the visual graph. The system produces satisfying accuracy. Graph chatbot can handle procedural conversations very well. The flow of conversation in accordance with the graph that has been defined. Graph chatbot has 100% accuracy and successfully responds to all user conversations. The sentiment method has 63% accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","affective conjunction sentiment; circumplex model.; interactive graph chatbot; retention rate","Cost effectiveness; Intelligent systems; Sales; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Software engineering; Circumplex models; Cost effective; Customer retention; Javascript; Scientific fields; Semantic recognition; Small-medium business; Visual Graph; Flow graphs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096781741

Technological innovations such as Fintech are rapidly transforming BFSI and have major competitiveness implications for legacy players. Key objective of our study is to understand the dimensions of innovation and identify options-particularly one based on MoT for sustainability-for firms in emerging countries. We adapt a mixed method approach, where analysis of factual secondary data will be complemented by insights from literature review and experts. Factual views indicate significant role of regional banks of Indian origin (BIOs), some of them are innovating quite well leveraging capabilities of increasing competitiveness of software (SW or ICT) firms and Fintech ventures, including service, product and platform innovations. We analyse the patterns of competitiveness using alternate frameworks of competitiveness from Porter Diamond to competitiveness Assets-Processes-Performance (APP), focusing on trends for Fintech's trying to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and 'Digital Transformation'. Findings indicate major disruptive threats to incumbent 'banking, financial services and insurance'(BFSI) majors in many emerging countries from fintech as well as technology giants such as GAFA. While efforts in countries such as India through 'Unified Payment Interface (UPI)' may address issues of financial access, evolving a dominant design demands much bigger 'architectural innovation'.

Firms that would emerge as leaders are those that reconfigure their production processes through cyber-physical technologies from mass production to customised products and services. For firms to successfully transition they would require, among others, understanding and adoption of new business models, and a workforce skilled in 4IR technologies. Africa has the youngest population with a potential to spur an accelerated economic growth known as a demographic dividend. For Africa, who is viewed as a potential economic powerhouse, the 4IR promises a socio-economic development through better access to technologies and increased productivity. However, the promises of the 4IR for Africa are often told alongside concerns that the 4IR might render the continent's workforce obsolete and reinforce already existing inequalities. The extent to which Africa could benefit from the 4IR would largely be a function of the continent's readiness to put in place policies that equip Africans with the skills needed to play an active role in shaping and benefiting from the 4IR. Yet Africa still lags behind when it comes to transitioning to the 4IR. This research investigated prospects and challenges for Africa in the era of the 4IR. A desktop literature study approach was followed, using published studies in journals, conference proceedings, book chapters and books for the period 2011 to 2020.

Many companies are experimenting with digital technologies, trying to make use of their potential and evaluate their impact on their businesses in terms of value creation and competitive advantage. It has been cited in the literature on how digital technologies like 5G, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data, and others, have the potential to improve products, processes, sales channels, and supply chains. Thus, companies that can leverage digital technology across their different businesses' aspects in a better position to succeed in the present digital economy. Before the evolution of IT and its pervasiveness, IT / technology strategy has been used as inferior to business strategy, aligned with the objectives of business strategy but not central to strategy formulation. When the business strategy is developed in isolation of the digital context, business decisions are made neglecting the power of digital technologies and what it can do to disrupt the whole business. Despite the significant interventions of executives to digitalize their companies for gaining a competitive edge in the digital economy, the reports show a failure rate of about 70% for organizations trying to execute digital transformation projects. There are no guidelines in academia on how to develop a proper digital transformation strategy for companies on the verge of disruption. In order to close this gap, this research attempts to develop “A strategy framework for the digital transformation of any company”. This framework is holistic and foundational, takes into consideration the promises of digitalization to the different aspects of business, and hence it constitutes an essential section in the strategy of the company. This research is conducted in two phases: Framework Synthesis and Framework Validation. In the “Framework Synthesis”, we identify general business strategy frameworks to synthesize the crucial elements of a business strategy without the impact of digital technologies. We then identify and analyze the effects of digitalization on the different businesses' aspects and components. This allows for the understanding of the promises of digitalization for the businesses and the impact it may create when formulating a digital business strategy. Different attempts to develop frameworks for digital business strategy or digital transformation strategies are identified. The above stages of studies enabled the researcher to develop a framework for the digitalization process for the companies. For the validation of the developed framework, the researcher conducted a number of semi-structured interviews with industry experts engaged in digital transformation projects across different sectors. Sectors include telecommunication, media, banking, public sector, among others. Their insights and experiences were absorbed, and their comments were gathered, and all were incorporated into the final proposed framework. The framework is comprised of three stages with four core dimensions which are: “Positioning”, “Business Model”, “Dynamic Capabilities” and the “Transformation Roadmap”. This framework will serve as general guidance for the formulation of a company's strategy for the digital transformation of its businesses that is necessary for its long-term existence and competitiveness. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

For example, in the supply chain management: IoT-networked sensors can provide real-time insight into the provenance of goods and materials, supplier performance, available capacity, predictive demand and other key data. In turn, this data can feed autonomous and intelligent processes that “learn” how to respond to changing circumstances. Classical ERP systems do not support this distributed innovation. Emerging Technologies in Cloud ERP are what brings the data and action together, reducing non-value-adding work and freeing up humans for more attention to strategic effort to grant the business and “delight” customers. Based on the experience of individuals involved in ERP implementation, it is concluded that organizations should stop thinking about AI, Machine Learning, IoT and Blockchain as disruptive challenges they need to overcome. On the contrary, it has become critical that companies invest time and money in understanding how these new emerging technologies can impact their business and drive innovation across their organization. The main purpose of this paper is to provide some guidelines for companies intended to upgrade their traditional ERP to gain from cloud ERP with combinatorial effects of emerging technologies such as AI, Blockchain and IoT. The paper also tries to answer the question, which emerging technology features should be required when procuring Cloud ERP Systems. The impact of AI on the Cloud ERP modules is discussed. In particular, the benefits of the application of AI technology in marketing, procurement, finance, inventory, human resources, planning, manufacturing, sales and services are investigated. © 2020 Towards the Digital World and Industry X.0 - Proceedings of the 29th International Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2020.

Instagram is one of those platforms, which is used not only by companies to promote their products but also by local governments to promote tourist destinations. Predicting the popularity of the promotional tourist destination images helps marketers to plan strategically. However, given the abundance of images posted on Instagram daily, identifying the factors that determine the popularity of an image is a big challenge, due to informal and noisy visual content, frequent content evolution, a lack of explicit visual elements, and people’s informal behavior in liking, commenting on, and viewing the images. We present an approach to identify the factors most responsible for the popularity of tourist destinations-related images on Instagram. Our approach provides a proof of concept for an artificial intelligence (AI)-based real-time content management system, which will help to promote a tourist destination. The experiments on a collection of posts crawled from the official Instagram account of Jeju Island, which is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Korea, show that the recency of the post is the most important predictor of the number of likes and comments it will receive. Moreover, the combination of visual content and context features is an excellent predictor of popularity. The number of likes and comments are found to be complementary to each other for predicting image popularity. © 2020 by the authors.

BIS, an impactful and leading technology, is being implemented in many industrial sectors but almost 80% of BIS fail to give expected results due to unknown reasons. Although many scholars put effort into finding the influential determinants for the BIS implementation, they neglect the BIS adoption context, especially in the textile and apparel industry. A purposive and proportionate choice of potential determinants in the context of adoption would contribute significantly to the success of BIS. Multi-stage research is employed to identify and prioritize the significant determinants. In the first stage, twenty-two semi-structured in-depth interviews are conducted with seventeen textile and apparel companies. Ten significant determinants emerged after thematic analysis of interview data. The determinants are sustainability, competitive pressure, market trends, compatibility, technology maturity, leadership commitment and support, satisfaction with existing systems, sustainable data quality and integrity, users' traits, and interpersonal communications that influence the adoption of BIS. In the second stage, the Best Worst Method (BWM) is used to calculate the weights for prioritizing the determinants based on experts' opinion. These weights are then used to evaluate and rank the determinants. The findings of this research show that the leadership commitment and support, sustainability, users' traits, and technology maturity, are the top-ranked determinants that influence the practitioners' choice to adopt the BIS in the textile and apparel industry. The results of this study enable the BIS stakeholders to holistically comprehend the significant determinants that would drive or impede the success of BIS projects in the sustainable textile and apparel industry. © 2020 by the authors.","Best worst method; Business intelligence system adoption; Determinants; Textile and apparel industry","artificial intelligence; business development; data quality; digitization; exploration; implementation process; industrial technology; leadership; prioritization; stakeholder; sustainability; technology adoption; textile industry",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091201642

In this paper, we review and call for marketing research to leverage machine learning methods. We provide an overview of common machine learning tasks and methods, and compare them with statistical and econometric methods that marketing researchers traditionally use. We argue that machine learning methods can process large-scale and unstructured data, and have flexible model structures that yield strong predictive performance. Meanwhile, such methods may lack model transparency and interpretability. We discuss salient AI-driven industry trends and practices, and review the still nascent academic marketing literature which uses machine learning methods. More importantly, we present a unified conceptual framework and a multi-faceted research agenda. From five key aspects of empirical marketing research: method, data, usage, issue, and theory, we propose a number of research priorities, including extending machine learning methods and using them as core components in marketing research, using the methods to extract insights from large-scale unstructured, tracking, and network data, using them in transparent fashions for descriptive, causal, and prescriptive analyses, using them to map out customer purchase journeys and develop decision-support capabilities, and connecting the methods to human insights and marketing theories. Opportunities abound for machine learning methods in marketing, and we hope our multi-faceted research agenda will inspire more work in this exciting area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Big data; Digital marketing; Interpretation; Machine learning; Marketing theory; Network; Prediction; Tracking data; Unstructured data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089690063

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of telehealth modalities was increasing slowly but steadily. During the public health emergency, rapid widespread telehealth implementation has been encouraged to promote patient and provider safety and preserve access to health care.Evidence Acquisition:Evidence was acquired from English language Internet searches of the medical and business literature and following breaking news on the COVID-19 pandemic and responses from health care stakeholders, including policymakers, payers, physicians, health care organizations, and patients. We also had extensive discussions with colleagues who are developing telehealth techniques relevant to neuro-ophthalmology.Results:Regulatory, legal, reimbursement, and cultural barriers impeded the widespread adoption of telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the increased use of telehealth in response to the public health emergency, we are rapidly accumulating experience and an evidence base identifying opportunities and challenges related to the widespread adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. One of the major challenges is the current inability to adequately perform funduscopy remotely.Conclusions:Telehealth is an increasingly recognized means of health care delivery. Tele-Neuro-Ophthalmology adoption is necessary for the sake of our patients, the survival of our subspecialty, and the education of our trainees and students. Telehealth does not supplant but supplements and complements in-person neuro-ophthalmologic care.

The increased attention to processes led to the recent growth of Business Process Management discipline, which quite exclusively adopt discrete-event modeling and simulation. This paper proposes a medical agent-oriented decision support system to integrate the achievements from management science, agent-based modeling, and artificial intelligence. In particular, we performed a practical application concerning a hospital emergency department medical system. We adopt the widely used multi-agent programmable modeling environment NetLogo. First, we demonstrated the ability to perform a clear representation of healthcare processes where agents (i.e., patients and hospital staff) operate in a 3D environment. This model allows performing a traditional what-if scenario analysis. Second, we explore how performing intelligent management of patients by applying genetic algorithms to find the criteria for the selection process of the subjects in the admission procedure.

Based on this research gap, we conducted a structured literature review to identify applications of AI in commercial banks and the challenges of implementing AI. Our findings suggest that by using AI, commercial banks can reduce losses in lending, increase security in processing payments, automate compliance-related work, and improve customer targeting.

Outcome of the development processes provides the finished design of the PD sensing device, known as Partial Discharge Detection (PDD) device. The functionality of the PDD device was also assessed through controlled experimentations, and they proved to be successful. Pure PD waveform captured by the ultrasonic sensor was similar when compared to a HFCT sensor's pure PD waveform. The PDD device is a small and affordable, and is opened to various improvements such as integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) unto the device, and one day may replace most existing bulky and expensive PD sensing devices that are readily available in the market.

However, this comes at the cost of high privacy risk. Because some of these patterns may contain business-sensitive information and hence are denoted as sensitive patterns. The revelation of such patterns can disclose confidential information. Privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) includes various sensitive pattern hiding (SPH) techniques, which ensures that sensitive patterns do not get revealed when data mining models are applied on shared datasets. In the process of hiding sensitive patterns, some of the non-sensitive patterns also become infrequent. SPH techniques thus affect the results of data mining models. Maintaining a balance between data privacy and data utility is an NP-hard problem because it requires the selection of sensitive items for deletion and also the selection of transactions containing these items such that side effects of deletion are minimal. There are various algorithms proposed by researchers that use evolutionary approaches such as genetic algorithm(GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). These evolutionary SPH algorithms mask sensitive patterns through the deletion of sensitive transactions. Failure in the sensitive patterns masking and loss of data have been the biggest challenges for such algorithms. The performance of evolutionary algorithms further gets degraded when applied on dense datasets. In this research paper, victim item deletion based PSO inspired evolutionary algorithm named VIDPSO is proposed to sanitize the dense datasets. In the proposed algorithm, each particle of the population consists of n number of sub-particles derived from pre-calculated victim items. The proposed algorithm has a high exploration capability to search the solution space for selecting optimal transactions. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic dense datasets depict that VIDPSO algorithm performs better vis-a-vis GA, PSO and ACO based SPH algorithms in terms of hiding failure with minimal loss of data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Evolutionary algorithm; Knowledge hiding technique; Particle swarm optimization; Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM); Sensitive pattern","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Data privacy; Hydrodynamics; NP-hard; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Business entities; Confidential information; Data mining models; Evolutionary approach; Frequent itemset mining; Privacy-preserving data mining; Sensitive informations; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083889740

There is, however, currently limited evidence of the effectiveness of these systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based computerised decision support systems in health and social care settings. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify relevant randomised controlled trials conducted between 2013 and 2018. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ASSIA, Emerald, Health Business Fulltext Elite, ProQuest Public Health, Social Care Online, and grey literature sources. Search terms were conceptualised into three groups: artificial intelligence-related terms, computerised decision support -related terms, and terms relating to health and social care. Terms within groups were combined using the Boolean operator OR, and groups were combined using the Boolean operator AND. Two reviewers independently screened studies against the eligibility criteria and two independent reviewers extracted data on eligible studies onto a customised sheet. We assessed the quality of studies through the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for randomised controlled trials. We then conducted a narrative synthesis. We identified 68 hits of which five studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies varied substantially in relation to quality, settings, outcomes, and technologies. None of the studies was conducted in social care settings, and three randomised controlled trials showed no difference in patient outcomes. Of these, one investigated the use of Bayesian triage algorithms on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and health-related quality of life in lung transplant patients. Another investigated the effect of image pattern recognition on neonatal development outcomes in pregnant women, and another investigated the effect of the Kalman filter technique for warfarin dosing suggestions on time in therapeutic range. The remaining two randomised controlled trials, investigating computer vision and neural networks on medication adherence and the impact of learning algorithms on assessment time of patients with gestational diabetes, showed statistically significant and clinically important differences to the control groups receiving standard care. However, these studies tended to be of low quality lacking detailed descriptions of methods and only one study used a double-blind design. Although the evidence of effectiveness of data-driven artificial intelligence to support decision-making in health and social care settings is limited, this work provides important insights on how a meaningful evidence base in this emerging field needs to be developed going forward. It is unlikely that any single overall message surrounding effectiveness will emerge - rather effectiveness of interventions is likely to be context-specific and calls for inclusion of a range of study designs to investigate mechanisms of action. © The Author(s) 2020.","artificial intelligence; decision support systems; narrative synthesis; randomised controlled trial; systematic review","artificial intelligence; Bayes theorem; female; health care delivery; human; newborn; pregnancy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); social support; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Pregnancy; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Social Support",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078122283

In media coverage and reporting, AI is predominantly described in contrasted terms, either as the ultimate solution to all human problems or the ultimate threat to all human existence. In academe, the focus of computer scientists is on developing systems that function, whereas philosophy scholars theorize about the implications of this functionality for human life. In the interface between technology and philosophy there is, however, one imperative aspect of AI yet to be articulated: how do intelligent systems make inferences? We use the overarching concept “Artificial Intelligent Behaviour” which would include both cognition/processing and judgment/behaviour. We argue that due to the complexity and opacity of artificial inference, one needs to initiate systematic empirical studies of artificial intelligent behavior similar to what has previously been done to study human cognition, judgment and decision making. This will provide valid knowledge, outside of what current computer science methods can offer, about the judgments and decisions made by intelligent systems. Moreover, outside academe—in the public as well as the private sector—expertise in epistemology, critical thinking and reasoning are crucial to ensure human oversight of the artificial intelligent judgments and decisions that are made, because only competent human insight into AI-inference processes will ensure accountability. Such insights require systematic studies of AI-behaviour founded on the natural sciences and philosophy, as well as the employment of methodologies from the cognitive and behavioral sciences. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Accountability; Artificial inference; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligent behaviour; Behavioral artificial intelligence; Bias; Ethics; Transparency","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Intelligent systems; Transparency; Accountability; Artificial inference; Artificial intelligent; Bias; Ethics; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076929211

We claim AI assistants present a new form of digital connectivity risk and a key aspect of this risk phenomenon is related to user risk awareness (or lack of) regarding AI assistant functionality. AI assistants present a significant societal risk phenomenon amplified by the global scale of the products and the increasing use in healthcare, education, business, and service industry. However, there appears to be little research concerning the need to not only understand the changing risks of AI assistant technologies but also how to frame and communicate the risks to users. How can users assess the risks without fully understanding the complexity of the technology? This is a challenging and unwelcome scenario. AI assistant technologies consist of a complex ecosystem and demand explicit and precise communication in terms of communicating and contextualising the new digital risk phenomenon. The paper then argues for the need to examine how to best to explain and support both domestic and commercial user risk awareness regarding AI assistants. To this end, we propose the method of creating a risk narrative which is focused on temporal points of changing societal connectivity and contextualised in terms of risk. We claim the connectivity risk narrative provides an effective medium in capturing, communicating, and contextualising the risks of AI assistants in a medium that can support explainability as a risk mitigation mechanism. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence assistants; Connectivity; Data commodification; Data monetisation; Explainability; Informed consent; Narratology; Risk; Risk communication; Risk perception","Artificial intelligence; Risk assessment; Risks; Connectivity; Data commodification; Data monetisation; Explainability; Informed consent; Narratology; Risk communication; Risk perception",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074815870

After showing how all the building blocks of algorithmic regulation are already well in place, we discuss the possible implications for human autonomy and social order.

Most finance/treasury teams are knowledge workers who make decisions and conduct analytics within often dynamic frameworks that must incorporate environmental considerations (foreign exchange rates, GDP forecasts), internal considerations (growth needs, business trends), as well as the impact of any actions on related corporate decisions which are also highly complex (e.g., hedging, investing, capital structure, liquidity levels). Artificial intelligence in finance and treasury is thus most analogous to the complexity of a human nervous system as it encompasses far more than the automation of tasks. Similar to the human nervous system, AI systems in finance/treasury must manage data quickly and accurately, including the capture and classification of data and its integration into larger datasets. At present, the AI network neural system has been gradually improved and is widely used in many fields of treasury management, such as early warning of potential financial crisis, diagnosis of financial risk, control of financial information data quality and mining of hidden financial data, information, etc. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Corporate finance and treasury management; Finance and Treasury 4.0; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Robotic process automation","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Electronic trading; Industry 4.0; Intelligent robots; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Classification of data; Dynamic framework; Environmental considerations; Financial information; Foreign exchange rates; Human nervous system; Process automation; Treasury management; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074460377

But artisanal products (e.g., handmade textiles) are valued precisely because of their human origins, and thus have some inherent “immunity” from AI job loss. At the same time, artisanal labor, combined with technology, could potentially help to democratize the economy, allowing independent, small-scale businesses to flourish. Could AI, robotics and related automation technologies enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of these beloved crafting professions, perhaps even expanding their niche to replace some job loss in other sectors? In this paper, we compare the problems created by the current mass production economy and potential solutions from an artisanal economy. In doing so, the paper details the possibilities of utilizing AI to support hybrid forms of human–machine production at the microscale; localized and sustainable value chains at the mesoscale; and networks of these localized and sustainable producers at the macroscale. In short, a wide range of automation technologies are potentially available for facilitating and empowering an artisanal economy. Ultimately, it is our hope that this paper will facilitate a discussion on a future vision for more “generative” economic forms in which labor value, ecological value and social value can circulate without extraction or alienation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artisanal economy; Ethnocomputing; Generative justice; Human–machine collaboration; Industrial symbiosis","Automation; Employment; Environmental technology; Artisanal economy; Automation technology; Economic viability; Environmental sustainability; Ethnocomputing; Generative justice; Industrial symbiosis; Machine production; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074359821

As more organizations experience crippling security breaches, the wave of compromised data is growing significantly. The financial consequences of a data breach are set on the rise, but the cost goes beyond potential fines. Data breaches could have a catastrophic impact not only in loss of company's reputation and stock price, but also in economic terms. Threat Intelligence has been recently introduced to enable greater visibility of cyber threats, in order to better protect organizations' digital assets and prevent data breaches. Threat intelligence is the practice of integrating and analyzing disjointed cyber data to extract evidence-based insights regarding an organization's unique threat landscape. This helps explain who the adversary is, how and why they are comprising the organization's digital assets, what consequences could happen following the attack, what assets actually could be compromised, and how to detect or respond to the threat. Every organization is different and threat intelligence frameworks are custom-tailored to the business process itself and the organization's risks, as there is no “one-size-fits-all” in cyber. In this paper, we review the problem of data breaches and discuss the challenges of implementing threat intelligence that scales in today's complex threat landscape and digital infrastructure. This is followed by an illustration of how the future of effective threat intelligence is closely linked to efficiently applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning approaches, and we conclude by outlining future research directions in this area. © Copyright © 2020 Ibrahim, Thiruvady, Schneider and Abdelrazek.","artificial intelligence; cybersecurity; data breaches; data intelligence; machine learning; threat intelligence",,Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104202907

These uses cases can be broadly categorized into the horizontal areas of maintenance and repair, operations and supply chain, quality, safety, design, and end-to-end optimization - with applications in a variety of verticals. In the last few years, we have witnessed a growing interest in applying Deep Learning (DL) techniques to Industrial AI problems, ranging from using sequence models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting failures in equipment, to using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) for scheduling and dispatching. Applying deep learning techniques to industrial applications imposes a set of unique challenges, which include, but are not limited to, (1) limited data, highly skewed class distribution and occurrence of rare classes such as failures, (2) multi-modal data (sensors, events, images, text, etc.) indexed over space and time (3) the need for explainable decisions, (4) a need to attain consistency between different but ""related"" models and between multiple generations of the same model, and (5) decision making to optimize business outcomes where the cost of a mistake could be very high. This tutorial presents an overview of these challenges, along with new methods and best practices to address them. Examples of these methods include using sequence DL models and Functional Neural Networks (FNNs) for modeling sensor and spatiotemporal measurements; using multi-task learning, graph models and ensemble learning for improving consistency of DL models; using deep RL for health indicator learning and dynamic dispatching; cost-based decision making for prognostics; and using GANs for generating senor data for prognostics.

LSTM networks are widely used in time series data as their learning algorithm does not present exploding and vanishing gradient descent issues as traditional recurrent neural networks with back propagation learning algorithms. This paper proposes the use of LSTM networks to predict the values of the different iBuilding variables, such as environmental conditions, energy consumption or occupancy. Intelligent Buildings are used as an investment portfolio, Technology and Artificial Intelligence plays a critical role to make a successful Return on Investment (ROI). The business case and main driver to use Artificial Intelligence in Intelligent Buildings is to predict the future value of iBuilding variables therefore preventive action can be taken in the present to reduce OPEX costs such as decreasing overnight heating due low predicted low occupancy or preventive maintenance on mechanical and electrical assets such as lifts with fault detection and diagnosis. The predictions of the proposed LSTM in iBuilding has been validated with several public datasets against other predictors. The obtained results demonstrate that LSTM networks are more accurate than the Linear Regression (LR) model, typically used within the embedded predictors found on common spreadsheet software. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Intelligence Buildings; Long Short-Term Memory; Neural Network","Backpropagation; Brain; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Backpropagation learning algorithm; Environmental conditions; Fault detection and diagnosis; Investment portfolio; Mechanical and electrical; Preventive action; Spreadsheet software; Vanishing gradient; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096971326

In the past few years, significant progress has been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The benefits of AI are obvious, but there is still huge uncertainty and controversy over the public perception of AI. How does the mass media conceptualize AI? Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors analyze the evolution of AI covered by five major news media outlets in the past 30 years from 7 dimensions: scientific subject, keyword, country, institution, people, topic and opinion polarity. Findings: First of all, different subjects are competing for and dividing up the right to speak of AI, leading to the gradual fragmentation of the concept of AI. Second, reporting on AI often includes reference to commercial institutions and scientists, showing a successful integration of science and business. Moreover, the result of topic modeling shows that news media mainly defines AI from three perspectives: an imagination, a commercial product and a field of scientific research. Finally, negative reports have focused on various issues relating to AI ethics. Originality/value: The results can help bridge various conversations surrounding AI and promote richer discussions, increase the participation of scientists, businesses, governments and the public and provide more perspectives on the functions, prospects and pitfalls of AI. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Conceptualization; Mass media; New technology; News coverage; Public perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083585147

These techniques have shown to be particularly effective in highly complex environments such as image processing, natural language processing and market price predictions. On the other hand, small companies are requiring more and more access to artificial intelligence to predict customer behavior and hence to avoid to be affected by the highly volatility and variance of the market. Unfortunately, most of these companies may not be able to afford the costs of current artificial intelligence advanced methods. Hence, in this paper we study a low-cost known alternative: decision tree classifiers. In particular, we focus our analysis on the benefits to use them to analyze market predictions with high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve over three databases: Social Network Advertising Sells, Organic Purchased Indicator, and Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention. The best decision tree models obtained were those that produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score from 0.81 to 0.96. In addition, we report the accuracy of our models which provided results ranging from 79.80 to 89.80. These results show that simple models like decision trees are good to understand the fluctuation and trends from market data, and since its simplicity are an alternative for small businesses willing to try artificial intelligence predictions. © 2020 IEEE.","C4.5; CART; Decision Tree; Market trend database","Commerce; Decision trees; Deep learning; Forecasting; Image processing; Intelligent computing; Natural language processing systems; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Complex environments; Customer behavior; Decision tree classifiers; Learning techniques; Market prediction; NAtural language processing; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Small companies; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097548427

Companies are increasingly experimenting with innovative ways of implementing edge/cloud (re)training of AI systems to exploit large quantities of data to optimize their business value. Despite the obvious benefits, companies face challenges as the decision on how to implement edge/cloud (re)training depends on factors such as the task intent, the amount of data needed for (re)training, edge-to-cloud data transfer, the available computing and memory resources. Based on action research in a software-intensive embedded systems company where we study multiple use cases as well as insights from our previous collaborations with industry, we develop a generic framework consisting of five architectural alternatives to deploy AI on the edge utilizing transfer learning. We validate the framework in four additional case companies and present the challenges they face in selecting the optimal architecture. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we develop a generic framework consisting of five architectural alternatives ranging from a centralized architecture where cloud (re)training is given priority to a decentralized architecture where edge (re)training is instead given priority. Second, we validate the framework in a qualitative interview study with four additional case companies.

The Internet has become an effective channel for social interactions nowadays. Peoples' immense dependence on digital platform opens doors for fraud. Phishing is a type of cybercrime to steal users' credentials from online platforms such as online banking, online business, e-commerce, online classroom, digital marketplaces, etc. Phishers develop fake webpages alike the original one and send spam emails to hook the users. Phishers seize users' credentials when an online user visits the counterfeit webpages through the spams. Researchers have introduced enormous tools like blacklist, white-list, and antivirus software to detect phishing webpages. Attackers always devise creative ways to exploit human and network weakness to penetrate cyber defense. This paper presents a data-driven framework for detecting phishing webpages using deep learning approach. More precisely, a multilayer perceptron, which is also referred as a feed-forward neural network is used to predict the phishing webpages. The dataset was collected from Kaggle and contains information of ten thousand webpages. It consists of ten attributes. The proposed model has achieved 95% training accuracy and 93% test accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Machine learning; Phishing attack; Phishing attack detection","Computer viruses; Feedforward neural networks; Multilayer neural networks; Network security; Websites; Antivirus softwares; Digital marketplace; Digital platforms; Learning approach; Online classroom; Phishing attacks; Social interactions; Training accuracy; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094866421

In the world of big data from large number of transactions, detecting and preventing anomaly cases like fraudulent activities is an essential ingredient to success not only to big banks, insurance companies, small businesses, but also to consumers. Forms and levels of sophistication of online fraud are constantly changing, hence there is a need for a flexible framework that can predict and adjust to new fraudulent cases. One major problem in building a predictive model for anomaly detection, is the scarcity of fraudulent data records in comparison to non-fraudulent, which makes the training data imbalanced. In this paper, we present a comprehensive predictive analytics framework that aims at detecting anomaly cases and most importantly mitigating the problem of imbalanced datasets in training anomaly detection models. The framework is developed through experimentation of an ensemble of sampling algorithms, feature engineering methods, and an array of machine learning algorithms. The framework presented in this study provides a data-driven approach applied to financial credit card data and can be adapted to other domains where deviations from what is normal occur in large datasets. © 2020 IEEE.","anomaly detection; artificial intelligence; credit card data; data science; feature selection; finance; fraud detection; imbalanced dataset; predictive analytics","Insurance; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Anomaly detection models; Data-driven approach; Feature engineerings; Flexible framework; Imbalanced Data-sets; Insurance companies; Predictive modeling; Sampling algorithm; Anomaly detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092317335

The exponential growth of loT devices on the Internet, results in a lot of challenges because the current Internet was not necessarily designed to cater for resource constrained devices. There is, therefore, a need to investigate an alternative Internet architecture that will take into account such device limitations and quantities. Named Data Networking (NDN) has been shown to be one of those architectures. Preliminary studies so far show that NDN has more advantages over the current TCP/IP architecture. NDN has forwarding strategies! schemes that are essentially rules that tell NDN nodes how to forward interests and data packets from consumers to producers and back. This study aims to evaluate some of the forwarding strategies available in NDN, that is, best route, broadcast, multicast, and client-control strategy in different topologies that are star, mesh, ring, and a hybrid topology composed by mesh and star topology. The study was conducted by varying the number of producers in each topology, and the experimental results show that the multicast strategy outperforms the other strategies in a mesh, ring, and hybrid topology. ©2020 IEEE.","Forwarding strategies; Named Data Networking; Topologies-Internet of Things (Io'I}","Agricultural robots; Air conditioning; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Convolutional codes; Mesh generation; Multicasting; Network architecture; Stars; Topology; Control strategies; Exponential growth; Forwarding strategies; Hybrid topologies; Internet architecture; Named data networkings; Resourceconstrained devices; Smart agricultures; Data communication systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092048349

Due to the discreet manner whereby information is collected, consumers are often oblivious that they are providing businesses with information such as IP addresses and the pages they view. Cookies and tracking devices can also provide personal information of consumers to businesses. Businesses do not comprehend their misuse of consumer data until they sustain a privacy breach, which could lead to financial and reputational damage to the business as well as a loss of consumer trust and loyalty. Businesses however have both a legal and moral onus to protect consumer's personal data in a dignified manner. The objective of this study is to propose a framework for consumer privacy protection strategy. Forrester's data security and privacy playbook provides the tools, information and analysis to help businesses protect sensitive data from cybercrime and privacy abuse by means of a framework that has a three-step process, Discover, Plan and Act. The framework is developed within Forrester's playbook. The justification for the proposition of this framework is to mitigate the detrimental consequences of a privacy breach and ensure that businesses no longer treat consumer privacy protection as an afterthought. © 2020 IEEE.","Consumer information privacy protection; Information privacy; Privacy breach","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Convolutional codes; Data communication systems; Data privacy; Information dissemination; Consumer information; Data security and privacy; Digital technologies; Personal information; Privacy breaches; Reputational damage; Three-step process; Tracking devices; Consumer protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092035876

However, scant attention has been paid to determine how disruptive technologies influence smart cities. Through a systemic literature review, this paper provides a point-by-point consideration of 'nested' disruptive technologies, namely, the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles (AV), artificial general intelligence (AGI) and 5G networks (5G), and the factors affecting their deployment in the context of smart cities. This paper also discusses why these are important disruptive technologies for smart cities and how these technologies influence them. The main challenges of implementing these disruptive technologies have been identified in the literature and are discussed in this paper. This paper also offers suggestions on the implementation of these disruptive technologies for practitioners of smart cities, so that they can consider them while digitalizing smart cities. In addition to discussing research implications, the paper also throws light on theoretical contributions and recommends ways to leverage these disruptive technologies for smart cities. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","5G networks; artificial general intelligence; autonomous vehicles; Disruptive technologies; Internet of Things; smart cities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091763056

To do so, the multi-expert system paradigm was used to aggregate the different expertises required for a good guidance, the multi-agent system principle was used to have a modular and easily scalable ecosystem. Indeed, the agents of the system communicate with each other using the FIPA-ACL language, in a collaborative vision, throughout the orientation assistance process to perform tasks such as proposing business sectors, occupations, training, and training paths. The ontologies of the Semantic Web have been used to have a complete semantic description of the shared information and to promote communication between the different software agents of the ecosystem. Big Data principles have also been deployed to manage and exploit structured and unstructured data from different data sources related to the guidance ecosystem. The ecosystem modeled in this way has several innovative and powerful technological and scientific aspects. Thus, in terms of design and modelling, the proposed ecosystem considers all the actors and factors involved in the guidance process, including labor market trends.

Data were collected for the groups based on 10 years of historical records. The value predictions are created for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days in advance. Various machine learning algorithms were utilized for prediction of future values of stock market groups. We employed decision tree, bagging, random forest, adaptive boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and artificial neural networks (ANN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). Ten technical indicators were selected as the inputs into each of the prediction models. Finally, the results of the predictions were presented for each technique based on four metrics. Among all algorithms used in this paper, LSTM shows more accurate results with the highest model fitting ability.

Therefore, a deeper insight of load forecasting techniques for projecting future electricity demands becomes imperative for business entities and policy makers. The electricity demand is governed by a set of different variables or ""electricity demand determinants"". These demand determinants depend on forecasting horizons (long term, medium term, and short term), the load aggregation level, climate, and socio-economic activities. In this paper, a review of different electricity demand forecasting methodologies is provided in the context of a group of low and middle income countries. The article presents a comprehensive literature review by tabulating the different demand determinants used in different countries and forecasting the trends and techniques used in these countries. A comparative review of these forecasting methodologies over different time horizons reveals that the time series modeling approach has been extensively used while forecasting for long and medium terms. For short term forecasts, artificial intelligence-based techniques remain prevalent in the literature. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the demand determinants in these countries indicates a frequent use of determinants like the population, GDP, weather, and load data over different time horizons. Following the analysis, potential research gaps are identified, and recommendations are provided, accordingly. © 2020 by the authors.","Demand determinants; Forecasting horizon; Load forecasting; Low and middle income countries","artificial intelligence; comparative study; electricity generation; literature review; policy making; socioeconomic status; uncertainty analysis",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089656125

Due to the advancing digitalization of business sectors and increasing competitive pressures, industrial companies are forced to promote their own digital transformation to sustain on the market. Here, the literature regards the CFO as a key corporate function to induce digitization initiatives within organizations. The blockchain technology, due to its features of transparency, immutability and cryptography combined with its ability to coordinate data flows of e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) or Artificial Intelligence (AI), constitutes a suitable instrument for the CFO to meet the requirements of Industry 4.0. This paper provides a contribution to address existing research gaps regarding the application side of blockchain technology. Thus, the objective of this work is to provide corporate financial functions, such as the CFO of an industrial company, with an understanding of the extent to which blockchain technology can be used for the role-specific responsibilities. Therefore, the underlying qualitative study explores the influence of blockchain technology on the CFO-function of an industrial company. Thus, intending to address a research gap on the application side, it asks (1) What is the impact of blockchain technology on the financial as well strategic role of the CFO? (2) What is the impact of blockchain technology in convergence with the Machine Economy on the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the CFO? (3) What is the impact of blockchain-enabled integrated business ecosystems on the role of the CFO? Based on a review of literature, semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with 23 participants. Analysis of the responses demonstrated a considerable impact of blockchain technology on the CFO-function. The results indicate improvements of business processes in regard to efficiency and automation, a relocation of the CFO's strategic role, improvements of CFO-relevant KPIs through integrating machines into payment networks as well as the emergence of integrated business ecosystems facilitating new forms of inter-organizational collaboration. Necessary prerequisites for adoption include digital competences of the CFO, appropriate organizational structures, digital currencies and identities on the blockchain, a change of the competitive mindset as well as standardized platforms with a neutral governance. © 2020 by the authors.","Blockchain technology; Business ecosystems; Business process optimization; CFO; Internet of things; KPI; Machine economy; Smart contracts","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Blockchain; Economics; Ecosystems; Finance; Internet of things; Chief financial officers; Competitive pressure; Digital transformation; Industrial companies; Internet of thing (IOT); Interorganizational collaboration; Key performance indicators; Organizational structures; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089537995

The use of AI appears to show significant promise in ER triage in the present. We briefly discuss the emerging effectiveness of AI in the ER imaging setting by looking at some of the products approved by the FDA and finding their way into “practice.” The FDA approval process to date has focused on applications that affect patient triage and not necessarily ones that have the computer serve as the only or final reader. We describe a select group of applications to provide the reader with a sense of the current state of AI use in the ER setting to assess neurologic, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal trauma indications. In the process, we highlight the benefits of triage staging using AI, such as accelerating diagnosis and optimizing workflow, with few downsides. The ability to triage patients and take care of acute processes such as intracranial bleed, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism will largely benefit the health system, improving patient care and reducing costs.

Rather, the innovative software is improving throughput, contributing to the timeliness in which radiologists can get to read abnormal scans, and possibly enhances radiologists’ accuracy.

Under this digitalization trend, a new concept of product and service offerings, Smart PSS has been introduced. While the Smart PSS concept aiming at data-driven innovation attracts more attentions, there are two major challenges in designing Smart PSS. First, available data from digital technologies are actually limited by technical, financial, and social reasons. Second, the context of applying Smart PSS dynamically changes, which makes designed Smart PSS unfit to the target situation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an evolutionary design framework for Smart PSS. Our approach is based on the service engineering research, which has been contributing to the design and development of PSS. The proposed framework consists of three conceptual spaces and three cycles. The main features of the framework were two design cycles; in-system and ex-system design cycle. In-system design cycle is a process of creating and applying human knowledge for making the most use of data collected by digital technologies. Ex-system design cycle is to adapt to dynamic changes in contexts of the applied Smart PSS. We examine how the proposed framework works for designing a Smart PSS, with a case study about the digitalization of a restaurant business. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Digitalization; Evolutionary design framework; Service engineering; Smart PSS","Artificial intelligence; Information systems; Conceptual spaces; Design and Development; Digital technologies; Dynamic changes; Evolutionary design; Human knowledge; Product and services; Service engineering; Systems analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086498373

However, facing the structural changes in B2B logistics orders, without any transformation of logistics operating process in distribution centres, LSPs are experiencing serious challenges in handling B2B e-commerce orders. In order for LSPs to grasp the market pie of the logistics and distribution sector of the e-commerce business through improving the core capability of handling B2B e-commerce order in their distribution centres, this paper proposes a novel approach for LSPs to systematically execute B2B order pre-processing so that the B2B e-commerce orders are better managed. An intelligent B2B order handling system (IOHS) is developed for efficient management of discrete, frequently arrived B2B e-commerce orders. By applying the “warehouse postponement” concept through the development of IOHS integrating cloud database management, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm approach, B2B order grouping solutions are effectively generated. A case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based logistics service provider who handles outsourced B2B e-commerce orders, indicating the feasibility of the proposed solution to facilitate e-order fulfilment under both fixed and variable time-window batching settings in distribution centres. A significant improvement in terms of the throughput rate of handling B2B e-commerce order in the distribution centre is found, thereby increasing the satisfaction of buyers and sellers throughout the order handling and delivery process, as well as facilitating LSPs’ capability to manage a larger number of orders received from B2B e-commerce platform, given the greater product exposure of sellers in today's B2B e-business. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; E-commerce order handling; Online order batching; Pick-to-sort systems; Real time operational decision making; Warehouse management","Fuzzy logic; Genetic algorithms; Service industry; Warehouses; Business to business; Distribution centres; Distribution sector; E-commerce business; Efficient managements; Genetic algorithm approach; Logistics service provider; Market opportunities; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085664266

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Business; Machine learning; Management; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study","Accident prevention; Agricultural robots; Decision support systems; Health care; Job satisfaction; Leisure industry; Project management; Reusability; Service industry; Social aspects; Supply chains; Tourism; Business and management; Design and evaluations; Health-care managements; Multi-disciplinary approach; Multiple stakeholders; Rigorous evaluation; Systematic literature review; Technology adoption; Information management; artificial intelligence; business development; literature review; machine learning; management; social impact; technology adoption",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085273894

Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agenda for practice; AI; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Environmental governance; Natural environment; Research agenda; Sustainability","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Economics; Land use; Environmental governances; Environmental sustainability; Innovative solutions; Intervention strategy; Machine learning models; Natural environments; Organizational process; Practical solutions; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083357298

Some consumers make an agreement for a fixed amount of resources, these being the required resources that are needed to execute its business. Consumers may need additional resources on top of these fixed resources, known as– marginal resources that are only consumed and paid for in case of an increase in business demand. In such contracts, both parties agree on a pricing model in which a consumer pays upfront only for the fixed resources and pays for the marginal resources when they are used. A marginal resource allocation is a challenge for service provider particularly small- to medium-sized service providers as it can affect the usage of their resources and consequently their profits. This paper proposes a novel marginal resource allocation decision support model to assist cloud providers to manage the cloud SLAs before its execution, covering all possible scenarios, including whether a consumer is new or not, and whether the consumer requests the same or different marginal resources. The model relies on the capabilities of the user-based collaborative filtering method with an enhanced top-k nearest neighbor algorithm and a fuzzy logic system to make a decision. The proposed framework assists cloud providers manage their resources in an optimal way and avoid violations or penalties. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is shown through a cloud scenario which demonstrates that our proposed approach can assists cloud providers to manage their resources wisely to avoid violations. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cloud computing; Cloud resource management; Decision support system; Fuzzy systems; Marginal resources; SLA violation; Violation penalty","Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Collaborative filtering; Economics; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Nearest neighbor search; Pattern recognition; Resource allocation; Collaborative filtering methods; K nearest neighbor algorithm; Marginal resources; Resource allocation decision; Resource management; Service Level Agreements; SLA violation; Violation penalty; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077086814

Due to the wide use of software products and services, failure in the software industry has implications on the industry itself as well as the economy at the local, national and global levels. This study compares the classification performance of thirteen approaches in terms of predicting firm failure in the US software industry. Seven measures are used to evaluate the classifiers’ performance. We use synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), SMOTEBoost and SMOTEBagging to account for the data imbalance issue. In order to give managers enough time to develop strategies and take the necessary actions to reduce the likelihood of failing, we use 20 financial indicators collected 4 years before the last available date about each firm. Our findings show that embedding SMOTE into boosting and bagging algorithms is better than preprocessing data using SMOTE before learning the classifier. According to the sensitivity analysis, research and development expense is the most significant predictor of firm failure followed by net sales and total revenue. Our results can be used by managers as a decision support tool to identify high-risk firms at an early stage and take the necessary actions to prevent a firm from failing. The early prediction of firm failure will allow software firms to modularize their products or services into specific “features” and offer them as “digital services” using new business models or combine these services with partner firms’ services to create new products and address evolving customer expectations. Moreover, the early prediction of firm failure in the software industry calls on firms, both new and those in the growth stage, to componentize their design for adaptability and to build agility in the way firms use their resource mix to address both market gaps as well as operational gaps. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Data mining; Decision support systems; Imbalanced data; Software industry","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Economics; Failure analysis; Forecasting; Managers; Sensitivity analysis; Software engineering; Classification performance; Customer expectation; Decision support tools; Financial indicator; Imbalanced data; Research and development; Software industry; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075364293

However, these models are often not well aligned with the core business requirement of profit maximization, in the sense that, the models fail to take into account not only misclassification costs, but also the benefits originating from a correct classification. Therefore, the aim is to construct churn prediction models that are profitable and preferably interpretable too. The recently developed expected maximum profit measure for customer churn (EMPC) has been proposed in order to select the most profitable churn model. We present a new classifier that integrates the EMPC metric directly into the model construction. Our technique, called ProfTree, uses an evolutionary algorithm for learning profit driven decision trees. In a benchmark study with real-life datasets from various telecommunication service providers, we show that ProfTree achieves significant profit improvements compared to classic accuracy driven tree-based methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Classification; Customer churn prediction; Evolutionary algorithm; Profit-based model evaluation","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Sales; Trees (mathematics); Area under the ROC curve; Binary classification problems; Classification algorithm; Customer churn prediction; Misclassification costs; Model evaluation; Performance measure; Telecommunication service provider; Profitability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058042486

The emergence of robots has attracted increasing interest from business scholars and practitioners alike. In this article, we undertake a systematic review of the business literature about the impact of service robots on customers and employees with the objective of guiding future research. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed the literature on service robots as they relate to customers and employees in business journals listed in the Financial Times top 50 journals plus all journals covered in the cross-disciplinary SERVSIG literature alerts. Findings: The analysis of the identified studies yielded multiple observations about the impact of service robots on customers (e.g. overarching frameworks on acceptance and usage of service robots; characteristics of service robots and anthropomorphism; and potential for enhanced and deteriorated service experiences) and service employees (e.g. employee benefits such as reduced routine work, enhanced productivity and job satisfaction; potential negative consequences such as loss of autonomy and a range of negative psychological outcomes; opportunities for human–robot collaboration; job insecurity; and robot-related up-skilling and development requirements). We also conclude that current research on service robots is fragmented, is largely conceptual in nature and focused on the initial adoption stage. We feel that more research is needed to build an overarching theory. In addition, more empirical research is needed, especially on the long(er)-term usage service robots on actual behaviors, the well-being and potential downsides and (ethical) risks for customers and service employees. Research limitations/implications: Our review focused on the business and service literature. Future work may want to include additional literature streams, including those in computer science, engineering and information systems.

This research considers stakeholders that operate in the Tyrol–Veneto macroregion (the Tyrol, South Tyrol and Veneto areas), a significant case of moderately innovative European macroregion. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes explorative research based on a qualitative method. It adopts a place-based multi-stakeholder approach to emphasise the role of three categories of stakeholders (companies, educational system and regional governments) in facing digital changes. More precisely, interviews with 60 stakeholders from the Tyrol–Veneto macroregion were conducted and examined via both text mining analysis and content analysis. First, correspondence factor analysis was performed using IRaMuTeQ software to identify homogeneous subsets of concepts (pillars–i.e., macroareas of strategic actions). Second, two coding phases were implemented using NVivo software to detect strategic fields of action and specific strategic actions undertaken to address the challenges of digital transformation. Findings: The results highlight that digital transformation is a pervasive challenge of regional innovative system that requires a multifaceted set of strategic actions falling into three main pillars. The first pillar, named “culture and skills”, includes three strategic fields of action as follows: digital education, talents and digital culture. The second pillar, named “infrastructures and technologies”, points out the need of information, interaction and artificial intelligence as key strategic fields of action. The third pillar, named “ecosystems”, highlights the importance of investing in medium- to long-term visions, partnerships and life quality. In brief, this study shows that standalone interventions are insufficient to tackle digital transformation from a systemic perspective. Moreover, this study outlines the potential contribution of each category of stakeholder to foster the digitalisation of the Tyrol–Veneto macroregion. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of developing digital culture and skills before investing in digital infrastructure and technology in a moderately innovative macroregion. Companies should alter their vision before reconfiguring their business models, invest in smart working and establish contacts with start-ups. In addition, this study recommends that public administration should mainly invest in digital education and partnerships, while, in terms of education and training organisations, it suggests providing digital skills to several cohorts of both students and workers. Policy implications call for the creation of new occasions of cooperation among stakeholders by fostering “table talks” as strategic and policy actions and by making more financial resources available to encourage the digital transformation processes. Originality/value: The results of this study may be adapted to the characteristics of other regional innovative systems and used as a reference point in terms of the improvement of business, market and local development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture and skills; Digital ecosystems; Infrastructure and services; Place-based strategies; Regional innovation system; Technology","Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Public administration; Regional planning; Students; Text mining; Correspondence factor analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Digital infrastructures; Digital transformation; Education and training; Multi-stakeholder approach; Public administrators; Regional innovation systems; E-learning",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083843630

Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics. Design/methodology/approach: As rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article. A sum of 1,854 articles extracted from Scopus database for the year 2018–2019 (31st of May) with selected keywords (artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, agent-based systems, expert systems, big data analytics and operations management) along with certain filters (subject–business, management and accounting; language-English; document–article, article in press, review articles and source-journals).

In this process, foreign trade English plays an important role. Foreign trade English is unique, professional and practical. Under different scenes of foreign trade, English words can express different meanings. In the course of trade, foreign trade English can help both of parties to communicate, and can achieve the translation of language, the interpretation of contract, the understanding of letter and so on. In the process of language communication and reading important documents, we need a solid foundation of English language and profound foreign cultural background, and have a strong ability to deal with the professional knowledge of international trade and the use of English vocabulary. The characteristics of foreign trade English language are analyzed in terms of vocabulary, style and grammar. At the same time, in the process of language understanding and translation, we need to meet the requirements of real-time. With the frequent exchange of foreign trade between our country and other countries, a large number of English documents will be produced, the relevant departments have put forward higher requirements for the accuracy of these documents and real time of these documents, the traditional manual translation can not meet the growing demand for foreign trade translation. With the help of computer aided-translation software memoQ, we help people do auxiliary translation, therefore, it can reduce translator's burden and improve the accuracy of translation and efficiency of translation.

In the present study, we further examined this trust effect on DSS-cued forgetting and related positive effects on users’ cognitive resources, performance, and well-being. Moreover, we investigated how trust translates into behavioural intentions to use a DSS, and into actual usage of the DSS. Finally, we examined if risk-related framing of decision outcomes (loss vs. gain framing) moderates trust effects on directed forgetting and behavioural intentions. In line with our expectations, results of an experiment with N = 200 participants confirmed that trust significantly enhances directed forgetting, performance, and well-being. Behavioural intentions fully mediated the trust effect on DSS use. Framing of decision outcomes showed no moderation but a main effect on directed forgetting, with loss framing reducing the directed forgetting effect. Practitioner summary: This experimental study demonstrates the importance of trust in information systems to leverage positive effects of these systems on users’ cognitive resources, performance, and well-being in a simulated complex business setting.

According to the education system of Bangladesh, an 8th grade completing student has to choose a group (science, Business Studies, humanity) for further studies. This group will be his/her initial highway for higher education. But it is a matter of sorrow that, in Bangladesh this crucial event is done by some rumors and some traditional old school ways, which are mostly wrong and destructive. From the perspective of this country, the only way of choosing those groups is previous result. Of course, result is one of the most important attribute, but it should not be the only thing. Again in this country, Science is thought to be superior than other groups. That's why, parents have the tendency to impose this group to their children without knowing their ability and interest and leads them towards an uncertain future. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to build a model of group selection by analyzing some random attributes of higher level students who have already gone through this event of selecting groups with the help of data mining and some machine learning algorithms, so that a newly 9th grade student could have the proper direction of selecting a group which is best for him/her.

The main objective of this paper consists in analyzing bank experiences when they introduce AI from the theory of dynamic capabilities and the resource-based view approach. Documentary research enables the description of experiences in three companies from the financial industry. It has been considered of interest to include different international experiences. For that reason, a firm providing debit and credit card services has been included, MasterCard, along with international banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Caixa Bank. Results show that AI enables firms to promote new relationships with customers, detect their needs or experiences, and adapt the service given by firms to be more competitive. AI also allows them to speed up responses to customers answers and doubts through its value chain. This research also shows that the proper implementation of AI permits a reconfiguration of traditional banking scenario. Detection, absorption, integration, and innovation are capabilities that allow these firms to build the managerial skills oriented to save costs, increase efficiency, and be more competitive.

The specifics of the economic activity of pharmaceutical companies are that their products contribute to improving the life quality of the human capital in each country and, as a result, the sustainable economic development of the national economy as a whole. In these conditions, it is important for investors to focus not only on the motivation for maximum profit, but also on the social orientation of their activities, in order to solve the contradiction between high costs and the planned level of profitability for manufacturing companies, on the one hand, and affordable pricing for the end consumer, on the other hand. At the same time, the financial and economic stability of pharmaceutical companies, despite the low price elasticity of demand, which in market conditions usually leads to an increase in the profitability of companies, depends on a combination of constraining factors. These factors include, first of all, high entry barriers to the industry associated with strict requirements for product quality and certification of economic activities by state institutions, large amounts of investment and a long payback period for projects, economic and financial risks, features of logistics chains, and technological challenges. Therefore, the study of these factors is clearly relevant for the entire Russian pharmaceutical industry, focused on competitive self-sufficiency, as well as for individual companies and potential investors. In order to fix new trends in business financing, the structure of the financial and economic activity plan of a medical company operating in the pharmaceutical industry was analyzed, and recommendations were given to improve financial planning in such companies, taking into account the changing needs of the market and a stable financing model. The purpose of the research is to identify the most significant determinants that determine the financial and economic stability of pharmaceutical companies, as well as their prospects for development at the micro and macro levels. To achieve this goal, we used General scientific methods of scientific analysis, including a systematic approach, methods of analogy and statistical analysis, a case method for identifying factors and ways to assess financial and economic stability on the example of specific companies, including the possibility of using integral indicators. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

Background and Objectives: The manufacturing of wood-based products by small-scale family-held business is commonly affected by a lack ofmonitoring data that, on the one hand, may prevent the decision-making process and, on the other hand, may lead to less technical efficiency that could result in business failure. Long-term performance of such manufacturing facilities is limited because data collection and analysis require significant resources, thus preventing the approaches that could be pursued for competitivity improvement. Materials and Methods: An external sensor system composed of two dataloggers-a triaxial accelerometer and a sound pressure level meter-was used in combination with a video camera to provide the input signals and meta-documentation for the training and testing of an artificial neural network (ANN) to check the accuracy of automatic classification of the time spent in operations. The study was based on a sample of ca. 90 k observations collected at a frequency of 1 Hz. Results: The approach provided promising results in both the training (ca. 20 k) and testing (ca. 60 k) datasets, with global classification accuracies of ca. 85%. However, the events characterizing the effective sawing, which requires electrical power, were even better recognized, reaching a classification accuracy of 98%. Conclusions: The system requires low-cost devices and freely available software that could enable data feeding on local computers by their direct connection to the devices. As such, it could collect, analyze and plot production data that could be used for maintaining the competitiveness of traditional technologies. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper evaluates the status and prospects of China's AI innovation ecosystem by developing a Triple Helix framework particularized for this case. Based on an in-depth qualitative study and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills, knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall, this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context, the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; China; Ecosystems theory; Innovation ecosystems; Triple helix","Competition; Business to customers; Dynamic contexts; Ecosystem approach; Future perspectives; Global leadership; Qualitative study; Status and prospect; Triple helixes; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083340447

For the development of sustainable entrepreneurship in recent years, business schools worldwide have recognised their roles, and started providing entrepreneurship education (EE). Due to being in emerging phase, the EE at business schools is following pedagogic approaches that are not exclusively developed for entrepreneurship, and hence, not suitable with the practical entrepreneurial needs. This leaves graduates lacking in many types of entrepreneurial skill-sets. One of those key skill-sets is entrepreneurial marketing (EM), which is one of the most dominating problems for SME entrepreneurs for the survival and growth of their businesses. Furthermore, the literature highlights that lack of EM skill-set is also one of the leading causes of entrepreneurial failure. The failure of SME entrepreneurs not only discourages them, but also damages the initiatives taken by the governments and private institutions for entrepreneurship development in the economies. Thus, considering the critical importance of EM education for the development of entrepreneurship, this paper has highlighted the pedagogical gaps in EM education, proposed future research avenues, and made practical implications for business schools’ academic authorities to upgrade their pedagogical models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business school; Entrepreneurial failure; Entrepreneurial marketing; Entrepreneurship development; Entrepreneurship education; Pedagogy; SME entrepreneur; Theory-practice gap",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081281583

Developing an effective classification rule induction (CRI) framework for bankruptcy prediction and credit risk analysis in appropriate time is essential to prevent the business communities from being bankrupt. Traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques play a major role to predict bankruptcy and credit risks. Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts. In this paper, a unified framework for qualitative and quantitative bankruptcy analysis using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based ant-miner algorithm is proposed. Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository. The proposed method is successfully applied and the performance analysis prove that ant-miner method is better than existing classifiers namely Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in terms of various performance analysis factors. Furthermore, the proposed ant-miner model is found to be a more suitable method for bankruptcy prediction when compared to other traditional statistical and artificial intelligence techniques. © 2017 The Authors","Ant-miner; Bankruptcy prediction; Classification Rule Induction; Credit risk analysis; Swarm intelligence",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032935919

In recent years, many intelligent DSS (IDSS) in business contexts involve machine learning (ML) methods, which make them inherently hard to explain and comprehend logically. Incomprehensible predictions, however, might violate the users' expectations. While explanations can help with this, prior research also shows that providing explanations in all situations may negatively impact trust and adherence, especially for users experienced in the decision task at hand. We used a human-centered design approach with domain experts to design a DSS for funds management in the construction industry and identified a strong need for control, personal involvement, and adequate data. To create an adequate level of trust and reliance, we contrasted the system's predictions with the values derived from an analytic hierarchical process (AHP), which makes the relative importance of our users' decision-making criteria explicit. We developed a prototype and evaluated its acceptance with 7 construction industry experts. By identifying situations in which the ML prediction and the domain expert potentially disagree, the DSS can identify a persuasion gap and use explanations more selectively. Our evaluation showed promising results and we plan to generalize our approach to a wider range of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) problems, e.g., to provide explanations with arguments tailored to the user. © 2020 ACM.","Analytical hierarchical process; Decision support systems; Decision-making; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretability","Artificial intelligence; Construction industry; Decision making; Decision support systems; Analytic hierarchical process; Business contexts; Decision making criteria; Decision support system (dss); Funds management; Human-centered designs; Interpretability; Personal involvement; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086504300

The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030). Findings: It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time. Originality/value: The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties.

The four-year post-secondary program will result in a B.S. in Applied Engineering and Production Sciences. All traditional engineering major areas of specialization (e.g., M.E., E.E., I.E., etc.) are eliminated. The paper makes the case that, in all these areas, the engineering is essentially the same. The difference is the artificial focus on particular segments of the continuous physics or science spectrum. Unlike the traditional post-secondary engineering education model, this new model wraps an engineering college around a contract engineering business, or full service EMS company (electronic manufacturing services). This new postsecondary education architecture will provide the student with a real-world learning environment for a full four-year undergraduate engineering program. The students learn the traditional engineering theory and practical skills by participating in every aspect of the EMS business-hence, the phrase concurrent education. The professors in the school also lead project teams consisting of students and staff on the EMS production floor. The students will be compensated for their work in the EMS. The teaching staff will be employed by the business as well as the school. The paper presents the planned curriculum for the students' freshman year. The school utilizes the real world EMS classroom to provide an active learning environment. As the students progress through the program, typical textbook-taught engineering subjects such as, dynamics, motion control, analog and digital electronics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, material science, calculus, etc., will be taught by utilizing the EMS production equipment, product designs and manufacturing/assembly processes to teach the theory, coordinated with written supplements to the traditional engineering textbooks. The paper also presents the win-win-win relationship developed for the three entities that have an interest in the new educational model's construction: 1. The Capital Equipment Automation Industry: Automated electronic product production is extremely capital intensive. Companies providing their equipment to the 501(c)(3) business means the students will be learning on it. In addition, the EMS will showcase the equipment operating in a real world environment. The equipment manufacturers will be able to show potential customers their automation equipment in this setting. 2. The Companies That Have Their Products Assembled and Perhaps Designed by the EMS: There is no better education for future employees (the students) than their participation on the product team that is building those products. Formal employment contracts between the company and the students upon graduation will be available. 3. The Students (i.e., the school's customers): Being educated in a competitive, real world environment means the students will be exposed to leading edge design and production technology (e.g., advanced automation, artificial intelligence, meta process control, etc.) with their course work continually updated as the EMS business processes advance to stay competitive. The paper identifies and explores this self-updating nature of the curriculum to meet the needs of the business as a method to ensure the student is always receiving a leading edge education. The students will always bring this acquired state-of-the-art wisdom to their future real world employers, fulfilling Wordsworth's words that the child is father to the man. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","Artificial intelligence; Concurrent Education; EMS Business; Engineering curriculum; Engineering education excellence; Manufacturing competitiveness; Offshore manufacturing","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Calculations; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Electronics industry; Engineering education; Heat transfer; Heating equipment; Process control; Product design; Textbooks; Active learning environment; Electronic manufacturing services; Equipment manufacturers; Postsecondary education; Production equipments; Real world environments; Traditional engineerings; Undergraduate engineering programs; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095753688

The hallmark of this transformation is the effect of digital technologies such as Internet of Things, Robotics, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence and others on the way we make things and the way we do business. Unlike in earlier transformations, technological change is happening at an exponential rate; as a result, artifacts, knowledge, and expertise are becoming obsolete at a very fast rate. In this climate of exponential technological change as educators we need to ask hard questions, such as: Is the current system of engineering education appropriate for the current time? Are we behind our times by many decades? What should the new model of engineering education be? Should we have an Education 4.0 movement to go hand-in-hand with Industry 4.0? What would Education 4.0 look like? Naturally all of these are difficult questions to answer. We explore these questions critically and in the context of engineering education and discuss pockets of efforts that are underway in different corners of the education landscape to address these critical questions. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"3D printers; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Industry 4.0; Critical questions; Digital technologies; Exponential rates; Fast rate; Hand in hands; Industrial revolutions; Technological change; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091690209

The main assumption in research on interactions, so obvious that usually not stated by researchers, is that they are set between humans. The development of artificial intelligence forces the re-examination of this assumption. This paper aims to conceptualize business virtual assistants (BVAs), a type of intelligent agent, as either a boundary object or an actor within business interactions. Design/methodology/approach: Reference is made to the literature on business interactions, boundary objects and identity attribution to problematize the process of interpretation through which BVA obtains an identity. The ARA model and the model of interaction process is used to create a theoretical framework. Findings: This paper contributes to the literature on business interactions, and to the core of the IMP discussion, in three aspects. The first provides a framework to understand the phenomenon of an artificial entity as an interlocutor in business interactions. While doing that a new type of entity, BVA, is introduced. The second contribution is the exploration and augmentation of the concept of a business actor. The third calls attention to BVA as a boundary object. These issues are seen as essential to move forward the discussion about the meaning of business interaction in the near future.

Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research is based in systems theory, through which the impact of disruptive technology innovation cycles on business models is described for tactical and strategic utility. Findings: The advent of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is characterized by a convergence of multiple technological innovations including artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, smart buildings, autonomous agents, and automated decision-making. Industry 4.0 promises a future of discontinuities and disruptive innovation superseding the deployment of digital technologies enabled by Industry 3.0. Ambidextrous leaders need to maintain two concurrent foci: one on the current CRE business environment for incremental improvements and one on new opportunities made possible by the next technology innovation cycle. Practical implications: By anticipating the inflection points of nonlinear technology adoption cycles, CRE leaders can reduce risks and increase innovative opportunities as participants in the next disruptive cycle rather than falling victim to it. Originality/value: This work examines CRE market disruptions caused by technology innovation cycles through the lens of systems theory. A connection is made between the nonlinear nature of technology disruption cycles within the CRE business environment and how CRE leadership can better anticipate and prepare for change through ambidextrous thinking. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business environment; Complexity; Disruption; Resiliency; Sustainability; Technological innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082705374

The latest literature on the connection between AI and marketing has emphasized a great variety of AI applications that qualify this relationship. Based on these studies but focusing only on the applications with a direct impact on the relationship at the very heart of marketing, i.e., the one between firms and consumers, the paper analyzes three categories of AI applications: AI-based shipping-then-shopping, AI-based service robots, and AI-based smart products and domestic robots. The main result of this first analysis is that all three categories have to do, each in their own way, with mass customization. A discussion of this common trait leads us to recognize their ways to mass customization that - unlike the traditional approach developed thanks to flexible automation and product modularity technologies - place the customization process within a broader perspective of consumer needs management. This change in approach means that marketing should focus more on managing consumers' needs than directly on the satisfaction of those needs. This finding marks a genuine discontinuity that opens up a new space for reflection for scholars and marketing managers alike. © 2020 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Industry 4.0, building on the integration of information and communication technologies, Internet of things, robotics, additive manufacturing, and artificial intelligence, aims for developing autonomous and dynamic operations to enable the mass production of highly customized products. Industry 4.0 and quality management share the same objective, that is, improving process performance, yet through different trajectories. However, notwithstanding Industry 4.0 developments, quality management models have remained stagnant and failed to keep abreast of these advancements. This paper evaluates the alignment of quality management models with Industry 4.0. The paper shows that quality models are not congruent with Industry 4.0. The former build on the paradigm that supports establishing formal systems, compliance with specifications, and meeting requirements which are quite irrelevant to Industry 4.0. The paper compares the features of Industry 4.0 against quality models, highlights inadequacies in quality models, and develops recommendations for future quality models.

Due to the large volume of databases today, the expected duplicate detection algorithms need to be not only accurate but also practical, which means that it can release the detection results as fast as possible for a given request. Among existing algorithms for the deduplicate detection problem, using Siamese neural networks with the triplet loss has become one of the robust ways to measure the similarity of two entities (texts, paragraphs, or documents) for identifying all possible duplicated items. In this paper, we first propose a practical framework for building a duplicate detection system in a SaaS platform. Second, we present a new active learning schema for training and updating duplicate detection algorithms. In this schema, we not only allow the crowd to provide more annotated data for enhancing the chosen learning model but also use the Siamese neural networks as well as the triplet loss to construct an efficient model for the problem. Finally, we design a user interface of our proposed deduplicate detection system, which can easily apply for empirical applications in different companies. © 2020 ACM.","Active learning; Datasets; Duplicate removal; Triplet loss","Artificial intelligence; Signal detection; User interfaces; Active Learning; Detection problems; Detection system; Duplicate detection; Learning models; Multi-national corporations; SaaS (software as a service); Saas platforms; Software as a service (SaaS)",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086897997

The general applicability and precision of analytical tools in artificial intelligence and machine learning have driven organisations to leverage these advances to process personal data in new and innovative ways. As stewards of personal data, organisations need to keep that data safe and ensure processing is legal and appropriate. Having more data, however, has also led to an increased interest to process personal data for purposes other than why they were originally collected, known as secondary purposes. The reuse of personal data introduces important regulatory challenges, increasing the need to disassociate data used for secondary purposes from personal data, be it to safeguard the data, support a legitimate interest, or anonymise the data. Whereas some academics have focused on specific issues preventing more widespread adoption of this privacy-enhancing technology, others have reframed the discussion around anonymisation as risk management. Combining technology-enabled processes with measures of identifiability provides an opportunity to meet complex business needs while ensuring best practice is adopted in reusing sensitive data. This paper examines these many considerations and demonstrates how risk-based anonymisation can and should be detailed, evidence based and objectively supported through measures of identifiability. The engineering of privacy solutions, through the application of risk-based anonymisation, is also briefly explored for complex use cases involving data lakes and hub and spoke data collection, to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of real-world riskbased anonymisation in practice. © Henry Stewart Publications 2398-1679 (2020).","Anonymisation; De-identification; Privacy engineering; Pseudonymisation; Secondary uses",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111047867

In the traditional economy, the identification of the place of tax residence of companies usually does not create interpretative problems. However, the dynamic development of the digital economy raises questions as to whether the concept of the place of effective management (POEM) is also an appropriate instrument for companies. It is used as a tie-breaker rule and national residence test based on the axiom of one location of the place where major decisions are made that affect the functioning of the enterprise as a whole. However, due to the growing importance of data collection, processing, and monetization processes – with the intensive use of advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence – it changes hierarchical, linear management models and implements an approach based on decentralization and dispersion of decision-making processes. The considerations contained in this article also pertain to the issue of the desirability of developing a tax connector other than the POEM from the perspective of examining the nature of the economic relationships of ‘digital companies’ with the state for the purposes of tax law. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","algorithmic management; Corporate tax residence; digital business models; dual residence; international taxation; internet; tax avoidance; tax risk",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100685186

In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, computer vision technology has been gradually used for fruit grading, resulting in a great reduction in labor costs and considerable business benefits. In our study, an intelligent system of apple grading was designed using 1089 data samples of apple, and three features (shape, color, and texture) were chosen as the input indicators (145 dimensions). The importance of model features (color, shape, and texture) was evaluated through quantifying the relationship between the features by using the boost algorithms. Our results showed that recognition effect based on fusion features was better than single feature, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm performed the best for apple grading, whose recognition accuracy reached up to 87.2% and AUC (area under curve) value reached 0.959 using the ensemble learning methods. At present, there are few reports about using the XGBoost algorithm to classify apple grades, and our research indicated that the XGBoost algorithm can be employed to rank apples with high classification accuracy and strong generalization ability, which provided innovative ideas and technical directions for fruit grading in future. © 2020, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

In general, process mining can be separated into three classes: process discovery, conformance checking and process enhancement. In order to simplify the process model, we make an assumption that both events in the log and tasks in the model have an injective relation in process mining, i.e., do not allow two tasks to share the same label (thus duplicates task). In addition, Duplicate tasks have some issues concerning the quality of process model discovered and the potential indeterminism in conformance checking. In this paper, we perform a systematic literature review of process discovery and conformance checking metrics for duplicate tasks. This review can: (1) provide a comprehensive review of the current work of duplicate tasks in process discovery and conformance checking; (2) help researchers choose proper process mining approach, tools, and metrics; (3) identify research opportunities in duplicate tasks. © 2020 IEEE.","conformance checking; duplicate tasks; process discovery; process mining; systematic literature reviewe","Artificial intelligence; Business Process; Conformance checking; Process Discovery; Process enhancements; Process execution; Process Modeling; Research opportunities; Systematic literature review; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092199250

Moreover it makes up the deficiencies of the traditional finance on the aspects of satisfaction of the wider populations on financial demands, enhancement of financial inclusiveness and improvement of financial service efficiency. However Internet finance is also a double-edged sword. As a new pattern and new mode in the financial field, the prevailing laws, policies and regulatory systems can not completely cover the risk vulnerabilities of internet finance. This paper adopted the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and five quantitative representative influential factors to compare the risk. According to the empirical analysis, the first higher risk in the current internet finance of China is credit risk; following which, the risks are the business risk, legal risk and operational risk; therefore it is very necessary to launch effective regulation and supervision on the risks of Chinese internet finance from multiple aspects, such as credit system, laws and regulations, regulatory systems so as to promote the mutual development of internet finance and traditional finance; this is the core issue of Chinese internet finance development. © 2020 IEEE.","fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; internet finance; risk assessment","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Efficiency; Finance; Laws and legislation; Capital allocation; Empirical analysis; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Influential factors; Laws and regulations; Market competition; Mutual development; Regulatory systems; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092167568

To meet these challenges many are looking to industry 4.0 technology as a solution, specifically the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in-field robotics. Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo'd technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders. The time constrained SoS discovery process consists of raising awareness, capturing data, modelling the SoS, modelling the System of Interest (SoI) and providing recommendations, often based on common challenges and opportunities from the SoS Canvas. The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS.

Retailers are growing better approaches to associate with clients and client channels. It is predicted that in the coming years the Internet will be playing a much crucial job to regular day to day existence. Soon we will be living in a world where non-living objects are connected with each other and have computing capabilities, hence creating so-called 'smart objects'. This smart component across a wide range of technologies and services is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Literature shows that retailers are regularly more connectors of advancement, as opposed to innovate themselves. They are centered around making new products, as opposed to developing their services. The idea of service-based advancement is a fairly under searched territory. This paper focuses around how the Internet of Things permits retailers to improve their services in new manners by taking a gander at the key drivers of advancement in the retail business. Based on extensive literature review and experts inputs it can be concluded that the Internet of Things is very extensive tool to enhance innovation in the service-based retail industry.

The paper is conceptual as it discusses the fundamentals behind this idea, synthesises the knowledge of technology, and presents it in a new context. It is based on the author's considerations and the literature review, which contributes to the insight into the basic understanding of RPA technology as well as systematises and clarifies RPA definitions, identifies market trends, formulates a set of predictions for further development of this technology, and highlights directions for future inquiry. Additionally, logical arguments are proposed for considering RPA as a technology that enables and advances digital transformation. Moreover, criteria are indicated for business processes suitable for RPA. Nowadays, the robotisation of business processes a s innovative technology is more often practically implemented than it is investigated by research. Published papers outline real examples of implemented cases of RPA technology in organisations that mainly represent service industries. These case studies allow identifying possible advantages and risks derived from RPA implementation. Recent studies also report benefits of the RPA application in terms of productivity, costs, service quality, and error reduction. Some authors propose the criteria for selecting processes suitable for automation and robotisation. This paper constitutes a foundation for new research aimed at filling knowledge gaps in this area.

A two-phase model is proposed; the first phase predicts loan rejection, while the second one predicts default risk for approved loans. LR was found to be the best performer for the first phase, with test set recall macro score of 77.4%. DNNs were applied to the second phase only, where they achieved best performance, with test set recall score of 72%, for defaults. This shows that artificial intelligence can improve current credit risk models reducing the default risk of issued loans by as much as 70%. The models were also applied to loans taken for small businesses alone. The first phase of the model performs significantly better when trained on the whole dataset. Instead, the second phase performs significantly better when trained on the small business subset. This suggests a potential discrepancy between how these loans are screened and how they should be analysed in terms of default prediction. © 2020 The Authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; default risk; financial automation; peer-to-peer lending",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089109513

Traditional artificial modeling method is time-consuming with instable accuracy. The process recommendation technique can improve the intelligence and efficiency of process modeling. However, most of the existing recommendation-based process modeling methods focus on the process structure and neglect the behavior. In fact, two process models with the same structure may contain different behaviors. Thus, a recommendation-based process modeling method was proposed in terms of behavior, which provided a set of related task nodes to users and helped them efficiently model a process. The reference process being modeled and all process models in the repository were transformed into the process structure trees. Then, the independent paths that represented the behaviors of these process models were extracted. The similarities of independent paths between the reference process and each process model in the repository were calculated, the top k independent paths in the repository were selected and the next nodes of the current nodes in these independent paths were recommended. If the independent paths in the repository were same with the independent path of reference process, their respect path weight were calculated and the larger one was preferentially recommended. Based on the proposed method, a visual prototype system that allowed users to visually model a process was implemented based on the recommendation results. The proposed method was compared with the existing method in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and the experiment results showed that the proposed method could meet the practical applications. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Based on the analyses of 41 articles, we propose a three-stage typology of decision-making frameworks to understanding RL supplier selection, including (a) establishment of the selection criteria; (b) calculation of the relative weights and ranking of the selection criteria; (c) ranking of alternatives (suppliers). The main discoveries of this review are as follows. (1) Attention to the field of RL supplier selection is increasing, as evidenced by the increasing number of papers in the field. With the adaption of circular economy legislation and the need resource and business resilience, it is expected that RL and RL supplier selection will be a hot topic in the near future. (2) A large number of papers take ""sustainability"" as the theoretical approach to carry out research and use it as the basis for determining the criteria. (3) Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been widely used in RL supplier selection and have been constantly innovated. (4) Artificial intelligence methods are also gradually being applied. Finally, gaps in the literature are identified to provide directions for future research.

Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still ""open"" in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field. Especially, the study has been conducted following two phases: firstly, we extracted from scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and studied relevant articles; secondly, we analyzed the selected articles. The findings highlight interesting issues about AI towards a ""space economy"" to achieve sustainable and responsible business models, also in the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental awareness; Environmental space; Literature review; Space economy; Stakeholder","artificial intelligence; business development; environmental assessment; farming system; numerical model; scenario analysis; stakeholder; supply chain management; sustainability; technology adoption; Scopus",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087522323

In business, HPC is used to enhance the product delivery time, reduce the production cost, and decrease the time it takes to develop a new product. Today's high level of computing power from supercomputers comes at the expense of consuming large amounts of electric power. It is necessary to consider reducing the energy required by the computing systems and the resources needed to operate these computing systems to minimize the energy utilized by HPC entities. The database could improve system energy efficiency by sampling all the components' power consumption at regular intervals and the information contained in a database. The information stored in the database will serve as input data for energy-efficiency optimization. More so, device workload information and different usage metrics are stored in the database. There has been strong momentum in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for optimizing and processing automation by leveraging on already existing information. This paper discusses ideas for improving energy efficiency for HPC using AI. © 2020 by the authors.

Modeling risks through the characteristics of the historical data of an insurance business, such as premium income, dividends and reinvestments, can usually produce an integral dierential equation that is satisfied by the ruin probability. However, the distribution function of the claim inter-arrival times is more complicated, which makes it dicult to find an analytical solution of the ruin probability. Therefore, based on the principles of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we propose a novel numerical method for solving the ruin probability equation. The initial asset u is used as the input vector and the ruin probability as the only output. A trigonometric exponential function is proposed as the projection mapping in the hidden layer, then a block trigonometric exponential neural network (BTENN) model with a symmetrical structure is established. Trial solution is set to meet the initial value condition, simultaneously, connection weights are optimized by solving a linear system using the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. Three numerical experiments were carried out by Python. The results show that the BTENN model can obtain the approximate solution of the ruin probability under the classical risk model and the Erlang(2) risk model at any time point. Comparing with existing methods such as Legendre neural networks (LNN) and trigonometric neural networks (TNN), the proposed BTENN model has a higher stability and lower deviation, which proves that it is feasible and superior to use a BTENN model to estimate the ruin probability. © 2020 by the authors.","Block trigonometric exponential function; Neural network; Numerical solution; Ruin probability",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087444376

By using real-time measurements and artificial intelligence, it is possible to respond faster to changing conditions, while accurate and timely information permits rapid evaluation of changes and fast business improvement decisions. This article presents a blueprint for alignment of systems, organizational design, and management practices to leverage these developments in performance-driven operations management in mining and mineral processing. The first component of the blueprint is a performance framework with a system of key performance indicators for production control that can be used across organizational levels. This system places improvement at the core of management activities, giving greater importance to improvement skills at lower organizational levels, so companies can leverage available information for improving operational control. Secondly, the blueprint defines an organizational structure that strengthens performance improvement with technological and change management capabilities. Finally, the blueprint proposes alignment of management practices, covering the optimization of short-interval controls, the application of an improvement project portfolio management system that determines the ownership of improvement projects, and the coordination of controls across the organization. This combination of systems, organizational design, and management alignment supports rapid decision-making at the right organizational level.

Because few enterprises can successfully graduate from the incubation process in one incubation period, the incubating enterprises will be carried over to the successive periods. In this context, the number of incubating enterprises can be regarded as a carry-over variable linking different incubation periods, which can also be treated as an undesirable output in the current period. This paper proposes a dynamic slacks-based measure model to evaluate the efficiency of China's state-level business incubators during 2010–2012. The empirical results show that neglecting new entrants and the typical carry-over variable may underestimate the incubation system's efficiency. Moreover, the operational efficiency of China's state-level business incubators is relatively low, which is largely caused by the lower pure technical efficiency. There exist great disparities between pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency for all considered incubators in China. Some important insights and policy suggestions are presented.

Does it matter if the expert belongs to our in-group? And, what, if anything, would change if an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system was the recommender rather than a human expert? In order to answer these research questions, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment, informed by MAIN Model (Sundar, 2008), which posits that interface cues signaling different types of sources can influence perceived credibility of content by triggering distinct cognitive heuristics. Participants were assigned to a scenario wherein the expert review contrasted the peer rating about recommending photos for business profiles, with systematic variations in expert review valence (negative vs. positive), expert identity (ingroup vs. outgroup vs. no identity), and agent type (human vs. AI). Results show that positive ratings are more influential on user judgements. However, for negative ratings, human ingroup members generated greater effects than no-identity experts. Moreover, AI systems were as influential as human experts, suggesting the potential for AI to substitute human experts for online recommendations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Expert vs. peer; Group identity; MAIN model; Online rating; Social influence","Artificial intelligence; Online systems; Social aspects; Expert recommendations; Expert vs. peer; Group identities; On-line experiments; Online ratings; Research questions; Social influence; Systematic variation; Economic and social effects; adult; article; artificial intelligence; female; heuristics; human; human experiment; male; signal transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078896625

Across domains, companies experience rapid changes to their existing practices due to new technologies and new entrants that current businesses. While digitalization brings endless opportunities, it comes with challenges that require companies to strategically engage with partners in their surrounding ecosystems. In this paper, we study how companies in the embedded systems domain experience the process of transitioning from product-based companies to businesses where software, data, and artificial intelligence (AI) play an increasingly important role. To manage this, these companies need to evolve their existing ecosystems while at the same time create new ecosystems around new technologies. This involves maintaining existing technologies such as mechanics and electronics while at the same time expanding these with software, data, and AI. We provide a strategic decision framework that helps software-intensive embedded systems companies to successfully navigate the digital transformation. We do this in two steps. First, we present three models that provide the technical content of the strategic decision framework. Second, we provide an overview of the strategic alternatives that incumbents and new entrants have available when existing technologies are commoditizing and new technologies are introduced. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","digitalization; existing and new technologies; incumbents and new entrants; software and business ecosystems; software-intensive embedded systems; strategies","Ecosystems; Business ecosystem; Digital transformation; digitalization; incumbents and new entrants; Strategic decisions; strategies; Technical content; Three models; Embedded systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078594530

It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management (OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability, as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves performance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal.

To improve IT service management (ITSM) processes, a software-mediated process assessment method is proposed with four phases: process identification, process assessment, process capability measurement and process improvement. The international standard for process assessment was applied to measure process capability. This method was trialled at two Australian organisations and positively evaluated in a US foreign exchange trading business. Our empirical evidence challenges the underlying assumption that higher levels of process capability depend on the achievement of lower level process attributes. We conclude that this method can be applied to transparently self-assess processes. © 2019","Decision support system; Design science research; IT service management; Process assessment; Staged maturity model; Task technology fit","Artificial intelligence; Design-science researches; IT service management; Maturity model; Process assessments; Task technology fit; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072700000

We descriptively code over 1000 German tweets and build eight distinct classification models, so that a resulting artifact can independently determine the probabilities of a tweet containing each of the eight previously defined needs. To increase the scope of application, we deploy the machine learning models as part of a web service for public use.

Analysis of x-ray images in medical applications, cyber security data, crime data, telecommunications and stock market data, health records and business analytics data are but a few areas of interest. Applications and platforms including R, RapidMiner and Weka provide the basis for analysis, often used by practitioners who pay little to no attention to the underlying mathematics and processes impacting the data. This often leads to an inability to explain results or correct mistakes, or to spot errors. Applied Data Analytics - Principles and Applications seeks to bridge this missing gap by providing some of the most sought after techniques in big data analytics. Establishing strong foundations in these topics provides practical ease when big data analyses are undertaken using the widely available open source and commercially orientated computation platforms, languages and visualisation systems. The book, when combined with such platforms, provides a complete set of tools required to handle big data and can lead to fast implementations and applications. The book contains a mixture of machine learning foundations, deep learning, artificial intelligence, statistics and evolutionary learning mathematics written from the usage point of view with rich explanations on what the concepts mean. The author has thus avoided the complexities often associated with these concepts when found in research papers. The tutorial nature of the book and the applications provided are some of the reasons why the book is suitable for undergraduate, postgraduate and big data analytics enthusiasts. This text should ease the fear of mathematics often associated with practical data analytics and support rapid applications in artificial intelligence, environmental sensor data modelling and analysis, health informatics, business data analytics, data from Internet of Things and deep learning applications. © 2020 River Publishers.","Artificial neural networks; Convolutional neural networks; Data analytics; Digital identity management system; Kalman filters; Markov chain; Moment generating functions; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; Probabilistic neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Vector machines",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106566223

Given that strategies leading to energy sustainability have become a key aspect of business competitiveness, decision makers in small and medium-sized enterprises could clearly benefit from a new approach that provides a better understanding of energy-change impacts on their business activities. The present study combined fuzzy cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to develop an informed, transparent model for use in analyses of energy-change effects on the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises. This dual methodology facilitated an examination of cause-and-effect relationships between decision criteria and the clarification of dynamic interactions between variables from a holistic, real-world perspective, thereby enriching the extant literature.

Design/methodology/approach: The approach was to carry out a literature review and to consult with marketing experts who were invited to contribute to the paper. Findings: There is little research into applying AI to strategic marketing decision-making. This research is needed, as the frontier of AI application to decision-making is moving in many management areas from operational to strategic. Given the competitive nature of such decisions and the insights from applying AI to defence and similar areas, it is time to focus on applying AI to strategic marketing decisions. Research limitations/implications: The application of AI to strategic marketing decision-making is known to be taking place, but as it is commercially sensitive, data is not available to the authors. Practical implications: There are strong implications for all businesses, particularly large businesses in competitive industries, where failure to deploy AI in the face of competition from firms, who have deployed AI to improve their decision-making could be dangerous. Social implications: The public sector is a very important marketing decision maker. Although in most cases it does not operate competitively, it must make decisions about making different services available to different citizens and identify the risks of not providing services to certain citizens; so, this paper is relevant to the public sector. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first papers to probe deployment of AI in strategic marketing decision-making. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Decision-making; Marketing; Operations; Planning; Strategy",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083669734

The last decade has seen the proliferation of academic papers, consultancy reports and news articles about the possible effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on work-creating visions of both utopian and dystopian workplace futures. AI has the potential to transform the demand for labour, the nature of work and operational infrastructure by solving complex problems with high efficiency and speed. However, despite hundreds of reports and studies, AI remains an enigma, a newly emerging technology, and its rate of adoption and implications for the structure of work are still only beginning to be understood. The current anxiety about labour displacement anticipates the growth and direct use of AI. Yet, in many ways, at present AI is likely being overestimated in terms of impact. Still, an increasing body of research argues the consequences for work will be highly uneven and depend on a range of factors, including place, economic activity, business culture, education levels and gender, among others. We appraise the history and the blurry boundaries around the definitions of AI. We explore the debates around the extent of job augmentation, substitution, destruction and displacement by examining the empirical basis of claims, rather than mere projections. Explorations of corporate reactions to the prospects of AI penetration, and the role of consultancies in prodding firms to embrace the technology, represent another perspective onto our inquiry. We conclude by exploring the impacts of AI changes in the quantity and quality of labour on a range of social, geographic and governmental outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).","Artificial Intelligence; automation; bias in machine learning; geography of technology; job displacement and growth","artificial intelligence; computer simulation; labor market; labor supply; machine learning; organizational framework; technological change; technological development; workplace",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084386238

Such statistical models have been criticized in the existing literature especially for producing cultural biases and for challenging our notions of knowledge. However, few studies have contributed to an essential understanding of the way in which algorithms are designed with particular truths to enable systematic decision-making. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a Scandinavian AI company, this article analyzes how truth is built through layered interpretative practices in applied AI for healthcare, and critically assesses how such practices shed light on the pragmatic notion of truth(s) in AI. The study identifies five practices that all show difficulty in modeling fuzzy patient conditions into one firm truth. The key contribution is that truth goes from being a process of discovering a more ‘right’ truth to become a process of reinventing the existing truth and healthcare practice. These findings suggest that truth in applied AI is a key devise for making predictive algorithms a viable business, and that developers are in a favorable position to make not only AI doable but also the very truth they intend to find and model. The study in this way shows how change is an inherent part of making AI systems, and that centralizing truth practices is a fruitful way of analyzing such changes and developers’ agency. We argue for analytical awareness of how AI truth practices may prompt a world that is fit to algorithms rather than a world to which algorithms are fit. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithm studies; Artificial intelligence; automation; ground truth; knowledge production; machine learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084259445

Then, we analyze the specialization of this concept and algorithm in Yelp and we extract several knowledge patterns about Yelp k-bridges. In particular, we investigate how some basic characteristics of Yelp k-bridges vary against k (i.e., against the number of macro-categories which the businesses reviewed by them belong to). Then, we verify if there exists an influence exerted by k-bridges on their friends and/or on their co-reviewers. We also analyze the relationship between k-bridges and power users. In addition, we investigate the relationship between k-bridges and the main centrality measures in the macro-categories of Yelp. We also propose two further specializations of k-bridges, regarding Reddit and the network of patent inventors, to prove that the knowledge on k-bridges we initially found in Yelp is not limited to this social network.

The rise of fintech driven by nonbank entities (technology startups, finance, big tech and big retail companies) helps to transform financial services industry, but also threatens the market positions of traditional banks and through them potentially the stability of the financial system. The current EU proposals, as presented in the Commission’s Fintech Action Plan published in 2018 and follow-up measures, outlined a number of steps to support fintech, while ensuring the protection of market stability and consumers and the maintenance of level playing field in the financial services markets. The article argues that, while the Commission’s proposed policy mix contains certain positive measures for fintech, it remains, overall, conservative and favours the incumbents. It also argues that unless the Commission becomes bolder and adopts a more flexible legal framework for fintech (for which the article makes specific recommendations), the latter will not grow at the pace needed to help build a competitive advantage for the EU financial sector.

The focus is around removing the human from the loop, thus increasing the overall process efficiency. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence allow us to start to automate tasks performed by specialized human beings, such as: visual inspection and defect detection. In this visual inspection process a deep convolutional neural network is used to fulfill the task of visual inspection of a bearing mounting process and classify it into 2 classes: good or faulty. This process is characteristic to the automotive sector. After training the CNN model the performances are evaluated by running the classification part of the algorithm on the validation dataset. No special training constraints are used and no special training method are used: everything is open source, as the goal of this research is to prove the viability for smaller companies to use AI in their everyday processes, in order to improve the overall business efficiency. The model can replace the human operator in the loop by having a mean accuracy of 90% and a mean processing time of 8 seconds. The overall cost of this application was well under the general market price for this kind of solutions. A path for further improvements is also demonstrated. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Agricultural robots; Automotive industry; Bearing mountings; Classification (of information); Convolution; Costs; Deep neural networks; Defects; Efficiency; Inspection; Robotics; Automotive sector; Business efficiency; Defect detection; Mean processing time; Modern advancement; Overall process efficiencies; Visual inspection; Visual recognition; Convolutional neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089564122

Despite recent advances in important domains such as device health maintenance and manufacturing process, the conventional architecture does not offer a satisfactory solution for rapidly providing data models, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge. In this work, we employ ideas from distributed network based on digital twins and from recent advances that augment artificial intelligent with big data. Our architecture provides a paradigm that uses a distributed network makes computer programming, software, and data spread out across more than one terminal, but communicate complex messages through terminal nodes, and are dependent upon each other, obviating the pressure from master station. We demonstrate the usefulness of digital twins that are used to track the performance of devices such as transformer during normal operation to detect possible defects and fix them before they result in failure.

While Artificial intelligence is a simulation of the cognitive approach, RPA is merely mimicking that process by the use of bots. RPA and IA are emerging and transforming businesses across various sectors such as finance and accounting, payroll, human resources, supply chain, customer service, sales and marketing, IT etc.[5] One such industry where bots are being used for automating processes is the food and lifestyle industry. Various applications like healthify me and room suggest users a diet based on their specifications like height, weight, age, gender etc. Some of these applications make use of E-mail automation to suggest users with a user-specific, specially curated diet at timed intervals(daily/weekly/monthly.). Various tools such as Automation Anywhere, Blue prism, UI-Path, Pega etc.[4] are used to create bots and automate tasks/compute algorithms. The tool used for the creation of this diet recommendation system is Automation Anywhere. By making use of automation anywhere, a recommender system is created that can act as a meal planner. There are three types of bots in Automation Anywhere-task bots, meta bots and IQ bots. Task bots need to be edited manually with application updates. Metabots on the other hand, are more advanced. They are designed in such a way that bot-recalibration is automatically applied with changes in the application interface. IQ bots use cognitive technology when working with unstructured data[11]. Here, For this particular application, taskbots and metabots are used.

Furthermore, the advances in machine learning capabilities leverage the natural language processing towards natural and straightforward dialogue experiences for industries. However, in the best of our knowledge, no literature review outlines conversational agents in the business industry, primarily taking into account computational learning capabilities. This article presents a systematic literature review that encompasses these areas looking through the use of machine learning to improve the field of business. The review followed a guideline for systematic reviews to present the literature of the last decade, emphasizing business perspectives such as domains, goals, and challenges, and computational methods for self-learning, personalization, and response generation of conversational agents. As a result, the article provides the answers of three general, three focused, and two statistical questions to address the role of artificial intelligence in conversational agents applied to business domains. In this regard, the results show that no study combines self-learning, personalization, and generative-based responses for the same business solution. Additionally, the article describes the organization of the state-of-the-art, highlighting the correlation of business perspectives and machine learning methods.

In this paper, a forecasting method is proposed, which has a strong capability of predicting highly fluctuating demand data. Therefore, in this paper we propose a demand forecasting method based on multi-layer LSTM networks. The proposed method automatically selects the best forecasting model by considering different combinations of LSTM hyperparameters for a given time series using the grid search method. It has the ability to capture nonlinear patterns in time series data, while considering the inherent characteristics of non-stationary time series data. The proposed method is compared with some well-known time series forecasting techniques from both statistical and computational intelligence methods using demand data of a furniture company. These methods include autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), support vector machines (SVM) and single layer LSTM. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior among the tested methods in terms of performance measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand prediction; LSTM; RNN; Statistical methods; Time series forecasting","Autoregressive moving average model; Competition; Forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Network layers; Statistical methods; Support vector machines; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Computational intelligence methods; Demand prediction; Inherent characteristics; LSTM; Non-stationary time series; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Time series forecasting; Long short-term memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082738708

This leads to a variety of responses, including “business as usual”, technological optimism, technological fatalism and technological ignorance. To explore this perplexity and its justification, we examine four areas of technological advance relevant to transport: mobility as a service; unmanned aerial vehicles (drones); automated vehicles; and telehealth. In each case, we identify the principal underlying shifts which are driving these technological advances, concluding that there is considerable overlap: three of the advances rely on ubiquitous sensing and on artificial intelligence and all four rely, to some degree, on connectedness. We then explore these three “drivers”, finding that progress is steadier than may be generally thought. We discuss the implications for our set of transport-related technological developments, concluding that policy makers could approach the future with greater confidence than is currently typical. They could also draw on the concepts of anticipatory governance to support their management of emerging technology and, at the same time, of the influence of external actors. © 2020","AVs; Drones; Futures; Governance; MaaS; Technology","Antennas; Decision making; Drones; Medical computing; Automated vehicles; Business-as-usual; Emerging technologies; Futures; Governance; MaaS; Technological advances; Technological development; Artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence; automation; conceptual framework; future prospect; governance approach; policy approach; technological development; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy; unmanned vehicle",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081539974

As the Internet becomes more deeply integrated into our business operations through IoT platform, the desire for reliable and efficient connections increases as well. Fog and Cloud security is a topical issue associated with every data storage, managing or processing paradigm. Attacks once occurred, have ineradicable and disastrous effects on the development of IoT, Fog, Cloud computing. Therefore, many security systems/models have been proposed and/or implemented for the sake of Fog security. Intrusion detection systems are one of the premier choices especially ones that designed using artificial intelligence. In our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for Fog security against cyber-attacks. The proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for Fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and IoT devices. We demonstrated our proposed model using a balanced version of the challenging dataset: NSL-KDD.

Novelty detection aims to identify observations that deviate from a determined normal behaviour. Only instances of one class are known, whereas so called novelties are unlabelled. Traditional novelty detection applies methods from the field of outlier detection. These standard one-class classification approaches have limited performance in many real business cases. The traditional techniques are mainly developed for industrial problems such as machine condition monitoring. When applying these to human behaviour, the performance drops significantly. This paper proposes a method that improves existing approaches by creating semi-synthetic novelties in order to have labelled data for the two classes. Expert knowledge is incorporated in the initial phase of this data generation process. The method was deployed on a real-life test case where the goal was to detect fraudulent subscriptions to a telecom family plan. This research demonstrates that the two-class expert model outperforms a one-class model on the semi-synthetic dataset. In a next step the model was validated on a real dataset. A fraud detection team of the company manually checked the top predicted novelties. The results show that incorporating expert knowledge to transform a one-class problem into a two-class problem is a valuable method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Analytics; Decision support systems; Expert knowledge; Novelty detection; One-class classification","Artificial intelligence; Condition monitoring; Decision support systems; Gears; Analytics; Expert knowledge; Machine condition monitoring; Novelty detection; One-class Classification; One-class problems; Standard procedures; Traditional techniques; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074814083

Students will examine the impact of external macro-environmental factors that influence firm growth in an emerging market context. Using this case, students will learn how to apply a resource-based view to a firm’s offering by comparing and identifying the competitive advantage of the internal resources of the firm. Using this case, students can apply the principle of strategic fit by strategically analyzing the opportunities and threats in the external environment, while taking into account the firm’s internal strengths and weaknesses. Case overview/synopsis: This case outlines the strategic, macro-environmental and marketing challenges that the Cape Town-based private higher education institution, Red & Yellow Creative School of Business, faced as it entered its 25th year of existence. In 2019, Red & Yellow had its roots in industry and had done well historically to cement that bond through the creation of successful alumni and the constant innovation of its higher education offering. Two weeks before having to present a detailed five-year growth strategy plan to the board of directors, Rob Stokes, the Director and Chairman of Red & Yellow, was faced with a multitude of decisions pertaining to the sustainable growth of the school. Recent growth patterns showed that programs with lower profit margins, such as classroom-based full-time programs, had experienced double-digit growth while student numbers for higher gross profit offerings, such as online and executive education programs had started to decline. Another challenge that the school faced was the need for its students to future-proof their careers in a world where artificial intelligence and machine learning threatened their careers and jobs. As such, Red & Yellow was confronted with one central strategic problem: How to grow strategically in the short term while developing a sustainable and scalable growth strategy for the school in the long term. Complexity academic level: This case could work well as part of an executive education course, as well as a strategic management course for master’s degree or Master of Business Administration students.

In the case of bonds, financial institutions often need multiple types of data to back up their marketing of bonds to companies. However, it is difficult to collect data and has a large amount of analysis. Therefore, this article based on issuance of historical data, simplifying the model data needed, rely on the company recommended study on the relationship between the issuance of bonds. Bonds contain a variety of heterogeneous characteristics, which contain a wealth of information. Therefore, this paper adopts the recommendation method based on HIN. This paper improves from three aspects. First, a meaningful meta-path is designed and a constraint condition is added to the random walk strategy to make it conform to the application scenario in the financial field. Secondly, the generation strategy is designed to generate isomorphic sequence of node of target type. Thirdly, based on the same industry bond recommendation, this method solves the cold start problem of the company. This paper conducts experiments on real data sets, and experimental results show the effectiveness of this method, which will assist account managers to find business opportunities. © 2020 ACM.","bond recommendation; constrained random walk model; Heterogeneous network; network embedding","Finance; Heterogeneous networks; Application scenario; Business opportunities; Constraint conditions; Financial institution; Heterogeneous characteristic; Random walk strategies; Recommendation methods; Wealth of information; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092260508

Given the rampant development in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there has been a gap between the advances in the field and the ethical and legal frameworks governing the field. This poses a problem which is set to grow in severity as more and more businesses and organization start adopting machine learning models. These models are essentially black boxes with even their developers having little knowledge as to how they came up with the results/decisions they did. In high stake decisions, this poses a serious problem as it leads to questioning of the trust ability of the model. There are a number of interpretability methods for different types of models and algorithms ranging from surrogate models to visual techniques for neural networks. However, there is often a trade-off between interpretability and model accuracy i.e., the more accurate a model tends to be, the less interpretable it becomes. Through this paper, we aim to demonstrate that interpretability of a model can actually be used to increase the model accuracy. We aim to achieve this by using the generated insights to update the model hyper parameters and comparing the accuracy scores before and after the update. We have used a breast cancer prediction dataset which we obtained from http://kaggle.com. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to create a machine learning pipeline which improves the model accuracy using insights from interpretability. © 2020 SERSC.","Interpretability; Model accuracy; Neural networks; Surrogate models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084607333

Combining the power of Big data analytics (including AI) with existing and future urban water infrastructure represents a significant untapped opportunity for the operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of urban water infrastructure to achieve economic and environmental sustainability. However, such progress may catalyze socio-economic changes and cross sector boundaries (e.g., water service, health, business) as the appearance of new needs and business models will influence the job market. Such progress will impact the academic sector as new forms of research based on large amounts of data will be possible, and new research needs will be requested by the technology industrial sector.

In order to provide a preliminary discussion on the eco-design of AI and Big Data applications, the paper aims to map out the sources and topics to explore (1) the intersections of eco-design with AI and Big Data, and (2) the sustainable and eco-friendly design. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 236 articles gathered from the Web of Science (WoS) database, the paper has identified main research topics, publication outlets, research fronts, and intellectual bases and explored their inter-relationship and grouping. The leading application disciplines include construction & building technology, automation & control system, computer & information science, and business & economics. Multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary journals such as Sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Cities and Society have been proven to be more receptive to such eco-design research outputs. As the notion of eco-design of AI and Big Data applications is expected to be pertinent and relevant for designing greener strategies, products and services for green digital transformation, we argue that more concerted efforts must be made to advance both the theoretical and empirical research on the nascent topic among researchers, funding bodies, policy-makers and industry professionals. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Traditional manufacturing provided the setting for much of the early research on worker productivity. However, as we have now seen an inexorable shift towards more service driven economic output, especially in the industrialized economies, the research in operations management on worker productivity has also increasingly focused on services. This monograph will take stock of the literature in operations management on worker productivity. The research is not exhaustive but is meant to showcase some of the interesting and relevant papers that fall into a few key themes. Mainly, the individual worker is the focal unit of analysis, and the goal is to explore the various operational factors that allow the worker to become more productive. Key areas of emphasis include the behavioral microfoundations of productivity, the effect of peers and workplace dynamics, the design and organization of work, and ways to improve human capital. Although much is known about the drivers of worker productivity, much remains unexplored. Furthermore, looming changes to the modern workplace call for new ways to think about worker productivity. For example, artificial intelligence, new models of business, and novel workplace arrangements, all have important implications for the design and organization of the modern workplace, and for the roles and responsibilities of the knowledge worker. Collectively, these developments will continue to make worker productivity a rich and exciting area of research. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes. © 2019","Automated decision making; Belief-rule-base; Evidential reasoning; Explainable artificial intelligence; Interpretable machine learning; Loan underwriting","Automation; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Automated decision making; Belief rule base; Decision making process; Evidential reasoning; Hierarchical structures; Loan underwriting; Optimization algorithms; Underwriting process; Decision making",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075989564

In the field of artificial intelligence, model data (i.e. effective feature point data set) will be the key information and will be used frequently. However, these feature point datasets may be megabytes, auspicious, or even terahertz. Then, the performance of big data transaction in blockchain network will be a problem worthy of study. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain big data storage method based on IPFs. This method mainly solves the transaction performance problem of large text data in the blockchain network. The data larger than 100 megabytes are stored in IPFs to obtain the hash certificate of text. The hash code is the only transaction voucher in the blockchain network.

In terms of hotel discovery, access to information & ease of booking – the entire hotel booking experience has become much more convenient & accessible. With the latest technologies evolving, operations in the hospitality Industry have not only made business easier to run, it also provides services in a varied manner, whenever the benefiter in the world is just a single click. Smart hoteliers are continuously in the process of adopting integrated hospitality management solutions which can deploy predictive analytics to price the hospitality products & services as well as to promote a wide range of services across multiple channels. With the prior knowledge of guest, their demographic data, purchase behaviour, interest etc. hotels can effectively & efficiently price & promote their services across multiple customer segments through automated & data-driven enterprise solution. A key benefit of using digital technologies is that they produce a tremendous amount of data for travel companies. Numerous brands are integrating data driven tools & advanced analytics into their enterprise solutions to derive contextual insights through their interactions with both existing & potential customers. These tools can play a major role in helping brands deliver a satisfying experience to the customers, for activities that include booking hotel rooms or leisure services. Customers create data on multiple touch points through historical online searches, past bookings of hotels & flights, reviews, referrals etc. Greater the numbers of touch point, more detailed are the insights. When the volume of data comes from so many platforms, brands can find it intimidating to make sense of all this information & apply it productively. Thus, integrating data science & analytics can offer a brand huge dividend to the hospitality Industry. Through this paper, the researcher has tried to find about the influence of technological advancements, like use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML), and Internet of things (IOT) in the Hospitality Industry & the need to catch up with the changing technology to create customer delight. Now a day’s Travel and Hospitality Industry are adopting modern technology along with a high degree of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Actually AI provides travel brands with the perfect opportunity to enhance marketing, customer service, customer experience and increase retention. © 2020 SERSC.","We would like to encourage you to list your in this section",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084474215

For corporations it means rethinking strategies and auto-cannibalisation of business models. For policy-makers in manufacturing nations it is supposed to raise national competitiveness and bring manufacturing home, potentially blocking developing nations from creating jobs through attracting labour-intensive manufacturing. Its effects on work and employment are forecast to be complex, potentially heightening inequality by reducing demand for low levels of skills. South Africa has a significant skills shortage, due to failings in its education system, limiting the supply of managers, researchers and workers needed for 4IR. There are also problems of poor quality infrastructure, reflecting weak governance and state capture.

However, a formal definition of said correlation is not always known in certain topics, such as technological advancements and job offer disponibility. In this study, we aim to compare technology-related job offers such as Data Scientist and Artificial Intelligence (AI) designer on various cities in the US with their respective GDP. To this aim, we collect data from the Indeed website about said job offers in different US cities, as well as their respective GDP values retrieved from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) platform. Next we define a correlation matrix between job offers and GDP by metropolitan area, as well as implement a temporal analysis on the amount of said offers. Our results show an high increase in job offers on Machine Leaning (ML) compared to other jobs skills, in addition to establishing a strong positive correlation between Business Intelligence (BI), Data Analytics (DA) and Internet of Things (IoT) skills looked for in a metropolitan area with the GDP of said area. © 2020 IEEE.","GDP; Job Ads; Job Online; Text Mining","Artificial intelligence; Data Analytics; Data Science; Internet of things; Amount of information; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Correlation matrix; Gross domestic products; Internet of Things (IOT); Positive correlations; Technological advancement; Technological aspects; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089140447

However, due to the large scale of terminal access, complex business operation relationship, network system vulnerability and more and more loopholes, the traditional network security technology is difficult to ensure the security of the system. This paper proposes to solve the security problems caused by large-scale terminal access by using the certificate-free security mechanism based on domestic cryptography, so as to provide security guarantee for the construction of electricity internet of things. At the same time, in order to meet the security requirements of energy Internet information interaction, this paper proposes a decentralized key management idea to solve the traditional IBC (identity based Cryptograph) algorithm key update problem, improve the security management and control ability of the system, and comprehensively support the construction of world-class energy Internet enterprises with excellent competitiveness. © 2020 IEEE.","Component; Domestic password; Electricity internet of things; Identity authentication; Network security","Artificial intelligence; Chromium compounds; Competition; Cryptography; Data integration; Information management; Internet of things; Software engineering; Business operation; Identity based cryptographs; Network security technology; Security management; Security mechanism; Security problems; Security requirements; Technology-based; Network security",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088647427

A versatile execution environment is required, capable of running different workloads in different locations in the network. Cloud computing is the key paradigm that allows fostering this trending change. One interesting question to solve is to what extent those computing environments have to move towards the network edge. Some services can be enabled by environments with increased capillarity, while others can be implemented in environments with more relaxed constraints (e.g., in terms of latency). This paper explores this topic by differentiating service edge from physical network edge and proposing an architecture based on the ALTO server for assisting orchestration systems in discriminating the suitable environments for each service. We present a network-flow strategy for assigning services to infrastructure elements following those precepts, together with an initial scalability evaluation of the proposed assignment solution to show its feasibility. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Architecture-based; Assignment solutions; Computing environments; Differentiating services; Execution environments; Physical network; Programmability; Scalability evaluation; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086756279

Previous studies have just focused on the perspective of big data utilization in Industry 4.0 and neglected the role of business intelligence systems (BIS), especially in the T&A industry. The current study is one of the first to investigate the determinants of BIS adoption with an eye towards understanding how BIS can resolve sustainability issues in T&A companies with Industry 4.0 technologies. Methodology: A qualitative research approach is applied with 14 semi-structured in-depth interviews from 12 of the world's high-end T&A companies. The snowball and purposeful sampling strategy is used to select the participants. The qualitative content analysis technique is used to analyze the interview data. Results: The findings revealed various themes, such as sustainability issues in T&A companies, improved value creation processes with leading BI solutions, and perceived difficulties in the adoption of BIS. Major improvements are perceived in the apparel retail business because apparel companies are more prone to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies with advanced business intelligence (BI) solutions. The results prove the pivotal role of economic sustainability in the adoption of BIS and Industry 4.0 technologies in T&A companies. © 2020 by the authors.","Apparel industry; Business intelligence systems adoption; Industry 4.0; Sustainability; Textile industry","advanced technology; artificial intelligence; business development; industrial regulation; industrial technology; sustainability; textile industry",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083577069

Devices connected to the Internet is much more than the number of world population. However, it may face all kinds of attacks from the Internet easily for its accessibility. As we all know, most attacks against IoT devices are based on Web applications. So protecting the security of Web services can effectively improve the situation of IoT ecosystem. Conventional Web attack detection methods highly rely on samples, and artificial intelligence detection results are uninterpretable. Hence, this article introduced a supervised detection algorithm based on benign samples. Seq2Seq algorithm is been chosen and applied to detect malicious web requests. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is introduced to label the attack payload and highlight labeling abnormal characters. The results of experiments show that on the premise of training a benign sample, the precision of proposed model is 97.02%, and the recall is 97.60%. It explains that the model can detect Web attack requests effectively. Simultaneously, the model can label attack payload visually and make the model “interpretable.”. © The Author(s) 2020.","attack visualization; attention mechanism; autoencoder; IoT devices; Seq2Seq; Web attack detection","Artificial intelligence; Web services; Attention mechanisms; Detection algorithm; Internet of Things (IOT); Network attack; Technology-based; WEB application; Web requests; World population; Internet of things",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083561044

However, the nature of bank marketing data hindered the researchers in the process of finding a reliable analytical scheme. Various studies have attempted to improve the performance of Artificial Neural Networks in predicting clients' intentions but did not resolve the issue of imbalanced data. This research aims at improving the performance of predicting the willingness of bank clients to apply for a term deposit in highly imbalanced datasets. It proposes enhanced Artificial Neural Network models (i.e., cost-sensitive) to mitigate the dramatic effects of highly imbalanced data, without distorting the original data samples. The generated models are evaluated, validated, and consequently compared to different machine-learning models. A real-world telemarketing dataset from a Portuguese bank is used in all the experiments. The best prediction model achieved 79% of geometric mean, and misclassification errors were minimized to 0.192, 0.229 of Type I & Type II Errors, respectively. In summary, an interesting Meta-Cost method improved the performance of the prediction model without imposing significant processing overhead or altering original data samples. © 2020 by the authors.","Applied computational intelligence; Business analytics; Cost-sensitive analysis; Electronic direct marketing; MLP-ANN",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083435775

Due to the emerging digitalisation, manufacturing models are changing through the use of smart technologies, such as robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, etc. They are experiencing a new phase of automation that enables innovative and more efficient processes, products and services. The introduction of these novel business models demands new professional skills requirements in the workforce of the food industry. In this work, we introduce an industry-driven proactive strategy to achieve a successful digital transformation in the food sector. For that purpose, we focus on defining the current and near-future key skills and competencies demanded by each of the professional profiles related to the food industry. To achieve this, we generated an automated database of current and future professions and competencies and skills. This database can be used as a fundamental roadmap guiding the sector through future changes caused by Industry 4.0. The interest shown by the local sectorial cluster and related entities reinforce the idea.

Thus, they increase production configuration diversity, and this leads to increased cost and less efficiency. In order to improve the economy and efficiency of production, this paper proposes an intelligent type-decreased mass customized product configuration method with an improved fuzzy clustering algorithm that combines the Kano's model and social inertia. The Kano's model is improved, and social inertia is introduced into the product configuration to adapt to customer psychology and gain better configuration results.

While applying blockchain to manage IoT devices and associated big data, the blockchain itself suffers from abuse of decentralization from anonymous users. Specifically, it has been utilized to facilitate black market trades and illegal activities. Ateniese et al. proposed using the chameleon hash (CH) to derive redactable blockchain (EuroS&P), which works by embedding a trapdoor in the basic hash function so that block content can be rewritten without causing major hard forks. In short, the redacted block hash remains unchanged. However, there is lacking intelligent design where any mistakes observed in the chain can be corrected universally and automatically. This creates disincentives to use redactable blockchain (RB) for managing big data or any data-driven business mainly due to ineffective chain redaction. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose the notion of the self-redactable blockchain (SRB) to support intelligent execution of chain redaction. Specifically, we propose the first revocable chameleon hash (RCH) to power RB. It enables an ephemeral trapdoor for finding collision without any co-operation. Periodical expiration is applied to committed hash and an ephemeral trapdoor to prevent any abuses of redaction power. We instantiate how to use our RCH to build SRB as an intelligent trust-layer for IoT. We also give a rigorous analysis as well as comprehensive experiments to validate our proposals. The evidence showed that our proposal is secure and acceptably efficient for IoT devices. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Automatic redaction; blockchain; intelligence; Internet of Things (IoT)","Big data; Blockchain; Commerce; Hash functions; Trusted computing; Automatic redaction; Data processing and transmission; Heterogeneous devices; Illegal activities; intelligence; Intelligent designs; Internet of Things (IOT); Rigorous analysis; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078823345

EA modelling has become decisive to achieve models that accurately represents behaviour and assets of companies and lead them to make appropriate business decisions. Although EA representations can be manually modelled by experts, automatic EA modelling methods have been proposed to deal with drawbacks of manual modelling, such as error-proneness, time-consumption, slow and poor re-adaptation, and cost. However, automatic modelling is not effective for the most abstract concepts in EA like strategy or motivational aspects. Thus, companies are demanding hybrid approaches that combines automatic with manual modelling. In this context there are no clear relationships between the input artefacts (and mining techniques) and the target EA viewpoints to be automatically modelled, as well as relationships between the experts' roles and the viewpoints to which they might contribute in manual modelling. Consequently, companies cannot make informed decisions regarding expert assignments in EA modelling projects, nor can they choose appropriate mining techniques and their respective input artefacts. This research proposes a decision support system whose core is a genetic algorithm. The proposal first establishes (based on a previous literature review) the mentioned missing relationships and EA model specifications. Such information is then employed using a genetic algorithm to decide about automatic, manual or hybrid modelling by selecting the most appropriate input artefacts, mining techniques and experts. The genetic algorithm has been optimized so that the system aids EA architects to maximize the accurateness and completeness of EA models while cost (derived from expert assignments and unnecessary automatic generations) are kept under control. © 2020","ArchiMate; Enterprise Architecture; Genetic algorithm; Reverse engineering; Viewpoint","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Reverse engineering; Archimate; Automatic Generation; Business decisions; Decision making support system; Enterprise Architecture; Literature reviews; Model specifications; Viewpoint; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078442628

This non-exhaustive statement firmly clashes with the troubling evolution of the algorithmic society where artificial intelligence technologies govern the flow of information online according to opaque technical standards established by social media platforms. These actors are usually neither accountable nor responsible for contents uploaded or generated by the users. Nevertheless, online content moderation affects users’ fundamental rights and democratic values, especially since online platforms autonomously set standards for content removal on a global scale. Despite their crucial role in governing the flow of information online, social media platforms are not required to ensure transparency and explanation of their decision-making processes. Within this framework, this work aims to show how the liberal paradigm of protection of the right to free speech is no longer enough to protect democratic values in the digital environment, since the flow of information is actively organised by business interests, driven by profit-maximisation rather than democracy, transparency or accountability. The role of free speech is still paramount. However, the challenges raised by the algorithmic society leads to focus on enhancing the positive dimension of this fundamental right by introducing new users’ rights and transparency and accountability obligations for social media to inject democratic values in the digital environment. © 2019 Giovanni De Gregorio","Artificial intelligence; Content moderation; Democracy; Digital constitutionalism; Freedom of expression; Online platforms","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Transparency; Content moderation; Democracy; Digital constitutionalism; Freedom of expression; Online platforms; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075348198

The process of data analysis to obtain actionable information with the help of technological tools and software is termed as Business Intelligence. Now, data and information are treated as an important asset in an organization to impart quality and summarized knowledge for valuable, quick and effective decisions and to be the leader in their market segment. Large repositories of past databases are managed in organizations as Data Marts or/ and Data Warehouse (DW) which are continuously queried and searched by Data Mining (DM) tools for new patterns, insights and findings that aids not only in current decisions but also for future decisions, tactical and operational planning. A Decision Support system (DSS) is an automated tool that provides summary reports for judgements and actions in an organization. It acts as business performance software and helps the managers to take sound decisions by providing facts and figures in summary formats. It is extensively used in business and management to provide Executive dashboard, identification of negative trends and loopholes, better allocation of business resources and faster decision making.

The purpose of the interactive agent is to provide the interaction between the human and services improving the customer experience and optimizing the efficiency and by decreasing the cost of customer service. Interactive agents design approach typically involves intent classification entity extraction and action or response. Practically interactive agent can be implemented in the fields like insurance investments, wedding planning, travel agent, hospitals if a real estate business, education, consultant, legal guidance,etc. Main objective of any artificial interactive agent is to communicate in the same way as we could communicate with other human beings. Any sentence taken as an import by what should be wisely understood and a response will be generated or an action will be performed. Q and A system will give a response for the input sentence. It uses pattern matching techniques. Interactive agent gives for response and also perform a set of actions on the input sentence. To understand the import sentence and to perform an action intent classification and entity or entity extraction are done. This is done by using natural language processing in NLP and natural language understanding NLU. IA are evolving Technologies. Utilization of IA will gradually increase in the future.

Unlike academia and industries that have been at the forefront of automation for decades, government is a new player in the field, though an important one. We build systems that are used on a large scale, we collect data to inform policymakers. Using the example of the Household Budget Survey, we demonstrate how government agencies can apply Human-in-the-Loop AI to automate the production of official statistics. The aim is time and resource saving on repetitive, labour-intensive tasks which machines are good at, allowing humans to focus on value added tasks requiring flexibility and intelligence. One major challenge is the human factor. How will the users, who are accustomed to manual tasks, react to the complexity of AI? How should we design the interface to give them a good user experience? How do we measure success? Indeed, one key step towards production is to secure funding, which requires presenting potential success in a way that the stakeholder can understand. Stressing the importance of formulating problems from a practical business viewpoint, we hope to bridge the communication gap and help the research community reach out to more potential users and help solve more novel real-world problems. © Owner/Author.","human-in-the-loop; human-machine interaction","Budget control; Human computer interaction; User experience; Communication gaps; Government agencies; Human computer interaction (HCI); Human machine interaction; Human-in-the-loop; Official Statistics; Real-world problem; Research communities; User interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082441071

Researchers coined it as ""democratizing AI"", where non-technical users are empowered by AutoAI technologies to create and adopt AI models. To realize such promise, AutoAI needs to translate and incorporate the real-world business logic and requirements into the automation. In this Demo, we present a first of its kinds experimental system, IBM AutoAI Playground, that enables non-technical users to define and customize their business goals (e.g., Prediction Time) as constraints.

Organisations that deploy data scientists and operational researchers (OR) must address the ethical implications of their use of data and algorithms. We review the OR and data science literature on ethics and find that this work is pitched at the level of guiding principles and frameworks and fails to provide a practical and grounded approach that can be used by practitioners as part of the analytics development process. Further, given the advent of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) an ethical dimension is likely to become an increasingly important aspect of analytics development. Drawing on the business analytics methodology (BAM) developed by Hindle and Vidgen (2018) we tackle this challenge through action research with a pseudonymous online travel company, EuroTravel. The method that emerges uses an opportunity canvas and a business ethics canvas to explore value creation and ethical aspects jointly. The business ethics canvas draws on the Markkula Center's five ethical principles (utility, rights, justice, common good, and virtue) to which explicit consideration of stakeholders is added. A contribution of the paper is to show how an ethical dimension can be embedded in the everyday exploration of analytics development opportunities, as distinct from a stand-alone ethical decision-making tool or as an overlay of a general set of guiding principles. We also propose that value and ethics should not be viewed as separate entities, rather they should be seen as inseparable and intertwined. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Business analytics; Business ethics canvas; Data science; GDPR; Markkula","Advanced Analytics; Data Science; Decision making; Business analytics; Business ethics; Development process; Ethical decision making; Ethical implications; GDPR; General data protection regulations; Markkula; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065389516

However, due to climate change, climate characteristics may shift, resulting in increased frequency/magnitude of potential failures, or exposure to new unknown risks. As vital components for the normal functioning of modern societies, the resilience of CIs under climate stressors encompasses their structural integrity, their operational elements, and their capacity to maximize business output. In this work, we propose an integrated and participatory methodological approach to enhance the resilience of interconnected CIs to urban flooding under climate change, by assessing the risk and introducing adaptation measures. The main objectives of the proposed methodology and approach are: (i) to provide scientific evidence for better understanding of how future climate regimes might affect normal operation of interconnected CI in urban areas during their lifespan; (ii) to assess the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation measures; (iii) to involve local stakeholders and operators in the co-design of the approach, as well as the assessment and the evaluation of adaptation measures; (iv) to combine computational modelling with advanced 3D visualisation techniques for effectively engaging stakeholders in decision making; (v) to include risk assessment and damage functions co-designed by end-users and local stakeholders; (vi) to integrate all of the aforementioned components in a specifically designed cloud platform as a Decision Support System for end-users, (vii) to validate the DSS by the end users and local stakeholders.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the definition of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the changes that have occurred in industry as a result. It looks at key Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and its impacts on the maritime industry. It then presents some strategies for how the maritime education sector can begin to address the paradigm shifts that will be needed to transform education so as to focus on the advantages that can be derived from the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Findings: Rapid technological advances are transforming the process of education around the world and will continue to disrupt not only the education sector but entire industries – education being only one of them. The maritime sector has some specific technologies that will drive digital transformation of business models. Maritime educational institutions around the world will need to be prepared to respond rapidly to this paradigm change and provide the skilled labour the industry will require to remain competitive. Research limitations/implications: While the technologies that are impacting the Fourth Industrial Revolution have clearly been identified, the education sector still needs practical applications and integration into curriculum and learning to truly embrace the opportunities for the development of workforce competencies in this new age. Practical implications: The maritime education sector must now start implementing strategies to expose students to new Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain and automation technology and how they are changing the future of work. A new shift in the conscious application of these game-changing technologies will be required, and examples of integration are discussed as a starting point for building a long-term plan. Social implications: The development of the human capital needed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution must begin now, and it presents challenges to those in the maritime education sector. It, therefore, requires that a digital transformation strategy is in place to deliver the specialized skills and new knowledge workers will need in the future. Originality/value: This paper discusses the disruption that the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies will bring to maritime education. One of the findings demonstrates that it clear that it is no longer competitive to ignore the disruption that is happening, and action is needed now. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital transformation; Education; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Industry 4.0; Maritime education; Seafarer",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079468097

This has motivated researchers to use deep learning-based techniques for document layout analysis. Due to recent advances in communication and in information technology, methods of data storage, extraction and processing are rapidly evolving. In an information space, there is a large volume of digital documents (DD) already available, and more DD is created continuously. The DD can be natural images, scanned documents, mails, books, archives, etc. Processing, extraction and understanding of relevant information from these DD have prime business importance. Information in DD is present in the form of tables, text, figure, images, diagram, etc. Document images (DI) are DD which are present in the form of images. It is especially office, scanned documents. Recent progress in artificial intelligence has created a growing expectation for automation of data extraction from DD. Tables are frequently present in DI. There is a desperate need to handle tabular information present in DI; otherwise, this information will remain unused and there is high possibility that it will be lost. In this work, we present weakly supervised learning-based approach to detect and recognize the location of the table. The novelty of our work is that it did not require bounding box annotations for table detection.

This technology is one of the key technologies of 5G. Aiming at the needs of network slice diversification, a network slice resource mapping method based on discrete binary particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed. This method establishes a data model for base station resources and network slice requests, defines the cost function of resource mapping, and converts the resource mapping problem into a mapping matrix optimization problem. The discrete binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimal mapping scheme at the cost of resource mapping. In order to solve the problem that the traditional discrete binary particle algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimum, a linear reduction of the inertia weight factor is adopted to balance the local and global relationships and improve the optimization accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed resource mapping method can meet the resource requirements of the network slice, while making the resource mapping cost and mapping failure rate significantly smaller than the current resource mapping strategy. © 2020 IEEE.","mapping cost; network slice; particle swarm optimization; resource mapping","Artificial intelligence; Cost functions; Failure analysis; Information systems; Information use; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Application scenario; Business requirement; Inertia weight factors; Key technologies; Linear reduction; Network functions; Resource mapping; Resource requirements; Mapping",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095585013

It is used to build artificial systems to extract valuable information from images and has a broad range of applications in various areas such as agriculture, business, and healthcare. Convolutional neural networks represent the key algorithms in computer vision, and in recent years, they have attained notable advances in many real-world problems. The accuracy of the network for a particular task profoundly relies on the hyperparameters' configuration. Obtaining the right set of hyperparameters is a time-consuming process and requires expertise. To approach this concern, we propose an automatic method for hyperparameters' optimization and structure design by implementing enhanced metaheuristic algorithms. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose enhanced versions of the tree growth and firefly algorithms that improve the original implementations. Second, we adopt the proposed enhanced algorithms for hyperparameters' optimization. First, the modified metaheuristics are evaluated on standard unconstrained benchmark functions and compared to the original algorithms. Afterward, the improved algorithms are employed for the network design. The experiments are carried out on the famous image classification benchmark dataset, the MNIST dataset, and comparative analysis with other outstanding approaches that were tested on the same problem is conducted. The experimental results show that both proposed improved methods establish higher performance than the other existing techniques in terms of classification accuracy and the use of computational resources. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolutional neural network; Enhanced metaheuristics; Firefly algorithm; Optimization; Swarm intelligence; Tree growth algorithm","Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Convolution; Heuristic algorithms; Structural optimization; Swarm intelligence; Benchmark datasets; Benchmark functions; Classification accuracy; Comparative analysis; Computational resources; Meta heuristic algorithm; Original algorithms; Real-world problem; Convolutional neural networks",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083492072

This is conducive to the digitalization of dentistry and its increasing treatment and diagnostic demands. In many areas of dentistry, such as orthodontics and maxillofacial surgery, but also periodontics or prosthetics, only a correct diagnosis ensures the correct treatment plan, which is the only way to restore the patient's health. The diagnosis and treatment plan is based on the specialist's knowledge, but is subject to a large, multi-factorial risk of error. Therefore, the introduction of multiparametric pattern recognition methods (statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)) is a great hope for both the physicians and the patients. However, the general use of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in a dental clinic is not yet realistic and requires work in many aspects - methodical, technological and business. The article presents a review of the latest attempts to apply AI, such as CDSS or genetic algorithms (GAs) in research and clinical dentistry, taking under consideration all of the main dental specialties.

In this review we reflect on what we already know about the complexity of decision-making in addition to directing particular focus on the challenges to decision-making in the high-intensity environment of the pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory. We propose that the most critical factor in outcomes for children in the catheterization lab may not be technical failures but rather human factors and the lack of preparation and robust shared decision-making process between the catheterization team. Key technical factors involved in the decision-making process include understanding the anatomy, the indications and objective to be achieved, equipment availability, procedural flow, having a back-up plan and post-procedural care plan.

It is an asset for improving the organizational performance. An organization becomes successful when it can meet the needs and demands of a consumer and to do so, organizations will have to adopt innovative HR practices. Soon, HRM will be moving away from its traditional administrative functions like recruitment, selection, appraisal to more advanced processes like Automation, Augmented Intelligence, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These processes will completely reshape and redefine the work of HRM in various organizations. At present AI is the buzz word as it is completely transforming HRM, providing millions of jobs, producing easy method of hiring, providing innovative applications and advanced solutions to various problems.

We address this question by considering three related levels of analysis: Tasks, business models, and organizations. First, we review AI's technical capabilities in relation to tasks, to identify contexts where it is likely to replace or augment humans. AI is capable of doing some, but not all, legal tasks better than lawyers and is augmented by multidisciplinary human inputs. Second, we identify new business models for creating value in legal services by applying AI. These differ from law firms' traditional legal advisory business model, because they require technological (non-human) assets and multidisciplinary human inputs. Third, we analyze the organizational structure that complements the old and new business models: The professional partnership (P2) is well-Adapted to delivering the legal advisory business model, but the centralized management, access to outside capital, and employee incentives offered by the corporate form appear better to complement the new AI-enabled business models. Some law firms are experimenting with pursuing new and old business models in parallel. However, differences in complements create conflicts when business models are combined. These conflicts are partially externalized via contracting and segregated and realigned via vertical integration. Our analysis suggests that law firm experimentation with aligning different business models to distinct organizational entities, along with ethical concerns, will affect the extent to which the legal profession will become 'hybrid professionals'. © 2020 The Author(s).

Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans. © 2020 by the authors.

Even in medicine and medical technology, companies also no longer close their minds to this development as the advantages provided by the new ideas and processes in medicine and particularly in compact disciplines, such as pediatric surgery have occasionally been recognized. Objective: This article gives a status quo analysis of artificial intelligence in international pediatric surgery with a discussion of future perspectives and suggestions from the authors’ perspective. Material and methods: Appraisal and discussion of international publications, external expert opinions and personal experiences of the authors. Results: A wide spectrum of applications using artificial intelligence in surgery is internationally available. Many of these developments can also be further adapted for use in pediatric surgery. The experience using artificial intelligence for special pediatric surgical indications is currently limited to isolated cases. Conclusion: Disciplines such as pediatric surgery cannot disregard the trend towards the application of artificial intelligence in daily practice. In addition to the establishment of current developments, the requirements of pediatric surgery should also be taken into account. These were some of the impulses that led to the founding of the working group on digitalization of the German Association for Pediatric Surgery in September 2019. © 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Digitalization; Image recognition; Machine learning; Speech recognition; Telemedicine","artificial intelligence; child; forecasting; human; Artificial Intelligence; Child; Forecasting; Humans",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074440403

More immediately, would AI accelerate our progress on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or bring us further down the path toward greater economic uncertainty, environmental collapse, and social upheaval? What are some of the implications for business leadership and the education of future business leaders? This article aims to address these questions by analyzing the impacts of AI in three case studies. It draws some preliminary inferences for management education and the business of leading corporations in the midst of rapid technological and social change. This study combines the perspectives of business strategy and public policy to analyze the impacts of AI on sustainable development with a specific focus on the advancement of the SDGs. It also draws some lessons on managerial learning and leadership development for global sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Management education; Robotics; Sustainable development; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074135528

So extra attention is needed to identify risky customer. Researchers have designed complex CRP models using artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical techniques to support the financial institutions to take correct business decisions. Though there are various statistical and AI methods available, the recent literature shows that the ensemble-based CRP model provides improved prediction results than single classifier system. The small increase in the performance of CRP model could result in a significant improvement in the profit of financial institutions and banks. This work proposes a weight-adjusted boosting ensemble method (WABEM) using rough set (RS)-based feature selection (FS) technique with the balancing and regression-based preprocessing called RS_RFS-WABEM. Regression is used to fill missing value in the records to improve the performance of CRP. Three credit datasets (Australia, German and Japanese) are chosen to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ensemble method. The trade-off between the uncertainty and imprecise probability of the proposed classifier model is evaluated using the performance measures such as accuracy and area under the curve. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble method performs better than other base and ensemble classifier methods. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Credit risk prediction (CRP); Ensemble method; Feature selection (FS); Friedman Test; Missing value; Preprocessing; Regression","Economic and social effects; Finance; Forecasting; Losses; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Rough set theory; Credit risks; Ensemble methods; Friedman test; Missing values; Preprocessing; Regression; Feature extraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069911279

Our society is experiencing an ever-growing integration of the Internet into everyday lives, and this has transformed the way we obtain and exchange information, communicate and interact with one another as well as conduct business. However, the term ‘Internet addiction’ (IA) has emerged from problematic and excessive Internet usage which leads to the development of addictive cyber-behaviours, causing health and social problems. The most commonly used intervention treatments such as motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and retreat or inpatient care mix a variety of psychotherapy theories to treat such addictive behaviour and try to address underlying psychosocial issues that are often coexistent with IA, but the efficacy of these approaches is not yet proved. The aim of this paper is to address the question of whether it is possible to cure IA with the Internet. After detailing the current state-of-the-art including various IA definitions, risk factors, assessment methods and IA treatments, we outline the main research challenges that need to be solved. Moreover, we propose an Internet-based IA Recovery Framework (IARF) which uses AI to closely observe, visualize and analyse patient’s Internet usage behaviour for possible staged intervention. The proposal to use smart Internet-based systems to control IA can be expected to be controversial. This paper is intended to stimulate further discussion and research in IA recovery through Internet-based frameworks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Internet addiction; Intervention; Recovery framework","Artificial intelligence; Computation theory; Curing; Patient rehabilitation; Recovery; Risk assessment; Computing devices; Internet addiction; Internet based system; Intervention; Research challenges; Social problems; State of the art; Technological advancement; Patient treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050677781

Especially in order to secure credit stability for companies borrowing from financial institutions, and to preemptively respond to risks, attempts to forecast the possibility of bankruptcy and adopt the forecasts into the actual business are actively conducted by major domestic banks by using online news articles and social networking site data. In this study, we suggest a specified step added to the established machine language analysis processes for opinion mining using massive amounts of text, and we provide an essential tool for it. Also, we designed an algorithm for diagnosing corporate bankruptcy, which has never been proposed in the related research area. Through deep exploratory data analysis and domain-specific data analysis, we implement a rule-based automatic tagger for labeling massive amounts of unlabeled news articles and have devised a novel prediction algorithm. As a result, we achieved 92% accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.96 with respect to performance, and a hit ratio of 50% among the 26 candidates on a list predicted by financial data analysis. Thus, we recognize that the result of our study is sufficiently complementary to financial data analysis in performance and values, but several limitations remain, such as data coverage, reliability, and incompleteness due to linguistic characteristics.

Architectural designs of such systems crave for new approaches where the data-driven decision making has to be incorporated in the solution. Methods for recommendation mechanism, prediction of operation failures, dealing with unsafe conditions etc are going to be part of the solution itself. Integrating such features to conceive an intelligent system that will directly influence the business solution is mostly appreciated. This would not have been possible without the direct interference of Artificial Intelligence which has been a standard procedure of industrial repertoire since 1980s. The direct impact of AI on social and economic life has been been felt mostly in last decade (since 2007) with the advent of smart phone, which contribute largely to big data. The era of big data has witnessed the efficacy of Machine Learning and there is a need of the hour to combine data-driven machine intelligence with human intelligence (insights and domain knowledge) to effectively make the software development (requirement, design, testing, deployment and operation management) intelligent.

In the course of PetroChina’s overseas oil and gas field production practice of more than 20 years, a series of characteristic technologies suitable for overseas oil and gas fields have been created by combining the domestic mature oil and gas field production technologies with the features of overseas oil and gas reservoirs, represented by the technology for high-speed development and stabilizing oil production and controlling water rise for overseas sandstone oilfields, high efficiency development technology for large carbonate oil and gas reservoirs and foamy oil depletion development technology in use of horizontal wells for extra-heavy oil reservoirs. Based on in-depth analysis of the challenges faced by overseas oil and gas development and technological requirements, combined with the development trends of oil and gas development technologies in China and abroad, overseas oil and gas development technologies in the future are put forward, including artificial intelligence reservoir prediction and 3D geological modeling, secondary development and enhanced oil recovery(EOR) of overseas sandstone oilfields after high speed development, water and gas injection to improve oil recovery in overseas carbonate oil and gas reservoirs, economic and effective development of overseas unconventional oil and gas reservoirs, efficient development of marine deep-water oil and gas reservoirs. The following goals are expected to be achieved: keep the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology for high water-cut sandstone oilfield at international advanced level, and make the development technology for carbonate oil and gas reservoirs reach the international advanced level, and the development technologies for unconventional and marine deep-water oil and gas reservoirs catch up the level of international leading oil companies quickly. © 2020, The Editorial Board of Petroleum Exploration and Development.

However, there is a growing misperception that congeries of data can be easily reconstructed into competitive business insights. Such notions have been encouraged by a plethora of mainstream techno-utopian forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigated such claims and related big data developments, including its “systems-first” and oligopolistic orientations. Due to the paucity of current scholarship on an admittedly pessimistic topic, the paper studied contrarian developments in the industry by relying on secondary data. The study of experts and scholars; industrial trends; and discrepancies and critical gaps in the mainstream data narrative were sourced to prognosticate the likely trajectory of many data giants. Findings: A key finding was that the big data industry faces an untenable market bubble worth trillions of dollars. This will have severe consequences for common digital access and social stability worldwide. Evidence presented also suggests that the data industrial complex may undergo a function creep by facilitating a transition from surveillance capitalism to surveillance society. Research limitations/implications: Primary data for a study of this nature may take years to materialize. This is a “first-pass” study that seeks to illuminate latent dangers facing the big data/AI sector. There is a paucity of scholarly study that even remotely touches on this topic. Therefore, supporting arguments was sourced from contemporary reports and expert study (secondary data). Practical implications: As control of data may have geostrategic implications, balkanization of the wired ecosystem may be underway with Russia and China leading the way. Future superpowers may be defined by the way they handle data. The concentration of data in fewer hands may also affect citizen innovation. Social implications: A break-down of the data industrial complex may lead to social mayhem as the monetization of presently free software, blogs and social media platforms may be unfeasible. Originality/value: This topic has hardly been explored due to the novelty of big data, its applications and the daily hype over its potentials.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors take the approach of a case study analysis. Findings: Unlike dark scenarios according to which almost half of our jobs are at risk in the wake of new emerging technologies such as AI and Blockchain (Frey and Osborne, 2013), the authors envision a world of decentralized autonomous self-owned businesses, using the example of the taxi market. The authors, first, outline their characteristics and how they work. Second, they elaborate on the socio-economic implications of markets where this novel kind of business enters. Third and most important, the authors argue that so-called robo-economic systems would be tantamount to a post-capitalistic society that is enforced by applying capitalistic principles. Research limitations/implications: The presented scenario of this paper is very futuristic and furthermore reduces a complex system quite drastically to be able to focus on the two implications of interest. Therefore, we are confronted with the necessity to take assumptions on socio-technical feasibilities and individual preferences. Most of these assumptions can be challenged (see Section 6.3). Social implications: The scenario presented by the authors stands in contrast to the fear that increased automation inherently leads to increased inequality. There is a general debate going on whether automation and digitalization will lead to a massive loss of employment, because machines will replace humans in many fields of work. Frey and Osborne (2013) estimate that nearly every second job is at risk to disappear in the coming decades because of computerization. Hence, many people fear to be left behind because of this development and inequality will increase tremendously as only those who own the machines will benefit directly from the profit share. In the scenario, however, the profits are mostly distributed among the consumers via reduced prices. Originality/value: The proposed scenario seems to reconcile socialism (less private property) with liberalism (a radicalization of markets) and shows an effective way to tackle market power, the problem that certain persons and firms would benefit almost exclusively from the increased profit margins promised by automation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain; Future markets; Robo-economic systems; Scenario thinking; Self-owned businesses",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074888535

Determining the best sustainable project based on various sustainability attributes is a very complicated decision. Accordingly, developing a suitable decision support framework can be very helpful for decision makers to attain planned business goals and complete projects at the right time with good quality. This research develops a decision support model which helps managers to understand the concept of sustainability in construction project selection and choose the best project using a new integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach under uncertainty by integrating Fuzzy Preference Programming (FPP) as a modification of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), with Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) as a fuzzy rule-based expert system. In the first phase of the research, fifteen sustainability attributes were selected. In the second phase, the final weight of each attribute was computed by using FPP. In the last phase, the most appropriate project was selected by running the weighted FIS. The results showed that Project 3 (P3) is the best project. Finally, two different evaluative tests were also applied to verify the validity and robustness of the developed model. © 2020 The Author(s).

The mining of high-utility association rules (HARs) from high-utility itemsets enables users to select their own weights for rules, based either on the utility or confidence values. This approach also provides more information, which can help managers to make better decisions. Some efficient methods for mining HARs have been developed in recent years. However, in some decision-support systems, users only need to mine a smallest set of HARs for efficient use. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for the efficient mining of non-redundant high-utility association rules (NR-HARs). We first build a semi-lattice of mined high-utility itemsets, and then identify closed and generator itemsets within this. Following this, an efficient algorithm is developed for generating rules from the built lattice. This new approach was verified on different types of datasets to demonstrate that it has a faster runtime and does not require more memory than existing methods. The proposed algorithm can be integrated with a variety of applications and would combine well with external systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed computer systems. Many companies have been applying IoT and such computing systems into their business activities, monitoring data or decision-making. The data can be sent into the system continuously through the IoT or any other information system. Selecting an appropriate and fast approach helps management to visualize customer needs as well as make more timely decisions on business strategy. © 2020 by the authors.

This industry can greatly benefit from new sensing technologies and advances in artificial intelligence that have been achieved over the last few years. However, in most situations waste management systems are based on obsolete technologies, with a low level of interoperability and thus offering static processes. The most advanced solutions are generally limited to statistical, non-predictive approaches and have a limited view of reality, making them weakly effective in dealing with day-to-day business issues (overflowing containers, poor quality of service, etc.). This paper presents a case study currently being developed in Luxembourg with a company offering a business waste collection service, which has a significant amount of constraints to consider. Our main objective is to investigate the use of multiple waste data sources to derive useful indicators for improving collection processes. We start with company-owned historical data and then investigate GPS information from tracking devices positioned on collection trucks. Furthermore, we analyze data collected from ultrasonic sensors deployed on almost 50 different containers to measure fill levels. We describe the deployment steps and show that this approach, combined with anomaly detection and prediction techniques, has the potential to change the way this business operates. We also discuss the interest of the different datasets presented and multi-objective optimization issues. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first major work dedicated to the world of professional waste collection. © 2019 by the authors.

Transforming the operation of businesses has been possible because of the astonishing speed at which technology has witnessed the change. The automotive industry is on the edge of a revolution. The increased customer expectations, changing ownership, self-driving vehicles and much more have led to the transformation of automobiles, applications, and services from artificial intelligence, sensors, RFID to big data analysis. Large automobiles industries have been emphasizing the collection of data to gain insight into customer's expectations, preferences, and budgets alongside competitor's policies. Statistical methods can be applied to historical data, which has been gathered from various authentic sources and can be used to identify the impact of fixed and variable marketing investments and support automakers to come up with a more effective, precise, and efficient approach to target customers. Proper analysis of supply chain data can disclose the weak links in the chain enabling to adopt timely countermeasures to minimize the adverse effects. In order to fully gain benefit from analytics, the collaboration of a detailed set of capabilities responsible for intersecting and integrating with multiple functions and teams across the business is required.

These teams are distributed in nature and work on same set of goals and objectives. They are undertaking their assignments to get multiple advantages like global exposure, new software world to explore, learning environment, etc. This change is having a significant effect on marketing and distribution as well as on the way software products are perceived, designed, developed, tested, and delivered to customers. Software experts in Global Software Development environment are also facing many challenges like as well. Moreover, risk is a big challenge out of other challenges but not many researchers addressed risk related to Time, Budget and Resources. Developing software projects to address business needs and requirements is so exceedingly complex and troublesome that it is common for software projects to overrun budgets and exceed scheduled completion dates. Business managers need the whole development process streamlined and more manageable, with projected cost and timings and for better decision making. The utilization of artificial intelligence techniques to manage risk is helpful when taking care of and assessing unstructured information because of the self-learning and self-healing nature of artificial intelligence-based algorithms. In this paper an Artificial Intelligence based architecture has been proposed that reduces risk by using Time, Budget and Resource constraints that will help decision maker to take decisions and get optimal solutions.

Will the future data world be dominated by those using our data to control and manipulate us and enrich themselves, or will it be filled with organizations and individuals, which we call “data coaches”, using the knowledge and data the world generates to improve ourselves. We posit that the world’s future would be much brighter if it included more data coaches. Unfortunately, the dominant business models of today tend to favor the more self serving analytics and data practices. To help balance this inequity, we propose a conceptual model of a “Data Driven Life Coach” that would build a more enriching and fulfilling future for citizens of a future world filled with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms built using the data gathered on an individual. © 2020, © Copyright 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,"analytical method; conceptual framework; future prospect; knowledge; machine learning; management practice; profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086265943

The success or failure of industry leaders interested in the continuous improvement of lean management systems in this context is determined by their ability to recognize behavioral patterns in these big data structured within non-Euclidean domains, such as these dynamic sociotechnical complex networks. We assume that artificial intelligence in general and deep learning in particular may be able to help find useful patterns of behavior in 4.0 industrial environments in the lean management of cyber–physical systems. However, although these technologies have meant a paradigm shift in the resolution of complex problems in the past, the traditional methods of deep learning, focused on image or video analysis, both with regular structures, are not able to help in this specific field. This is why this work focuses on proposing geometric deep lean learning, a mathematical methodology that describes deep-lean-learning operations such as convolution and pooling on cyber–physical Industry 4.0 graphs.

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow. The research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error.

Of these, artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular machine learning (ML) are globally disruptive, rapidly growing sectors of technology whose impact on the long-established field of histopathology is quickly being realized. The development of increasing numbers of algorithms, peering ever deeper into the histopathological space, has demonstrated to the scientific community that AI pathology platforms are now poised to truly impact the future of precision and personalized medicine. However, as with all great technological advances, there are implementation and adoption challenges. This review aims to define common and relevant AI and ML terminology, describe data generation and interpretation, outline current and potential future business cases, discuss validation and regulatory hurdles, and most importantly, propose how overcoming the challenges of this burgeoning technology may shape toxicologic pathology for years to come, enabling pathologists to contribute even more effectively to answering scientific questions and solving global health issues.*This article is a product of a Special Interest Group of the Society of Toxicologic Pathology (STP).

From the booming economy of information processing to the increasing need of quality of service (QoS) in the business of networking, the dynamic task-scheduling problem has attracted worldwide attention. Due to its complexity, task scheduling has been defined and classified as an NP-hard problem. Additionally, most dynamic online task scheduling often manages tasks in a complex environment, which makes it even more challenging to balance and satisfy the benefits of each aspect of cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence algorithm, called deep Q-learning task scheduling (DQTS), that combines the advantages of the Q-learning algorithm and a deep neural network. This new approach is aimed at solving the problem of handling directed acyclic graph (DAG) tasks in a cloud computing environment. The essential idea of our approach uses the popular deep Q-learning (DQL) method in task scheduling, where fundamental model learning is primarily inspired by DQL. Based on developments in WorkflowSim, experiments are conducted that comparatively consider the variance of makespan and load balance in task scheduling. Both simulation and real-life experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of optimization and learning abilities in DQTS. The result shows that when compared with several standard algorithms precoded in WorkflowSim, DQTS has advantages regarding learning ability, containment, and scalability. In this paper, we have successfully developed a new method for task scheduling in cloud computing. © 2019","Cloud computing; Deep Q-learning algorithm; Directed acyclic graph; Task scheduling; WorkflowSim","Cloud computing; Complex networks; Computational complexity; Deep neural networks; Directed graphs; Multitasking; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling algorithms; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Cloud computing environments; Complex environments; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Dynamic task scheduling; Q-learning algorithms; Task-scheduling; WorkflowSim; Learning algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074515060

A focus on the payment range for protective services for shallow landslide is described. The maximum willingness to pay by real estate owners and the minimum willingness to accept by forest owners are computed. The model quantifies the economic risk of real estate depending on the loss probability due to landslide and the presence and protection efficiency of forest. The potential compensation to forest managers considers the difference of the forest expected value from current practices (business as usual – BAU – scenario) to the intervention optimized for PES. A geostatistical approach is applied to quantify the uncertainty of the output. The results indicate relevant differences from BAU to PES in term of an increased protection efficiency and reduced uncertainty. The suitability of protective forest for PES activation is approximately 46 % of the total surface in the study area (Municipality Union of Sieve and Arno Valleys, Tuscany – central Italy). The output also highlights the strong influence of the tree species composition on the value of the PES scenario and indicates that Turkey oak and mixed broadleaved forests are more likely to fall under a PES scheme.

To capture the collective dynamics of posting reviews, we used real-world big data collected over 153 months to drive an agent-based model for replicating the operation process of online review systems. The model explains the effects of clicking position (e.g., on a review webpage's serial list) and the number of items per webpage on posting contributions. Reading reviews from the last webpage only, or from the first webpage and last webpage simultaneously, can promote a greater review volume than reading reviews in other positions. This illustrates that representing primacy (first items) and recency (recent items) within one page simultaneously, or displaying recent items in reverse chronological order, are relatively better strategies for the webpage display of online reviews. The number of items plays a nonlinear moderating role in bridging the clicking position and posting behavior, and we determine the optimal number of items. To effectively establish strategies for webpage design in online review systems, business managers must switch from reliance on experience to reliance on an agent-based model as a decision support system for the formalized webpage design of online review systems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Agent-based modeling; Big data; Clicking position; Online review systems; Posting behavior","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Big data; Computational methods; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Simulation platform; Websites; Agent-based model; Business managers; Chronological order; Clicking position; Collective dynamics; Online reviews; Operation process; Posting behavior; Online systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072852391

When arriving at a purchasing decision, a majority of online consumers rely on reviews since they offer credible means of mining opinions of other consumers regarding a particular product.The trustworthiness of online reviews directly affects a company’s reputation and profitability, which is why certain business owners pay fraudsters to generate deceptive reviews. Such generation of deceptive reviews which manipulate the purchasing decision of consumers is a persistent and harmful issue. Hence, developing methods to assist businesses and consumers by distinguishing between credible reviews and deceptive reviews remains to be a crucial, yet challenging task. In view of that, this paper unravels prominent techniques that have been proposed to solve the issue of deceptive review detection.

Hence, industry is engaged in an accelerated automation race where industrial automation converts value chains into intelligent, data-driven systems. This generates new business models and spurs firm competitiveness in general. Companies thus pay attention to the development, acquisition, and incorporation of related technologies to profit from these developments in specific. For this, they must incorporate external flows of knowledge to succeed in innovation. Yet, there is a dearth of research that links open innovation to the incorporation of industrial automation, and to firm performance. Hence, this paper takes a knowledge-based view of the firm and sheds light on the moderating role of the processes of open innovation on the economic results of firms’ subject to automation. In order to do so, we estimate the impact of the interaction of open innovation and automation on firm turnover using panel data for 5287 Spanish firms from a variety of manufacture and service industries. We separate the effects for different open-innovation partners and find that turnover is increased for those automating firms that engage in open innovation with suppliers. These results indicate that suppliers possess the knowledge required for successful automation, and firms that innovate together with suppliers fare better at leveraging investments in automation. In addition, automating firms should exercise caution when choosing collaboration partners from the same country. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automation; Community innovation survey; Knowledge; Open innovation; Process innovation; Supplier innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049775026

However, due to the sheer amount of model parameters, the inference speed of these models is very slow. How to apply these complex models to real business scenarios becomes a challenging but practical problem. Previous model compression methods usually suffer from information loss during the model compression procedure, leading to inferior models compared with the original one. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Two-stage Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (TMKD for short) method for web Question Answering system. We first develop a general Q&A distillation task for student model pre-training, and further fine-tune this pre-trained student model with multi-teacher knowledge distillation on downstream tasks (like Web Q&A task, MNLI, SNLI, RTE tasks from GLUE), which effectively reduces the overfitting bias in individual teacher models, and transfers more general knowledge to the student model. The experiment results show that our method can significantly outperform the baseline methods and even achieve comparable results with the original teacher models, along with substantial speedup of model inference. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Distillation pre-training; Knowledge distillation; Model compression; Multi-teacher; Two-stage","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Distillation; E-learning; Information retrieval; Students; Websites; Business scenario; General knowledge; Model compression; Multi-teacher; Practical problems; Pre-training; Question Answering; Web question answering systems; Personnel training",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079536665

This has led to several thousands of processes involved. Manual inspection of processes became very tedious and impractical exercise. Process mining came into existence to deal with extraction or discovery of business processes, finding outliers and anomalies besides process enhancement. Out of these aspects, anomaly detection and process enhancement are given high importance. The existing methods in this area have limitations in terms of accurately identifying anomalies and enhancing the processes. To overcome this problem, a comprehensive framework is proposed for detecting anomalies from business process event logs and rectify anomalies for process enhancement. The Simple Auto Encoder based Anomaly Detection (SAE-AD) algorithm is proposed to achieve this. However, it is deterministic in nature while making prediction decisions. A probabilistic algorithm called Probabilistic Auto Encoder based Anomaly Detection (PAE-AD) is proposed to detect anomalies and enhance processes involved. Both algorithms are based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with unsupervised learning. Empirical study is made with Business Process Intelligence (BPI) challenge datasets especially targeted for process mining research.

In this paper, a novel approach is described how discrete-event simulations shall be enhanced by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize manufacturing schedules for complex job shop manufacturing networks in the high-Tech energy industry. This work attempts to close the gap between the growing expectations on AI-based discrete-event simulations for manufacturing schedule optimization on the one hand and the current limitations of data quality and Information Technology (IT) capabilities in existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems on the other hand. In order to deliver the expected benefits, business targets of schedule optimization need to be understood, the solution approach has to be defined and verified in a complex manufacturing environment. Performance and reliability of the implemented solution are validated with two real data sets derived from ongoing business planning activities. An actor-critic architecture is proposed which uses a multi-stage schedule compression algorithm for modifying the start dates of production orders according to defined business targets and a genetic algorithm which selects production orders for automated make or buy decisions. The first research result is the provision of a manufacturing schedule for 375 product types, more than 180 manufacturing resources, 367 process variants (routings), and a total of 1.293 production orders at about 80% average capacity utilization of bottleneck machinery in a 12 months planning horizon, which is optimized according to lead times of customer products.

This book examines four areas where risks are present: artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), government and malware. The authors channel their experience and research into an accessible body of knowledge for consideration by professionals. AI is introduced as a tool for healthcare, security and innovation. The advantages of using AI in new industries are highlighted in the context of recent developments in mechanical engineering, and a survey of AI software risks is presented focusing on well-publicized failures and US FDA regulatory guidelines. The risks associated with the billions of devices that form the IoT grow with the availability of such devices in consumer products, healthcare, energy infrastructure and transportation. The risks, software engineering risk mitigation methods and standards promoting a level of care for the manufacture of IoT devices are examined because of their importance for software developers. Strategic insights for software developers looking to do business with the US federal government are presented, considering threats to both public and private sectors as well as governmental priorities from recent executive and legislative branch actions. Finally, an analysis of malicious software that infects numerous computer systems each day and causes millions of dollars in damages every year is presented. Malicious software, or ""malware,"" is software designed with hostile intent, but the damage may be mitigated with static and dynamic analyses, which are processes for studying how malware operates and analyzing potential impacts. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To meet the objective, hierarchical model is developed including criteria, sub-criteria, alternatives. Proposed decision support system (DSS) is developed with objective as textile supply chain performance measurement with 4 stakeholder value creation perspectives (Financial, Customer, Internal business processes, Innovation and learning) suggested by balanced scorecard (BSC) as criteria, having 23 sub-criteria (key performance indicators) and 3 supply chain operations (Procurement-Production-Distribution) as alternatives. Structured Delphi method and Minitab 17.0 software for statistical analysis are used for the development of decision support framework. Whereas, for establishing pair wise comparison and analyzing the relative importance of these criteria, sub-criteria and alternative, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used. The paper demonstrates the application of decision support system in identifying key performance indicators and analyzing the importance of KPIs towards overall performance of supply chain in textile. The proposed system is put to test at four textile case industries. Case company wise implication as well general implications on textile supply chain performance is presented. Also, managerial implication and limitations are presented. Proposed study presented novel approach in developing DSS for textile supply chain performance measurement, which is very rare one. This DSS will be used for identifying key performance metrics/indicators and also analyzing their importance towards supply chain performance. Use of BSC perspective has given framework wholesome coverage of all stakeholders’ consideration. Also, involvement of supply chain cyclic operation added consideration of supply chain partners. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Decision support system (DSS); Delphi method; Key performance indicators (KPIs); Performance measurement; Supply chain management (SCM); Supply chain performance measurement (SCPM)","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Supply chain management; Textile industry; Textiles; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Decision support system; Delphi method; Key performance indicator; Key performance indicators; Performance measurements; Supply chain management; Supply chain performance measurement; Supply chain performance measurements; Decision support systems",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132865144

Some have highlighted the company’s original intentions in creating the code of conduct, while others have used the motto as a basis for critiquing the company—such as for its advertising practices, failure to pay corporate tax or the manipulation of Google-owned content. The imperative’s removal occurred at a time when thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery, which could in turn be used to improve the targeting capability of drone strikes. Employees asserted their refusal to be involved in the business of war and expressed their wariness of the United States government’s use of technology.

Technological development enhances labour productivity and creates new jobs in some industries requiring to be different skills while it destroys jobs in ones requiring to be low-skilled. Today, it is experiencing a deep digital transformation. It may be evaluated for Industry 4.0 to cause technological unemployment due to changes in the structure of employment and to bring about new structural problems in labour market. In addition, it is expected for technological progress such as automation and robotic in the production process to negatively influence employment of low-skilled workers. Industry 4.0 has generated a new production model, in which robotic technologies are effectively used in the production process. So-called new technology-based production process has started to change production, working relationship and daily life. Discussions about the effects of the developments in technology on the labour market and unemployment are separated two groups. While there exist optimist views indicating that such development in technology will result in more productivity, pessimists believe that the use of robots, artificial intelligence, smart systems and algorithms in business life will eventually bring problems such as mass unemployment, mass poverty and social disruption.

Within the fourth industrial revolution, pursuing digitalization and on the verge of a leap to Industry 5.0 companies and systems all over the world generate a mass of data. These data have to be collected, analyzed, interpreted, and information derived to take the best business decisions to gain the optimized strategy direction. Due to the large amount of data, analysis for business analysts today is only possible to a limited extent. Therefore, companies need support by Cyber-Physical Systems to group the data, enrich the information, and automate decision-making. In the following paper, the data foundation as an important prerequisite for business decision taking and Artificial Intelligence execution will be researched. Therefore, the required terms are defined and described in theory. Afterward, the data foundation for companies are analyzed by interviews with experts and business representatives as well as field studies. The first finding is that many companies analyze only a small portion of the available data, whereby important insights get lost.

It investigates the interactions from both the firm/organization strategy perspective, including cross-functional actors/stakeholders who are operating within the organization and the various characteristics of operating in a cyber-secure ecosystem. As consumption and reliance by business on the use of vast amounts of data in operations increase, demand for more data governance to minimize the issues of bias, trust, privacy and security may be necessary. The role of management is changing dramatically, with the challenges of Industry 4.0 and the digital revolution. With this intelligence explosion, the influence of artificial intelligence technology and the key themes of machine learning, big data, and digital twin are evolving and creating the need for cyber-physical management professionals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques can aid the creation and design of new products and services by producing highly sensitive analytics. These analytics can increase the speed of idea generation or “creative intensity” (Erevelles et al. 2016) by providing real-time assessments of multiple offering variations and predictions of their potential market success (Lehrer et al. 2018). Furthermore, these analytics can be a source of competitive advantage in highly competitive markets that require a continuous degree of product newness. Although several studies show that various organizational processes can be optimized and automated to some degree (Bradlow et al. 2017), relatively little is understood about the value that advanced data manipulation systems bring to the decision-making process at individual, cognitive, level, in particular when choices and judgments of product creativity or innovativeness are involved. Understanding how to capitalize on augmented and data-driven decision-making processes in relation to different creative alternatives becomes essential to generate competitive advantage in this area. Individual decision makers, with their limited mental capacities, are still required to frame problems, select which data to collect, assess the robustness of the data and their sources, and decide on analytical frameworks. Most importantly, decision makers must interpret the findings within the business context in which they operate and use insights to support strategic, tactical, and operational decisions leading to the development of new market offerings. Within this context, this study seeks to understand how managers use analytics to stimulate new product and service innovations and aid creativity decisions. In particular, the study seeks to contribute to the field of marketing decision-making by providing an assessment of how machine learning and artificial intelligence affects the generation and selection of new product ideas. It also contributes to the growing multidisciplinary literature on data analytics by assessing its value from a decision-making perspective. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Creative intensity; Creativity; Decision Making; Machine learning; New product development",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125248193

The proposed research presentations will address a wide range of cutting-edge topics—digital unengagement, access economy, smart interactive services, social media spokesperson character, influencer, and compulsive media use. These topics are timely, novel, and important and thus are expected to stimulate active discussions at the AMS conference. This special session attends to consumer well-being in digital environment in two ways: physical well-being and psychological well-being. As for the former, we attempt to explore the impact of interactive health applications and smart services. As for the latter, we focus on a social media environment and access economy, where issues related to world-of-mouth from and proper product/service representation are increasingly important. We strongly believe that this special session will effectively deliver one of the key AMS missions—“promoting high standards and excellence in the creation and dissemination of marketing knowledge and the furtherance of marketing practice through a role of leadership within the discipline of marketing around the world.” This session unites scholars from the United Kingdom and Japan, two of the G20 members that represent an important portion of world digital economy. The United Kingdom along with Germany account for 25% of the top 100 digital multinational enterprises, including Internet platforms, e-commerce, and digital content firms (UNCTAD 2017). Likewise, Japan is considered as the innovation hubs of automation, sensory technologies, and artificial intelligence (LSE Consulting 2018).

AI is a branch of computer science that combines machine learning, logic and natural language processing to emulate human intelligence. By processing vast amounts of data and recognising patterns in the data, AI produces insights and analytics at or above human capability (IEEE 2017). It has been applied to fashion in trend forecasting, personalisation, customer interaction and the use of CGI models. For example, Amazon developed “Echo Look” which combines computer vision with predictive AI and human analysis to assess a consumer’s current wardrobe choices and provide recommendations of what to wear. Users can ask the machine to rate two different possible outfits in terms of current trends and actual appearance (Gibbs 2017). Online styling subscription Stitch Fix uses machine learning algorithms to determine its customers’ preferred styles and offer personalised recommendations. AI has also been developed to mimic the role of social media influencers and models. CGI character “Miquela” has 1.6 million Instagram followers, collaborates with luxury brands and launched her own clothing brand, but is not a real person. There is a dedicated digital modelling agency (Davis 2018). Such innovations are likely to further inflame the ongoing ethical debate about using digital technologies and virtual reality at the risk of opportunities for real people, for example diminishing already scarce opportunities for black models (Graham 2018), or introducing norms of artificial appearance and personal aesthetics impossible for ‘real’ people to achieve. AI has the potential to revolutionise fashion through greater precision, accuracy and effectiveness in decision-making, but at what cost? To what extent can and should AI replicate and replace human creativity and presence in an industry sector founded on human input in creating new trends? Yet, AI that predicts garment suitability and offers greater customisation for consumers may reduce waste and over-consumption (Snow 2017). Producing items which have greater relevance could reduce returns, markdowns and warehouse space, plus increase customer satisfaction and experience. Automating repetitive tasks could save money and time for greater value-added activities, for example through the use of chatbots for online customer service. This paper applies the lens of CSR to inform the debate on whether core fashion retailing functions can and should be replaced by AI. A CSR approach argues for businesses assuming social responsibilities beyond any economic, technical and legal obligations which constitute its existence, with the objective of reconciling economic, social and environmental objectives (Davis 1973). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","AI; CSR; Ethics; Fashion",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125202663

Service robots, operate in service environments across the globe, interacting with consumer and service entities alike (Li 2015), signalling the era of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) (Mende 2017). Barnett et al. (2014, p. 1134) define interactive service robots as “social robots capable of working within service environments and interacting with consumers through various service encounters”. Service researchers have acknowledged that the field of service research is behind in studying the impact of robots on various aspects of service (Mende 2017; van Doorn et al. 2017), which constitutes the focus and contribution of this research. In this paper, we conduct a Systematic Scoping Review of interdisciplinary journal articles and conference proceedings, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al. 2015) and the methodology outlined by Peters et al. (2015). The first stage of the search process resulted in 1477 articles published in a wide variety of journals ranging from marketing and business journals (i.e. Journal of Service Research and Journal of Business Research) to articles published in journals from other disciplines (i.e. International Journal of Social Robotics, Technology Innovation Management Review and Frontiers in Psychology). Following the PRISMA guidelines our final sample consists of 95 publications. Our results indicate a great disparity in the conceptualisation and definitions of service robots and HRI in service (e.g. terms used to refer to service robots range from ‘anthropomorphised robots’ to ‘socially assistive robots’). Interestingly we found that many papers simply ‘operationalised’ service robots, offering no conceptualisation, definition or explanation. Our analysis of the various conceptualisations and operationalisations leads us to propose a comprehensive definition of service robots in service which may be used to guide future service research and clarify the boundaries of what a service robot is and is not, particularly in comparison to other similar and related technologies such as artificial intelligence. This study found that service robots as a research field is disparate, and disjointed with a weak theoretical foundation where the majority of studies are empirical in nature. This research proposes multiple research avenues and acts as a guide for future research, allowing service researchers to delve further into this phenomenon. By exploring and understanding service robots and human-robot interaction in service researchers and practitioners will be able to better integrate robots into service. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Human-robot interaction; Relationships; Service encounter; Service robot; Social robot",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125202566

CRM practitioners face challenges such as efficient management of enormous amount of data generated by customer interactions plus extracting, analyzing and interpreting this data to give true value to the information received (Bradlow et al. 2017). A further challenge is the centralization of data from interactions on digital interfaces, social networks and Internet of Things (Culotta et al. 2015), in CRM to provide value for the business objectives. Whilst the application of artificial intelligence (AI) may seem like a radical innovation, most eminent predictive techniques- Neural networks (NN) and Classification and Regression trees (CART) have their roots in AI. Indeed, automated notifications and auto-responders are early examples of automation in customer relationship management. Of late, these automated forms of interactivity are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the rapid advancement in the AI technologies. Interestingly authors Kumar et al. (2016) point to an considerable increase of customer relationships and interactions with the businesses through automated means in near future, particularly as the main objective of AI as a science is to create intelligent machines to do things that otherwise would require intelligence if done by humans (Boden 1977). The quantity of academic works examining the impact of AI on CRM remains limited reflecting the nascence of the topic. However there remains a gap for work that examines the perceptions, understanding and attitudes of the business professionals who will be adopting and implementing AI in their business practices. In this paper we use Affordance Theory as a lens with which to identify the affordances and constraints that AI offers business practitioners. Drawing on the work of Nagy and Neff (2015) we utilize the concept of the “imagined affordance” to test a model of AI acceptance that draws user perception, attitudes and expectation. Our work develops the role of imagination and vision in technology acceptance research and provides an alternative approach to the dominant by rational, conscious and process-orientated perspectives (Nagy and Neff 2015). © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Affordance theory; AI; Artificial intelligence; CRM",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125181362

Healthcare costs are also becoming increasingly expensive and with increased demands and the technological developments, major changes in the healthcare value chain and business models are on their way to disrupt the healthcare system as we know it. It is time to change the way we see health and disease in a static sense and instead view life as a dynamic process where the maintenance of health is followed from far before symptoms of any sort start to appear. Technological developments within data science have begun having an impact on the healthcare ecosystem but are yet to show their full potential. The digitization of the healthcare system in the last decade has led to an ever-increasing source for data production. The amount of data generated is increasing exponentially and collection of healthcare data from various sources is rapidly on the rise. Collection, management, and storage of all this data is very costly and may not be of value unless converted into insights that can be used by the healthcare ecosystem. For maximum optimization and usefulness, the data needs to be analyzed, interpreted, and acted upon. ML and DL allow for the generation of new knowledge from all the collected data and can help reduce the cost/time-based burden on all healthcare systems via learning, better prediction, and diagnosis.

This chapter discusses how most of these issues can be addressed through intelligent use of real-time operating data continuously collected from their production facilities. It advocates the use of a data-driven strategy to optimize operational efficiency and maintenance and enable business personnel to quickly and easily take corrective action when abnormal conditions occur. By taking corrective actions in real time, unnecessary costs can be avoided, bottom line profitability is increased, employee safety is maintained, and responsible environmental stewardship is achieved.

These attacks are relatively simple to conduct, even by an unskilled attacker and cause significant loss. For this reason, it is particularly important that these attacks are detected, recognized and blocked in time. Most of the advanced methods and tools to protect against such attacks are based on monitoring and constant tracking in order to detect suspicious IP traffic. The application of these methods is associated with additional computational resources and expertise, which leads to subjectivity in the threat assessment. Therefore, it is necessary to propose methods for automated adaptive detection and recognition of Distributed Denial of Service attacks. This study presents a method for automated detection and recognition of some of the Distributed Denial of Service attacks, by means of an automated adaptive system, based on a multilayer neural network. It is trained both normal and with signals reflecting different traffic conditions when Distributed Denial of Service attacks occur. The neural network is tested to recognize “baseline signals”, representing different normal traffic conditions and to detect the abnormal traffic situations. The research is conducted for different kinds of internal Distributed Denial of Service attacks on a real Local Area Network. The obtained recognition accuracy results are represented and the achieved benefits are discussed. © 2020 School of Science, IHU.

Cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology which replaces the traditional cryptographic methods. Although there is still a lot of research going on to find its applicability in various other domains, in this chapter we will discuss the workings of cryptocurrency with its key applications in big data and its impact on it. The world is heading towards the information age where “data is the new gold” and with this rapid production of diverse data, its processing and management becomes chaotic. Thus, big data technology comes in handy that is effective enough to deal with such humongous data (from its processing till its storage), after which there is a dire need for security which can be easily handled by blockchain. Blockchain, whose architecture was designed to address some of the primary concerns like decentralization, privacy, identity, trust and ownership of data and its unique architecture provides some superior features that can effectively manage those concerns. This chapter provides an outlook on big data and blockchain individually from viewpoints of various situations in which both big data and blockchain coexist to ensure data quality in various sectors, including web, health, education and government, by means of diagrams, workings and inner implementations. We will also discuss the importance of Blockchain and Big Data in national development with its various aspects in Industry 4.0 and some other future aspects that need to be addressed. This chapter is designed to give insights into various facets of cryptocurrency, blockchain and big data and how they are combined to perform certain operations pertaining to the tasks of any organization or institution that may be private or public. Also, the various advantages of using this combination for the overall development of any business or nation’s economy are discussed. © 2020 Scrivener Publishing LLC.","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Smart and sustainable",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113752588

These methods are implemented on an experimental dataset obtained during a workshop participated by disaster management experts from several Canadian electricity utilities. Results show that all of the employed machine learning methods have very high and almost similar accuracy in predicting DMA decisions.

In this context the article first considers the workings of the rules denying input credits to makers of financial supplies, where it is noted that the legislative provisions have been interpreted expansively so as to determine creditability based on direct or indirect attribution to taxable or input taxed supplies. The article then considers the rules for apportioning inputs between creditable and non-creditable purposes and notes a debate as to the extent to which particular expenses need to be directly related to taxable or input taxed activities in order to be included in a general apportionment formula. The article also considers the proper approach to how supplies should be characterised for GST purposes and the extent to which this relies on a view that the GST is ‘a practical business tax'.

With a network of 1.4 million km, it spends several hundred million Euros every year to maintain the existing network. Enedis is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to choose which parts of the network have to be renewed. The general approach of the targeting method presented in this paper was initially developed for underground Low Voltage (LV) networks and has been successfully used for three years. However, it could not be directly applied to the Medium Voltage (MV) network due to its different structure, with fewer but much longer feeders. MV network reliability is even more critical since faults on this network usually have a bigger impact on power supply. In order to fit some machine learning models on a portion of the network which has a size relevant for renewal investment, it has been necessary to develop complex data analytics, such as graph calculation, to get the useful features to train the models. The technologies used for data preparation allows the solution to be scaled up after successful tests on smaller dataset. We estimate that this new method applied over a three years period increases the number of faulty cables identified by 60%, compared to the current business as usual targeting method.

It is a multibillion-dollar transnational criminal business that affects us all through trade and consumer choices. In 2016, an estimated 25 million people were forced to work through threats, violence, coercion, deception, or debt bondage. Of these, 16 million were forced to work in the private sector. Given the widespread nature of the problem, governments, corporations, and the general public are increasingly expecting companies to accurately disclose the actions they are taking to tackle modern slavery. Yet, five years on, there are challenges with understanding companies’ compliance under the 2015 UK Modern Slavery Act. It is unclear which companies are failing to report under the MSA, while the quality of these statements often remains poor. Project AIMS (Artificial Intelligence against Modern Slavery) harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) for tackling modern slavery by analyzing modern slavery statements to assess compliance with the UK and Australian Modern Slavery Acts, in order to prompt business action and policy responses. This paper examines the challenges and opportunities for better machine readability of modern slavery statements identified in the initial stages of this project. Machine readability is important to extract data from modern slavery statements to enable analysis using AI techniques. Although extensive technological solutions can be used to extract data from PDFs and HTMLs, establishing transparency and accessibility requirements would reduce the resources required to assess modern slavery reporting and ultimately understand what companies are doing to address modern slavery in their direct operations and supply chains - unlocking this critical ‘AI for Social Good’ use case.

Modern asset management draws on a wide-range of fields beyond financial theory: economics, financial accounting, econometrics/statistics, management science, operations research (optimization and Monte Carlo simulation), and more recently, data science (Big Data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence). The challenge in writing an institutional asset management book is that when tools from these different fields are applied in an investment strategy or an analytical framework for valuing securities, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the fundamentals of these fields. Attempting to explain strategies and analytical concepts while also providing a primer on the tools from other fields is not the most effective way of describing the asset management process. Moreover, while an increasing number of investment models have been proposed in the asset management literature, there are challenges and issues in implementing these models. This book provides a description of the tools used in asset management as well as a more in-depth explanation of specialized topics and issues covered in the companion book, Fundamentals of Institutional Asset Management. The topics covered include the asset management business and its challenges, the basics of financial accounting, securitization technology, analytical tools (financial econometrics, Monte Carlo simulation, optimization models, and machine learning), alternative risk measures for asset allocation, securities finance, implementing quantitative research, quantitative equity strategies, transaction costs, multifactor models applied to equity and bond portfolio management, and backtesting methodologies. This pedagogic approach exposes the reader to the set of interdisciplinary tools that modern asset managers require in order to extract profits from data and processes. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, environmental agencies have started using AI in the fight against environmental crime, thus enhancing regulatory effectiveness. For businesses, this implies being subjected to a greater scrutiny by the authorities. Hence, the adoption of AI tools could help address the corporate need for developing compliance strategies to cope with environmental regulations and to avoid the imposition of punitive sanctions. This article discusses the good and the bad of using AI to improve corporate criminal compliance in the environmental area. Starting from the consideration that, also in this field, the automation makes it more difficult to allocate corporate criminal liability, the contribution highlights how other legal concerns, such as those related to privacy and corporate surveillance on employees, appear less relevant, suggesting that this could be a significant area for further research. © 2020 Editions Eres.

Before embarking on formulating and developing these approaches and tools, senior managers' informational roles and information behavior should be understood. This paper explores factors influencing and shaping existing senior managers' information behavior in order to shed light on value-added approaches or technological solutions for supporting and improving informational roles of senior managers.

In this work, we propose a novel information-theoretic decomposition of the total discrimination (in a counterfactual sense) into a non-exempt component, which quantifies the part of the discrimination that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component, which quantifies the remaining discrimination. Our decomposition enables selective removal of the non-exempt component if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through examples and counterexamples that enable us to first obtain a set of desirable properties that any measure of non-exempt discrimination should satisfy. We then demonstrate that our proposed quantification of non-exempt discrimination satisfies all of them. This decomposition leverages a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure of non-exempt discrimination can satisfy all of the desired properties, which leads us to relax our goals and examine alternative observational measures that satisfy only some of these properties. We then perform a case study using one observational measure to show how one might train a model allowing for exemption of discrimination due to critical features. © 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.",,"Artificial intelligence; Critical features; Impossibility results; Novel information; Partial information; Selective removal; Information theory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106437452

Space science, technology and its applications can provide a wide range of solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thus contribute to achieving economic, social and environmental sustainable development. This paper addresses the contributions of space activities from three different perspectives: policy, strategy and technology. It focuses on a sub-set of challenges linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely global health, water, energy and urban development. The proposed strategy perspective considers elements, such as interdisciplinarity, spin-in and spin-off transfers, open innovation processes, and sustainability at large. Space exploration programmes are usually conceived around space mission requirements and technologies with a maturity level that allows for their implementation into planned technology roadmaps. Therefore, it is discussed how such roadmaps could better integrate policy and strategic aspects linked to sustainability on Earth. What if a system is efficiently designed to operate in space and at the same time allows for sustainable development on Earth? The further integration of key enabling technologies (big data, artificial intelligence systems, advanced robotics) are opening a new era in the exploration of other planets where autonomy is an essential requirement. At the same time such developments can become an integral part of the future developments on Earth, providing smart solutions to the citizens of tomorrow and opening up new business sectors associated to these spin-offs. For example, the development of Additive Layer Manufacturing technology will simplify the production of mechanical components and their logistic chain. However, it will also open up new ways of thinking on a large scale, for instance in the construction of buildings and structures using local materials, such as Moon regolith or Earth sand. Other examples are In Situ Resource Utilisation and viewing a building or a city as a spaceship system, which will not only allow space habitats to include self-regenerative functions, but also allow smart cities on Earth to become greener and more sustainable, especially in view of the expansion of population, the resulting densification and increase of urban areas. The aim of the strategy proposed in this paper is to approach sustainability for development from a holistic perspective looking not only at a product of space technology and how one could transfer this into a terrestrial application but also at strategies for achieving spin-offs in compliance with the most urging topics of this century. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agenda 2030; Future space technology; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105998345

The advancement of the 4IR technologies introduced the era of digital technology, whereby all sectors, government institutions, small and medium enterprises are seeking these technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and machine learning to name but few. Yet, there is a perception that the South African manufacturing sector is lagging behind with the adoption of these advanced technologies. Moreover, some of these manufacturers are still depending on their traditional methods and conventional machine tools. Meanwhile, the era of digital technology has presented these tools with sectors that had successfully achieved a competitive advantage within the marketplace. As a result, this paper analyses the factors contributing to economic growth and sustainability in relation to the adoption and usage of new technologies. The paper provides some insights into the readiness and adaption of the South African manufacturing sector of the new technologies as well as the global conformity with 4IR. Sectors are being forced to rethink their business processes and the way they conduct business. In response to the challenges deriving from globalization, manufacturing companies today face the need for more flexible and agile manufacturing equipment. Also, the pressure has been posed by their competitors that have taken advantage of these technologies and noted significant improvement in cost reduction, cycle time, productivity, and safety issues. Clearly, the usage of the industry 4.0 tools such as automation, robotics, smart production, artificial intelligence, and big data presents opportunities. From the South African manufacturing perspective, 4IR is challenging a sector that has been in decline for the past decade due to a lack of adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. Whereas this sector is one of the sectors that is expected to strengthen economic growth and job creation. Findings suggest that there is a need to rethink the current production systems in order to develop a manufacturing digital transformation model that enables the conversion to smart factories, automation processes, real-time data of production process, and marketplace. The findings also revealed that there are few component elements that need serious attention, namely, ICT infrastructure, high tech skilled retention, development of the high-tech skilled workforce, particularly digitally skilled workers-which is the main problem in both developed and developing countries. © IEOM Society International.","Digital technology; Economic growth; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105596104

This was predicted by Eric Emerson Schmidt, the former C.E.O. of Google over 20 years ago. The physical world is now connecting to the digital world so quickly with the emergence of the IoT that it seems the Internet will become invisible soon, meaning the physical world will be connecting to the digital world seamlessly. The world will enjoy smart connectivity in the same way that the city of Barcelona has emerged to be the smartest city in the world. We are moving toward system-to-system connection, with smart networking reaching its peak. The idea of software-defined autonomous machines is about to become hugely important, which will become ubiquitous. With the advent of the IoT, we explore how it is becoming a reality and whether it has any limits. Maciej Kranz in his book on the IoT explains the very essential detailed and inclusive idea of the IoT, with IoT expanding to businesses, and covering and impacting on a variety of technology areas. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have a huge scope because of the enormous data generated by sensors and devices connected through the IoT. We will explore in this chapter the hype around the IoT and the reality. We will also discover improved metrics in the IoT that is allowing it to be a leader in the technological world. We are witnessing the fourth revolution in the digitization world and discuss the reasons behind its exponential growth. The protocols that differentiate them from others have evolved for IOT in a new set of patterns. This also creates security concerns and data are described as the new oil, raising further challenges of data privacy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, in the era of Industry4.0, this results into an extremely complex scenario requiring new business models and involve the whole value chain, and representing an opportunity as well. Moreover, in order to properly consider the environmental pillar of sustainability, the quality of available information represents a challenge in taking appropriate decisions, considering inhomogeneity of data sources, asynchronous nature of data sampling in terms of clock time and frequency, and different available volumes. In this sense, Big Data techniques and tools are fundamental in order to handle, analyze and process such heterogeneity, to provide a timely and meaningful data and information interpretation for making exploitation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence possible. Handling and fully exploiting the complexity of the current monitoring and automation systems calls for deep exploitation of advanced modelling and simulation techniques to define and develop proper Environmental Decision Support Systems. Such systems are expected to extensively support plant managers and operators in taking better, faster and more focused decisions for improving the environmental footprint of production processes, while preserving optimal product quality and smooth process operation. The paper describes a vision from the steel industry on the way in which the above concepts can be implemented in the steel sector through some application examples aimed at improving socio-economic and environmental sustainability of production cycles. © SCF, 2021.","Artificial Intelligence; Carbon neutrality; Digitalization; Environmental footprint; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Steel industry","Automation; Decision support systems; Industrial economics; Machine learning; Steelmaking; Application examples; Data and information; Environmental decision support systems; Environmental footprints; Environmental sustainability; Industrial symbiosis; Modelling and simulations; Techniques and tools; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104989369

It argues that algorithmic economy demonstrates peculiarities that the EU legislator could not have taken into account when enacting EU competition law. The judicial adaptation of the pertinent provisions in force to contemporary business practices deploying smart technology reflects inevitably economic and political aspirations which have not been yet crystalized at EU level. This causes contradictory court decisions and legal uncertainty. Moreover, the autonomy of smart software raises liability and enforcement concerns. To resolve these issues, European Jurisprudence needs to consult technological feedback, which is though constantly revised and updated. In view of these challenges, this paper advocates the need of a reformed regulatory regime for competition in the EU, which is responsive to the competitive risks posed by the increasing AI involvement in business practice.

The technological revolution with new products and services is transforming the market and business operators. There is a general understanding that new technological improvements benefit competition. The question is, whether competition models are adequate and ready to deal with the challenges associated with new technologies. In recent years, there has been a revived interest in the concept of innovation and its application in competition policy and law. However, proper examination of its influence on competition policy is lacking. During the last decades, there have been attempts to explain the relationship between competition and innovation by including various innovation models in competition analysis. The innovation instruments have developed. Despite these developments, there are still diametrically opposed theoretical approaches, from completely ignoring the concept of innovation in competition law to the ones that develop a specific economic test in competition analysis. This paper will try to analyze and compare different approaches to the intersection of competition and innovation. Systematic theories that assess innovation in the context of competition are scarce. Competition authorities have been focused on issues of consumer and social welfare, rather than on the impact of innovation on the competition. The idea is to try to define the role of innovation in competition analysis. The question is whether competition law needs new tools in order to understand new developments and innovations. The authors argue that competition has its own instruments that can be applied to new models with certain adaptations. Certain regulatory instruments are necessary, but they can be implemented without stifling innovation and the development of new technologies. The authors attempt to offer possible solutions for the existing challenges based on the state of art research. The challenges associated with the market definition and market power are explained. It is argued that competition analyses should acknowledge that innovation is essential for competition in the digital era. © 2020 University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics and Business.

Yet, leveraging AI effectively requires high investments. To reduce these investments, companies can implement AI capabilities directly via boundary resources such as application programming interfaces (APIs). However, research tells us little about antecedents and performance consequences of the use of AI boundary resources. To close this gap, we derive hypotheses from the resource-based view and the relational view of competitive advantages and test these hypotheses on a panel dataset of S&P 500 firms for the years 2010 to 2018. Our results show that firms with high levels of internal AI capabilities are particularly likely to adopt AI boundary resources for process improvements; firms with high external market pressure are positively associated to use AI boundary resources for customer solutions; and the use of AI boundary resources has a positive performance effect. © ICIS 2020.

Despite this growing trend, there has been little research regarding the impact of using MLFs on statistical inference for empirical research. In this paper, we undertake feature identification and parameter estimation issues related to the use of topics/features extracted by Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a popular machine learning technique for text mining. We propose a novel method to extract features that result in the minimum-variance estimation of the regression model parameters. This enables a better use of unstructured text data for econometric modeling in empirical research.

One of the performance-based approaches to facilitate pavement management decision-making processes is the use of remaining service life (RSL) models. In this study, a detailed step-by-step methodology for the development of pavement performance and RSL prediction models for flexible and composite (asphalt concrete [AC] over jointed plain concrete pavement [JPCP]) pavement systems in Iowa is described. To develop such RSL models, pavement performance models based on statistics and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques were initially developed. While statistically defined pavement performance models were found to be accurate in predicting pavement performance at project level, AI-based pavement performance models were found to be successful in predicting pavement performance in network level analysis. Network level pavement performance models using both statistics and AI-based approaches were also developed to evaluate the relative success of these two models for network level pavement performance modeling. As part of this study, in the development of pavement RSL prediction models, automation tools for future pavement performance predictions were developed and used along with the threshold limits for various pavement performance indicators specified by the Federal Highway Administration. These RSL models will help engineers in decision-making processes at both network and project levels and for different types of pavement management business decisions. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Artificial intelligence; Concrete pavements; Concretes; Decision making; Forecasting; Highway administration; Decision making process; Federal Highway Administration; Federal transportation; Jointed plain concrete pavements; Pavement performance modeling; Performance based approach; Service life prediction; State highway agencies; Predictive analytics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102876067

Websites, leaflets and audiovisual materials of 139 CIs around the world (theaters, art galleries, opera houses, museums) were analyzed. It was found that CIs use both complementary (CT) as well as substitutive technologies (ST) for managerial and mission-oriented purposes. In our article, the matrix of technologies used by CIs is proposed. Our findings suggest that CIs adapt to changing technological environment by implementing tools that support them in the mission’s fulfillment and management. Moreover, new technologies are used by CIs as both employees’ reinforcement as well as their replacement. © 2020, University of Split - Faculty of Economics.

Nowadays this practice is widely acknowledged and successful in federal megacities, for example, Moscow is one of the TOP-5 megacities in the world with high digital readiness of urban infrastructure.

The aim of this article is to study artificial intelligence as a general-purpose technology, its distribution features and approaches to assessing and modelling the impact on production, organization finances and the economy. The study employed the methods of an AI qualitative analysis according to the classification of general-purpose technologies and a regression analysis of company production factors. The author analysed the data of 21 public Russian companies in the industry of hydrocarbon production, mining and metal production for 2014-2018. He proposed a model to assess the impact of AI technology on production, organization finances and the economy. The correlation analysis proved that capital expenditures and the market value of companies have a close relationship. The study revealed low productivity of assets of Russian companies. The investor expects to receive 28 kopecks for each rouble invested in the company's assets, whereas foreign markets show a one to one ratio. The study highlighted the cyclicality of the performance of the company factors. The research did not expose general-purpose technology signals in the given time interval. The author concluded that under a quality classification, artificial intelligence is a general-purpose technology; however, at this stage, it is impossible to empirically observe the economic effect of the technology distribution. The proposed model may be of further use to study the effect of artificial intelligence on the finances of a company and the economy. The potential consequences of market monopolization due to the distribution of AI technologies allow for an argument for the state regulation of the technology adaptation process by business. © Rasskazov V.E., 2020","Analysis of production factors; Artificial Intelligence; Economic analysis; Financial; General-purpose technology; J-curve; Solow's paradox",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101915110

Several access control models have been proposed, but most of the existing models could not provide flexible, fine-grained access control in SaaS. The H-RBAC model which inherits the flexibility of the RBAC model cannot balance fine-grained permission assignment and effective control of the complexity of authorization management. This paper proposes a SaaS resource authorization management model based on resource directed tree, which is improved based on the H-RBAC model. In this model, the resource directed trees in which the resources of SaaS platform are organized by business logic, are introduced between roles and resources in the HRBAC model, and the role permissions are assigned based on the directed tree to reduce the workload of authorization management. At the same time, based on the resource directed tree, an attribute-based permission reduction method which combines the ABAC and RBAC is introduced. It not only effectively controls the workload of authorization management, but also ensures that session permissions are constrained fine-grained and dynamically. © 2020 IEEE.","Attribute-based; Authorization management; Resource directed tree; Role permission; SaaS","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forestry; Access control models; Attribute-based; Authorization management; Business logic; Directed trees; Reduction method; Saas platforms; Security issues; Access control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101469222

From a demand side, the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing and particularly deep learning requires large amounts of data. From a supply side, new technology, such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and 5G mobile communications, will greatly expand data generation. However, data has remained a challenge. In data analytics companies are struggling with too much time spent on data preparation. As of today, data preparation for analytics has largely remained handmade and made-to-order like cars before Henry Ford industrialized the auto business through productization of cars and parts, and factory automation. Similarly, for data analytics to become a bigger business, data has to be productized. First “data factories” are emerging to create such data products economically. This article introduces a framework to guide construction of a data factory: What are the key modules, why are they important, how is best practice evolving? The article is building on (a) a foundation and in-depth case studies in the literature, (b) current meta research and systematic literature reviews (SLRs), and (c) our own observations building a data factory.

Research on the business value of information technology (IT) suggests that the adoption of AI should improve organizational performance, though indirectly, through improved business processes and other mediators, but research so far has not extensively empirically investigated the way AI creates business value. The paper proposes a capability-based view of AI adoption based on the conception that, with the adoption of AI, an organization develops AI-enabled capabilities – abilities to mobilize AI resources to effectively exploit, create, extend, or modify its resource base.

Fortunately, the companies impacted by anomalous behaviour are also generating more data and insights on potential anomalous cases than ever before. In this paper, a unified approach to managing the complexity of constructing a useable anomaly detection system is presented. The unified approach is comprised of three algorithms, a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) implementation for autoencoders, an anomaly score threshold optimisation algorithm, and a Gaussian scaling function for anomaly scores. NAS is applied to a data set containing instances of credit card fraud. The NAS algorithm is used to simulate a population of 50 candidate deep learning architectures, with the best performing architecture being selected based on a balanced score, comprised of an average of the Area under the ROC curve, Average Precision and normalised Matthews Correlation Coefficient scores. The threshold optimisation algorithm is used to determine the appropriate threshold between the classes, for the purposes of producing the binary classification outcome of each architecture. The Gaussian scaling algorithm is applied to the raw anomaly scores of the optimal architecture into order to generate useable probability scores. Not only did the proposed unified approach simplify the process of selecting an optimal neural architecture whose output is interpretable by business practitioners and comparable with other probability score producing models, but it also contributes to anomaly detection in a transactional setting by eliminating subjective thresholds when classifying anomalous transactions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Evolutionary computations; Neural networks","Data Science; Deep learning; Learning systems; Optimization; Anomaly detection systems; Area under the ROC curve; Binary classification; Business practitioners; Correlation coefficient; Learning architectures; Neural architectures; Optimal architecture; Anomaly detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101400825

PBPM techniques aim to improve process performance by providing predictions to process analysts, supporting them in their decision making. However, the PBPM techniques’ limited predictive quality was considered as the essential obstacle for establishing such techniques in practice. With the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), the techniques’ predictive quality could be improved for tasks like the next activity prediction. While DNNs achieve a promising predictive quality, they still lack comprehensibility due to their hierarchical approach of learning representations. Nevertheless, process analysts need to comprehend the cause of a prediction to identify intervention mechanisms that might affect the decision making to secure process performance. In this paper, we propose XNAP, the first explainable, DNN-based PBPM technique for the next activity prediction. XNAP integrates a layer-wise relevance propagation method from the field of explainable artificial intelligence to make predictions of a long short-term memory DNN explainable by providing relevance values for activities.

Strategic innovation involves high uncertainties better addressed through agile methods and a collaborative approach [1–3]. Key success factors in delivering ITO/BPO innovation are high-quality relationships, trust and collaborative cultures [1–4], and establishing an effective governance configuration. The authors report on longitudinal case studies of a global mining company (“GMC”) and a group of its suppliers aimed at understanding how GMC is developing “big data” applications to generate game-changing innovation. This paper describes how GMC has developed a “big data” platform to support internal staff, customers, consultants and third party suppliers to create applications that can transform global mining and smelting industries to deliver a price premium for GMC’s products. GMC has encountered a shortage of suitably experienced data scientists in its key operating locations resulting in a significant skills gap in its big data program. GMC’s sourcing strategy aims to build an open and collaborative ecosystem that draws upon secondary markets to help fill the skills gap. To create an environment in which open innovation [5] can flourish, GMC established an Analytics Speed Team (AST) as an internal consulting and program management group to drive faster progress with big data applications. A contribution of this research is to identify the role of AST in establishing an effective governance configuration for open innovation. A practical contribution is made by analysing the value of secondary markets for ITO services in a sourcing ecosystem optimised for delivering innovation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cloud services; Innovation in outsourcing/offshoring; Secondary markets; Sourcing configuration; Sourcing ecosystem; “Gig” economy","Application programs; Big data; Commerce; Ecosystems; Human resource management; Big data applications; Business process outsourcing; Collaborative approach; Key success factors; Longitudinal case study; Program management group; Sourcing strategies; Strategic innovations; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101311865

This issue is especially acute in medicine. The article discusses the social, motivational and organizational aspects of this problem. As a means to increase the volume of freely distributed medical datasets the creation of a publicly accessible Internet-resource is proposed, which would combine the work of students and young professionals, led by expert radiologists, as well as IT professionals involved in improving markup tools and building datasets. Participating in such kind of work will leverage the motivation of mature specialists and the professional level of young ones. Patients and their attending physicians who wish to promptly receive a second (expert) report on the diagnosis and course of the disease and who agree to use their information anonymously to form datasets will provide the flow of input information. Through an expert survey, we identified the requirements for such a resource. The main business process of such a resource and its system architecture are represented. We conducted experimental studies of the main functionalities of the developed service in terms of meeting the user's requirements as well as a security audit.

From another point of view, the cost associated with sub-orbital space access flight is strongly conditioned by the still small dimension and uncertainties of its market. Therefore, hypersonic technologies and vehicle design suitable for this market as well as for point-to-point fast transportation can facilitate the endeavour. A Mach<5 Horizontal Take-off Horizontal Landing (HTHL) business-jet-sized vehicle is widely recognized to be more technologically affordable than larger hypersonic aircraft and even more feasible from an economic point of view. It will be based on more readily state-of-art available technologies like titanium alloys for its structure which are suitable to manage the levels of heat produced on external surfaces at those speeds and turboramjet engines, instead of less proven scramjets required for faster aircrafts. No disruptive or presently low-TRL technology is necessary, rather enhancing already available innovations (e.g. artificial intelligence for GNC and onboard systems, virtual/expanded reality, heat pipes for passive heat control). Attention is given to maintaining high level of environmental protection, especially in terms of sonic boom effects on ground, global and local pollution and noise emissions. The scientific and industrial background of the members of the Campania Aerospace District (DAC) includes leadership and participation in projects like USV, Phoebus, Hytam, IXV, Lapcat, Space Rider, Hexafly, Hyplane, Stratofly. Based on this heritage, with specific reference to the HYPLANE concept and coherently with the Smart Specialization Strategy of its Region, DAC is focusing on enhancing technologies compliant with small supersonic/hypersonic business jet for passenger transport and suborbital aircraft for microgravity experimentation, training and tourism. To flight validate the system and related technologies, a multi-mission Single Stage Suborbital Spaceplane (S4) demonstrator is proposed. A dedicated working group is in place at DAC, formed by representatives of industries (large enterprises as well as SMEs), several research organizations and universities. In parallel DAC is supporting the development of the Campanian Grazzanise airport to become a spaceport in the frame of a Suborbital TEst Polygon (STEP) proposed to be established between Campania and Sardinia regions.

With the advance of space exploration, increasingly complex space missions are in urgent need of the support of artificial intelligence. However, the spacecraft with intelligence is a great challenge. Firstly, there are not enough AI professionals in aerospace applications. Traditional technicians are usually very proficient in the aerospace industry, but they generally do not have experience in artificial intelligence. Secondly, compared with the traditional mission in computer vision, the aerospace applications are usually more complicated. They are usually composed of multiple neural networks, which significantly increases the difficulty of development. Finally, the network model is mainly deployed on the commercial GPU platform in most businesses. However, the trained model must be deployed on the specialized hardware platform for aerospace applications, which is not a trivial work. Therefore, how to provide rapid model design, training, and deployment aimed at complex aerospace application scenarios has become a hot topic. In this paper, we have designed a deep learning development platform for spacecraft intelligence, which can provide different customized services for basic and advanced users. Firstly, this platform can visualize the design and training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), thus greatly simplifies network design and super parameter adjustment. In intelligent application, it makes developers pay more attention to business, rather than model design and training. Secondly, according to different scenarios, we design different granularity deep network models and components to create a model library. Through the dynamic assembly of multiple models, designers can realize the rapid models' integration of complex aerospace applications. Finally, based on the aerospace intelligent hardware platform, we can achieve the efficient deployment and schedule multiple intelligent models. With CNN's quantization and pruning, the trained model is further accelerated without significant performance degradation. The aerospace engineers, who are not very proficient in artificial intelligence, can use our development platform to produce the intelligence algorithm models for aerospace missions rapidly. Our platform can provide essential support for intelligent aerospace applications and promote the rapid development of aerospace intelligence.

Indeed, one or two satellites are not enough anymore to address applications relative to national security, disaster management or commercial monitoring. To answer these needs, Airbus put two satellite products on the market, the S250 optical and S250 radar. They are designed with constellations and complementarity in mind. An advanced ground segment ensures that customers can maximally exploit the great reactivity and huge acquisition capacity that come with a system combining several of these satellites. The paper describes one of the major implications of such constellations on the ground segment: the satellites can easily flood end users with image products of multiple types, therefore image analysis is necessary to automatically extract first level of information fast enough, allowing analysts to concentrate on their main skills and concerns. This way a decision can be made quickly whether to reprogram the constellation's acquisition plans, potentially crosscueing between optical and radar observations. The paper goes into the topics Airbus has been working on for endowing its systems with operational capabilities of image analysis using AI technologies. Technical and programmatic questions must be treated in many areas: training of new Machine Learning algorithms and re-training of existing ones on the new sensor products, the qualification, monitoring and maintenance of the algorithms and of the end-products, the timeliness at which the end products must be produced, the alignment of products generated by optical and radar algorithms in view of feeding sensor agnostic analytics products, the standardisation of algorithm interfaces for future capability extensions, the sizing of the IT infrastructure. When tackling these topics, considerations on the customers' business needs and system level considerations are of central importance. © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

In the Industry 4.0 context, several terms are used to express the model, such as readiness assessment model, roadmap, framework, and maturity index. They have the same purpose of measuring how the current state of an organization unit is capable of adopting and implementing the concept of industry 4.0 in the future. Many researchers had proposed maturity models for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness and maturity since 2011 when Industry 4.0 was commenced. However, there has been no attempt to analyze empirical evidence systematically. This paper aims to analyze currently available maturity models related to Industry 4.0 and provide a synthesis on those maturity models. This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies implemented on the maturity model published in several reputable and relevant sources. It focuses on the manufacturing and logistics sectors since the processes in both sectors can be highly improved through the introduction of technologies such as cyber-physical systems, internet of things, and artificial intelligence. In general, the primary purpose of the review is to address the following questions: (1) Based on what dimensions do researchers develop Industry 4.0 maturity models, and what are the most used and influencing parameters in those dimensions? (2) How do those maturity models compare to each other in terms of dimension complexity, techniques, maturity leveling, and kind of application sectors of the model? In conclusion, the maturity model in the context of Industry 4.0 is promising to guide the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies at the organization level. However, just having a maturity model is not enough. More efforts are needed to facilitate the application of it. © 2020 The Authors.

The existing BI maturity models offer different views of the organization, with different levels of detail, establishing a difficulty in guiding the development of a BI project. This work aims to establish a life cycle of a BI project that is aligned with the BI maturity of an organization, so that the phases, activities and tasks of this type of project are related to those indicated by the maturity model used. After a process of selecting a BI maturity model to be used for each phase, a life cycle is proposed for a BI project, generating process assets for the phases and activities of the same. In particular, given the scale that represents the life cycle of a BI project, this work is limited to presenting details of this guide for the first phase of the defined life cycle, called Preliminary Analysis. Currently, this model of the life cycle of a BI project is being applied to a real case, after which data will be obtained to objectively evaluate its degree of completeness and practical utility in the development of this type of projects. © 2020, Universidad de Tarapaca.

In the era of ""Big Data,"" one of the key challenges is to analyze the large amounts of collected data in meaningful and scalable ways. Most process discovery algorithms assume that all the data in an event log fully comply with the process execution specification, and the process event logs are no exception. However, real event logs contain large amounts of noise and data from irrelevant infrequent behavior. The infrequent behavior or noise has a negative influence on the process discovery procedure. This article presents a technique to remove infrequent behavior from event logs by calculating the minimum expectation of the process event log. The method was evaluated in detail, and the results showed that its application in existing process discovery algorithms significantly improves the quality of the discovered process models and that it scales well to large datasets. © 2020 IGI Global.

In this sense, digital transformation means platformification, i.e. when business is developed through digital information systems connecting buyers with sellers, including third-party service providers. Financial institutes, while selling their native services on platforms and/or orchestrating platforms, are able to position their proposals as technological, thus making the modern financial mantra (“Work like Google”) true.

The term has been in use for over 30 years, it has been an established field of study for over 25, and this is the 21st ECKM. But how much has KM changed in that time? This paper considers that question by briefly comparing articles dated 1999 in the Web of Science database with those in 2019, and then looking in depth at practical case studies of KM published in 2019 according to that same database. It is common knowledge that the technology available has improved vastly during KM's history, but how has this impacted on other aspects of KM? Major themes from the earliest days of KM, such as repositories and communities of practice, are still highly visible in the literature. The approach taken in this paper is to use a people-processes-technology framework, separate the business processes from the knowledge processes that support them, and examine the linkages between the three elements of the people-processes-technology framework for both types of process. Current research shows processes to be the most studied of the three elements, especially the link whereby people help to design and then operate processes. The technological advances that have had most effect on KM are in technologies for general application. This is in contrast to the focus of technology research in KM in the 1990s, which had been on specific technologies for KM. Whether the latest technologies for artificial intelligence and analytics are general or specific to KM is a moot point, and probably depends on the background of the person you ask. The weakest current linkages are clearly those in which people should be helping to design the technology in use. Analytics developments in particular are as likely to be inflicted on the users/customers as to be designed by them. Artificial intelligence developments for KM in 2019 do not even include practical case studies, which is worrying. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

The digitisation of the construction industry is becoming very important as processes, quality and efficiency are being focused on a lot more. Within the construction industry, knowledge management (KM) is a key part of learning from past mistakes on previous projects. As part of Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the technologies that could provide a potential to the construction industry through gathering knowledge from previous projects to determine future project outcomes. Therefore, this research focusses on AI and its abilities to improve KM for the construction industry in the UK. Qualitative research approach was adopted to collect and analyse the data. A total of 10 semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers within the construction industry. Results show that organisation have already implemented some sort of AI systems within projects and organisations in order to allow for better KM. Combining AI systems into Common Data Environments can help employees in finding documents easier with a unique ID or referenced words. It is concluded that AI systems can be built and used in order to assist with the KM processes that businesses have already implemented. It is recommended that there is a need for developing a business model canvas of implementing AI to benefit from KM within organisations in order to identify the difference between the business processes without AI for KM and with AI being used to assist KM. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

These are both companies making their living of understanding the future of work both on a corporate level. We did the interviews in April 2019 and during the Coronavirus in April 2020. The findings: 1.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics will be an incremental revolution introduced step by step. 2.The Coronavirus has reorganized work as online work at home, and a more significant part of the online work willorganize as online digital work at home and virtual teamwork. 3.Video conferences have come to stay, giving less business traveling. 4.Greener national supply-chains will partly replace the global supply chains. 5.The workforce will be more disciplined and loyal, have better competence (knowledge, skills, and attitudes), andmore women as middle managers and top managers. 6.The incentive system will be based more upon an internal corporate pipeline. 7.The corporations will take a more energetic responsibility for greener solutions and the climate. 8.The households will be using more reused goods, traveling less, and have a greener living focus. The difference between April 2019 to April 2020 is that online homework is the actual work situation in March-April 2020, and the interviewed believe that 50% of the work will be done online outside the workplace. The corona crisis changed the way we are working for the future.

The construction of ecological urbanism is becoming an increasingly important issue given the ongoing climate change. On the other hand, ecological urbanism is associated with the possibilities for planning and building sustainable architecture and the use of green technologies in caring for the sustainability of the city. The need for an ecological approach as a means of rehabilitating the modern city is essential in organizational terms for the construction of the new cities of the future. The development of the concept of smart cities presupposes the connection of ecology with urban development, as well as with the multilayered, diverse and nuanced understanding of ecological urbanism and the aesthetics of the urban environment. Definitely in the future development of cities investments will be concentrated in the places that are managed smart, with the help of modern information and communication technologies. Urban development will be important for improving the quality of life in the coming years, as more and more attention will be paid to the sustainable development of cities, which must be the result of the use of artificial intelligence in combining smart governance with new technologies. On the other hand, with the improvement of business conditions, the improvement of the existing and the construction of new green infrastructure will become a prerequisite both for retaining the populations of the people living in these cities and for their stimulating development and their transformation into green's sustainable smart cities of the future. In this process, the role of the civil sector as a catalyst in the development and use of green technologies in the field of urban planning and development must not be forgotten. In addition, the fact that border towns are not large implies the rapid and flexible implementation of new solutions in the construction of ecological urbanism in these areas. The purpose of this report is to present the possibilities for building ecological urbanism based on the analysis of the socio-economic development of separate territories and at the same time to indicate the main directions in which all subject in public sector will have to work to achieve sustainable balanced regional development the territory of the border municipalities in the two neighboring countries the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Serbia.

It considers the perception among the top management about the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and further measures the readiness of private commercial banks (PCBs) to become resilient. Design/methodology/approach: This study attempts to measure the perception and readiness of the commercial banking sector because of the 4IR based on the stratified sampling method. The research is qualitative and selected PCBs listed in the Dhaka Stock Exchange. 4IR in the context of the banking sector in Bangladesh is a problem that has not been studied more clearly, intended to establish priorities, develop operational definitions and improve the final research design. Findings: This research has identified a significant gap of study in the preparedness among the private commercial banking sector in Bangladesh to confront the 4IR while indicating the most significant risks and managerial insights. The findings show technologies will dramatically change the nature of work. Traditional system of banking from the branch will be shifting into banking from everywhere. Hence, digital products and services will foster value-driven business. The result of the study also states the readiness of the banking sector is in the preliminary stage and endorses some of the coping approaches. Research limitations/implications: Different schools of thought regarding the role of the 4IR and its future consequences have been observed. The corporate sector in Bangladesh has an inclusive lack of understanding regarding the 4IR. Practical implications: The insights may provide directions to banking financial institutions of Bangladesh to thrive during the 4IR. This study is intended to assist policymakers, decision-makers and employees of PCBs to increase awareness and preparedness for future challenges that may appear from the 4IR where the 41 competitive PCBs play vital role in turning the fast emerging Bangladesh economy. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper associates with academics and bankers to increase understanding of coping in the context of the escalating use of emerging technology-driven banking services within the PCBs in Bangladesh by determining perception and testing different forms of readiness including a variety of important outcomes such as risks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Blockchain; Commercial banks; Fourth Industrial Revolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099415608

The premise of this paper is to demonstrate the need for enterprise systems to evolve from being data and information oriented to intelligence sharing systems capitalizing on modern-day technologies of AI and machine learning. A collaborative enterprise system results from sophistication in communications technologies combined with vastly dispersed big data and its accompanying analytics. Collaborations within an enterprise system framework comprise multiple Cloud-based big data storages, sourcing of data from end-user IoT devices and back-end servers, storage and security of data, execution of business processes across multiple organizations and offering Analytics-as-a-Service to the users and consumers. Furthermore, the intelligence within these collaborations utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide continuous optimization and efficient decision-making processes for the entire enterprise eco-system. The outcome of our study is the delineation of a conceptual framework examining key elements that comprise ICES. We analysed the evolution of ICES, and how big data and its analytics based on techniques of artificial Intelligence improves decision making and prediction.

Accounting and auditing areas are also quite affected by this transformation. Another important result of technology and digitalization is the rapid increase in errors, frauds, and irregularities. Enterprises are looking for new solutions and investigations against irregularities and frauds. Audits for errors, frauds, or irregularities are among the interests of forensic accounting. Many methods are used to identify errors and frauds in the forensic accounting. However, it is inevitable that digital technologies should be utilized in forensic accounting applications as a result of the rapid spread of automation and computer programs in enterprises within the framework of digitalized business activities. Hence, enterprises will be able to get more effective results through computer programs and artificial intelligence in terms of fraud audit in forensic accounting. Expert system applications use artificial intelligence to enable computer programs to behave just like people. One of the most widely used, most easily applicable, and most understandable types of expert system is rule-based expert system. The aim of this study is to determine the accounting fraud that may occur in enterprises within the framework of forensic accounting through rule-based expert systems. For this purpose, various applications have been implemented in a large-scale production enterprise through the use of rule-based expert systems for the determination of accounting fraud. Benford’s Law, risk levels, and various other criteria were used in the creation of expert systems. According to the results obtained from the study, it has been seen that by means of rule-based expert system applications, enterprises can better detect existing frauds and prevent further irregularities in the future. The study is important and it is expected that the study will contribute to the literature because it is shown in the study that the rule-based expert systems, applied in many fields under the title of social sciences, can also be applied in the field of forensic accounting and auditing. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Currently the traditional fashion business models are experiencing a paradigm shift from being an experience-based business strategy implementation to a data driven intelligent business improvisation. Artificial Intelligence is acting as a catalyst to achieve the infusion of data intelligence into the fashion industry which aims at fostering all the business brackets such as supply chain management, trend analysis, fashion recommendation, sales forecasting, digitized shopping experience etc. The field of “Fashion AI’’ is still under research progress because the fashion data is a multifaceted entity which is available in any of the forms like an image, video, text and numerical values. Therefore, it becomes a challenging research arena. There is a paucity of a common study which can provide a bird's eye view about the research efforts and directions. In this paper, the authors represent a bibliometric survey of the AI based fashion analysis domain based on the Scopus database. The study was conducted by retrieving 581 Scopus research papers published from 1975-2020 and analysed to find out critical insights such as publication volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. The study revealed that significant contribution is made via concept propositions in conferences and some papers published in the journal.

In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After having been introduced to sales and marketing departments, artificial intelligence is also starting to guide employee-related decisions within HR management. The purpose is to support decisions that are based not on subjective aspects but on objective data analysis. The goal of this work is to analyse how objective factors influence employee attrition, in order to identify the main causes that contribute to a worker’s decision to leave a company, and to be able to predict whether a particular employee will leave the company. After the training, the obtained model for the prediction of employees’ attrition is tested on a real dataset provided by IBM analytics, which includes 35 features and about 1500 samples. Results are expressed in terms of classical metrics and the algorithm that produced the best results for the available dataset is the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. It reveals the best recall rate (0.54), since it measures the ability of a classifier to find all the positive instances and achieves an overall false negative rate equal to 4.5% of the total observations. © 2020 by the authors.

This Data has the potential to help increase revenue collections through targeted compliance initiatives, expanding the tax base, and improving overall operational efficiency. Tax administrations, therefore have an opportunity to deliver value in this new era of digital tax by embracing enterprise initiatives and transformations that facilitate enhanced Data utilization. To enhance the use of Data analytics there is a need for a shift in mind-set around how Data is managed and analyzed. Kenya Revenue Authority implemented a transformation agenda titled â€ Towards being an insight driven Tax Authority', aimed at drastically enhancing the Authority's performance in a rapidly changing environment. This would see the enterprise leverage on Data warehousing, business intelligence and advanced analytical skills and tools to transform Data management and utilization. To optimize the value of analytics there has been initiatives towards integrating with big Data sources including Data sourced from third parties. This transformation can only happen if there is a deliberate initiative to build Data literacy including skills in Data mining, modelling, artificial intelligence; among others.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) software systems and connected information management can help handle the discontinuities in critical business tasks. AI Incident Management (AIIM) becomes therefore a set of practices and tools to resolve incidents by means of AI-enabled organizational processes and methodologies. The software automation of AIIM could reduce unplanned interruptions of service and let customers resume their work as quick as possible. While several techniques were presented in the literature to automatically identify the problems described in incident tickets by customers, this paper focuses on the qualitative analysis of the provided descriptions and on using such analysis within the context of an AI-enabled business organizational process. When an incident ticket does not describe properly the problem, the analyst must ask the customer for additional details which could require several long-lasting interactions. This paper overviews ACQUA, an AIIM approach that uses machine-learning to automatically assess the quality of ticket descriptions with the goals of removing the need of additional communications and guiding the customers to properly describe the incident. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Artificial intelligence; Digital transformation; Incident Management; Natural Language Processing; Service continuity","Information management; Quality of service; Sales; Critical business; Customer managements; Incident Management; Organizational process; Qualitative analysis; Quality assessment; Software automation; Software systems; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098266010

BPMN models are prevalent in industry and offer modeling flexibility, but the models are often incomplete, since they are not derived from theoretically-based, consistent coordination patterns. This study addresses the need to develop a DEMO modeling tool that incorporates the novel feature of transforming user-selected parts of a validated OCD, consistently and in a semi-automated way, into BPMN collaboration diagrams.

To exploit all the techniques of Business Process Management and Process Mining, process models need to be represented in a formal (or semi-formal) representation, the process model diagram. However, manually obtaining an initial process model out of a process description document is a time consuming and cost intensive operation. Some initial solutions to address the challenge of process extraction from text have been proposed in the literature. But, the analysis of state of the art contributions reveals that this line of research has not reached its maturity yet and that process extraction from text can be considered an unresolved problem still in an early stage of development. Indeed, these contributions mainly adopt ad-hoc solutions based on rules, word-lists, and heuristics. In this paper, we adopt the instrument of qualitative analysis on state-of-the-art approaches and tools to shed light on current limitations of the process extraction from text area. In addition to an analysis of the main reference papers we test reference tools on samples of text extracted from real documents describing Standard Operating Procedures that exhibit a greater complexity than the publicly available procedural descriptions so far used as reference text by the process extraction from text community. The analysis reveals the inability for those approaches to perform well in real scenarios. The discussion of the results illustrates open points, fundamental challenges to solve, and gaps to fill. It also suggests new ideas on how to tackle some of the identified limitations which we intend to pursue in the future. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

The development of the basic foundation becomes the mother of science, such as mathematics, as a suspicion of the birth of new sciences. The interests related to the life and welfare of humans always invites the possibility of the birth of science in concepts, but mathematics confirms it. In certain cases, as an application, or it gives birth to answers in technology form, which is distorted according to the social demands of society. Every science has its methodology, which is based on the logic that helps to reason. A natural model is an approach to generating methods, as well as the principles that develop in artificial intelligence based on mathematics. This principle not only changes the way of perceiving data, but it also establishes new definitions of data, and changes statistics, optimization, and other fields. Each science also has implications for other sciences but also has applications that are also related to other sciences. Every science supports technology to improve social welfare. Historically, century by century, many new scientific fields were born, and it has evidence from the publication of scientific works to books as scientific standards. Then, the teaching curricula supported its initial dissemination and its development through research with evidence of scientific publications either through papers in proceedings of scientific meetings or articles in the journals. A study program about science in the related faculty is mandatory, and it is as the spearhead in further scientific and technological development. So everything starts and ends at one point, namely the birth of new science, as the birth of data science. This paper describes the birth of science by involving historical traces. The reflection of scientific development is starting from the foundation to become a scientific field, namely data science. It also illustrates the roadmap of a scientific indirectly. © 2020 M. K. M.

The data gathered in smart cities can be a crucial business asset of a company or an organization, and therefore it must be adequately protected, taking advantage of appropriate cryptography and encryption methods. The issue with encrypted data is the need to decrypt it to utilize it, for example, in teaching machine learning models, such as neural networks. Utilizing sophisticated cryptography methods, e.g., homomorphic encryption or adversarial neural cryptography (ANC cryptography), provide means in using the encrypted data without revealing it to third parties, like public cloud providers. These kinds of cryptography methods allow specific types of computations to be done in the encrypted ciphertext format providing results that are also encrypted in the ciphertext instead of decrypting the data first.

This analysis is based on up-to-date papers and case studies concerning recent developments in a global labour market faced with the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence technologies and data on the national Polish labour market collected by the Central Statistical Office (GUS), Poland’s government agency in charge of collecting and publishing statistical data regarding Poland’s economy, population, and society, both nationwide and locally. This article contributes to the efforts and work of policy makers, the senior and middle managers responsible for the sourcing and deployment of AI solutions in businesses, researchers, journalists, social scientists, and enthusiasts of artificial intelligence. This paper discusses the possible ways artificial intelligence will challenge the Polish labour market. This analysis shows that Poland is a country that will have to weather the significant adverse impact of artificial intelligence growth on workforce employment. The latest data concerning the labour market of Poland forecasts a struggle with artificial intelligence solutions, with this being based on reports from leading consulting firms, private businesses, outlook papers, compilations, and academic articles. All of these aforementioned sources have been used to assess the overall potential impact of AI on the labour market. Estimates derived from this analysis demonstrate that over 10 million people in Poland who are currently employed in low-skilled positions across different sectors of the economy including public administration, healthcare, transport, and logistics, will be replaced by machines as a result of automation. Indeed, should the current workforce fail to retrain or requalify to satisfy future labour market requirements within the 10-year perspective covered by the estimates, unemployment in Poland is forecast to skyrocket to nearly 40%. However, when analysing the impact of AI and robotization on the labour market, another factor should also be taken into account, namely the so called efficiency effect, the increase of labour demands caused by the higher efficiency of industrial production. The overall result of the interaction of these opposing factors is very difficult to predict. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.","Artificial intelligence; Industry 4.0; Labour market; Technological unemployment","Agricultural robots; Commerce; Efficiency; Employment; Forecasting; Industrial robots; Personnel; Population statistics; Public administration; Publishing; Robotics; Artificial intelligence technologies; Global labour markets; Government agencies; Higher efficiency; Industrial production; Social scientists; Statistical datas; Statistical Offices; Fintech",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097814243

The present study is an attempt to understand how an organisation's employees' creativity is affected by interplay of their psychological capital, creative self-efficacy and positive affect. In this line, we hypothesised that the effect of psychological capital on employees' creativity is parallelly and partially mediated by creative self-efficacy and positive affect. The outcome suggests a significant partial mediation by creative self-efficacy and positive affect.

Following Conway’s Law, the corresponding microservice development process (MDP) requires a distinct accountable team for each microservice to facilitate service autonomy. Although there are best practices for larger enterprises to take this organizational requirement into account, there is currently a lack of empirically founded understanding, how the adaptation of MSA in smaller organizations that have more constraint resources can be successful. Therefore, we have conducted an interview study comprising six cases of such small to medium-sized development organizations (SMDOs) in which we explore their applied MDP using the Grounded Theory methodology. Among others, we examined team composition, collaboration formats, technology, and central challenges. Our results show that in most of the studied cases, shifts of service ownership occur and most use a code-first approach neglecting documentation. Based on our observations, we assume that SMDOs in particular are threatened to contradict service independence.

The basis for any project-based resource estimation is a good production forecast. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate assisted production forecasting from the real-time data using AI (Artificial Intelligence) Techniques. Decline curve analysis is one of the most used production forecasting methodology. Conventional Production Forecasting involves anomaly removal and applying best method for DCA (decline curve analysis). These processes are combined and automated Using Big data and AI techniques, in this method. The algorithm used clustering techniques like isolation forest and density-based clustering to automatically remove the anomalies and later uses neural network / conventional curve fitting (depending upon data frequency) for production forecasting. It also used LSTM (Long Short-term memory cells algorithm) neural network to predict the flowing bottom-hole pressure with the rates forecasted using automated production forecasting. This in-turn was used along with VFP (Vertical Flow Performance) curves of the well to assess the well ceasure date under existing condition. The algorithm also has a module to recommend the decline rates of workover wells based on the similar past events by using unsupervised clustering techniques. The algorithm removed the anomalies data and perform production forecasting in a scalable manner. The actual and calculated EURs were matching very closely (very less root mean square error and a maximum deviation of 8%). This approach is useful to debottleneck the processes involved in production forecasting like identifying the rate changes, production forecasting and FBHP prediction. This information can be coupled with an interactive dashboard to support quick diagnostics, easy interpretations and prompt business decisions.

The aim of the initiatives is basically to improve the efficiency of critical processes thus at the end will reduce overall cost and improve production margin and revenue/profitability. This paper will present the initiative of PETRONAS' Pipeline fraternity consisting of pipeline experts, managers and engineers in the development of intelligent and integrated pipeline integrity management system. The system is designed to have minimal people intervention as data will be automatically uploaded by Inspection & Maintenance (I & M) vendors and field technicians through interface software and utilising artificial intelligence/ machine learning for descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. It is envisaged that by having the system, critical decision-making pertaining to integrity, safety and reliability of pipeline system could be done in ‘split seconds’ extending the asset's life and eliminating unwanted incidents i.e. leak/rupture. Furthermore, standardisation of pipeline risk and integrity software/tools among Operating PETRONAS Units (OPU)/regions will provide cost savings in the long term compared to current practice of having off-the-shelf software/tools. Integration of relevant corporate software/tools and the intended software/ tools will further provide cost savings in terms of database management and enhanced efficiency. There are few other initiatives running in parallel with the i-PIMS i.e. using advanced acoustic emission technology to detect corrosion anomalies using new developed sensors and also establishing algorithms/ analytics for corrosion's growth, location and position throughout pipeline length; formation of dynamic free spanning for offshore pipeline; and predicting/monitoring 3rd party impact occurrence. Development of pipeline predictive analytics is to gain significant improvement in PIMS for better integrity status verification, faster decision making and optimization for I&M activities. The overall outcome/results/algorithms will be integrated into i-PIMS as part of final assessment. It is PETRONAS' aspiration that eventually, descriptive analytic of i-PIMS i.e. critical pipeline integrity performance indicators and critical processes can eventually able to be accessed via mobile apps which will be a ‘pace-setter’ in overall pipeline integrity management scheme i.e. ‘effectively managing pipeline at fingertips’.

The model has ability to absorb configuration variations; it is run on periodic basis, to reassess the findings, and identify changes in the operating behavior of the asset.

The objective of this research paper is to establish fundamentally different thought process for maintenance decision-makers for dynamic-diagnosis of faults using normal operating data.

When linked through IIoT, the automated business decision for maintenance cost reduction can be applied on mass scale. The experimental results & field validations show that AI based diagnostics methodology outperforms traditional maintenance cost-management practices. It is a system which is self-learning, and therefore, as the model matures, dynamic strategy will evolve; and maintenance cost saving can extend beyond targeted 4% of net operating cost.

Industry 4.0 wave is based on cyber-physical production systems (CPS), aiming to connect the physical and digital production spaces. Under this framework, Industry 4.0 digital operations require the re-establishment of IT systems, in a way that human and machines are interconnected and interact in real-time, thus creating a more flexible, resourceefficient and optimal way of manufacturing. To this end, Industry 4.0 encompasses concepts that include Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in manufacturing, which promotes better smart production phases. Under the new digital framework of Industry 4.0, the role of proximity in advancing innovation partnerships and promoting efficient technology and knowledge transfer among the engaged partners, should be carefully examined. It becomes clear that stakeholders' coordination activities, which will ensure their efficient cooperation, continue to reflect issues of major importance and illustrate the value of proximity - in both physical and relative terms - in the newly defined innovation plane. One of the open theoretical challenges we attempt to tackle in the initial debate provided in our paper, concerns the possible functional transformation of proximity's spatial and non-spatial dimensions within this new digital Industry 4.0 framework, as well as the critical trade-offs that have to be made between the traditional (namely proximity) and the new technologybased approach (namely Industry 4.0) for the actors' effective coordination and cooperation. Towards this direction, we study the way proximity dimensions horizontally affect the new realm posed by Industry 4.0. Finally, given that the Industry 4.0 era of innovation cooperation gives rise to new issues, that is among others, cybersecurity and enhanced cognitive capabilities, we discuss the specific weight of each proximity dimension, and identify the need for certain dimensions to be developed amongst players compared to others that seem to rather diminish their significance. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The physical media are boxed, inventoried and stored in climate controlled salt mines and/or warehouses. Pertinent media with high priority datasets are recalled from storage, transcribed, and made available for processing, interpretation, data rooms, etc. The challenges associated with the physical storage construct of these assets include residual storage and shipping costs, pace of deterioration of legacy media, delayed access to requested dataset, valuable data locked away and inaccessible, amongst others. To combat these challenges, ExxonMobil initiated a strategic, upstream wide, digital transformation partnership with Katalyst Data Management whose mission is to increase opportunity generation by reducing the turnaround time of high priority datasets and providing access to previously undiscoverable data. The digital transformation partnership leveraged the latest tools, technologies, and techniques including enhanced metadata capture, live/automated QC, parsers and loaders, data analytics, automated metadata extraction, etc. In addition, petroleum data management standards and best practices were employed across the digitization value chain. The digitization of nearly 3 million hardcopy paper or mylar documents and more than 420,000 seismic tapes to date (as of July, 2020) has eliminated recurring physical storage costs, recovered valuable data from deteriorating media, shortened access to high priority datasets from weeks to hours, and provided access to previously undiscoverable ""dark"" data. Other digitization 'wins' include the elimination of the need for ExxonMobil to maintain facilities and hard drives to read physical media. This strategic partnership between ExxonMobil and Katalyst Data Management has led to the convergence of digital data from multiple physical data sources and data types, all on a single integrated subsurface domain agnostic platform.

The ultimate objective is to save lives, empower the vessel Captains to immediately identify and respond to violators, improve the HSE culture of the crew, and automatically generate live data analytics and statistics with the aim of improving safety in operations. The implemented AI use cases are; deviation for not wearing Protective Safety equipment in designated areas, violation of not utilizing safety passages, alert when no watchman in muster station, alarm when man overboard incident, alarm when man fell on stairs, and live Personnel on board each weather-deck. When introduced the Artificial Intelligence cameras, our marine vessels will adopt a smarter automated response and reporting culture, which will in turn, lead to increased safety oversight of our critical offshore operations. Therefore, with the advent of the AI technology, many common business processes have been automated thus enabling personnel to increase their focus on more important tasks while technologies like the AI System can handle many of the time consuming tasks. The solution components consists of Artificial Intelligence platform, high definition cameras, local server, wide-range WiFi access point, network infrastructure and a tablet. On the tablet device, the captain have full coverage of the vessel weather decks, working areas and restricted zones with a feature to generate alerts when detecting an emergency situation. This was provided to empower the vessel Captain to acknowledge and respond to violations as well as take a proactive action to prevent incidents from happening. The Machine Learning algorithm has been trained on actual scenarios and will be continuously improved by adding more recorded event to retrain the initial model. Currently, the prediction model is performing on the vessel operation mode and recording events with high rate of accuracy. In case of automatically detecting an alerting or non-compliance event, the captain would be notified, beacon lights and sound, and log recorded in the local and central system with a photo and a short video clip of the incident. The process of identifying HSE deviations are becoming digitally transformed by deploying AI capabilities on real-time video streams.

As energy companies continue to digitize existing assets and build new assets with intrinsic network connectivity, they present an ever-expanding attack surface to escalating attacks. Trends show that cyberattacks on OT targets have increased in frequency and sophistication. Meanwhile, structural mismatches in the life cycles and maintenance cycles present a challenging business case for companies seeking to defend assets, rendering current cybersecurity best practices both technically difficult and potentially unaffordable to sustain. Overall, the energy industry has made tremendous progress in maturing cybersecurity capabilities. Yet current practices leave significant gaps due to lag between updates. Put simply, systems patched on Monday are powerless on Friday to stop attacks methods developed on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. To meet this challenge and answer both the technical and the business case, future cybersecurity solutions need to meet clear requirements: They must function while isolated, remain potent between updates, provide flexibility for deployment in unique, widely varied OT configurations, and must meet or exceed the cost-benefit ratio of current practices. We believe that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions offer these characteristics, as well as ancillary benefits. This paper will describe in detail the current challenges faced by energy companies, the implications of observable industry trends, the characteristics that potential cybersecurity solutions must meet, and why we believe AI and ML technologies can meet these requirements now and in the future. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Cost benefit analysis; Gasoline; Life cycle; Security of data; Ancillary benefits; Cost benefit ratio; Current practices; Energy companies; Energy industry; Industry trends; Maintenance cycles; Network connectivity; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097544709

This implementation allows, through production rules defined in a knowledge extraction session, to make multiple comparisons with data taken from Cepsa's datalake, and to generate a series of recommendations. The objective of these recommendations is to facilitate Operator's work by warning of situations that may arise as an early warning system. An expert system is a program that imitates human behavior, optimizing the information provided to give an opinion on a specific topic. It has some specific knowledge about an area using information from human knowledge for decision making. Expert systems are the first operational result of artificial intelligence because they manage to solve problems through knowledge and reason in the same way that a human expert does. Cepsa has developed an Expert System platform where business unit specialists can generate their modules implement their rules and get results. This platform allows to scale as many modules as business units need. Many instances of Expert Systems rules have been implemented in some Cepsa units (Crude units, FCC, pumps, furnaces, vacuum unit …) with great acceptance by users and high revenues. Converting human knowledge to the knowledge of AI, expert systems operate as the assistant of expert people increasing supervisory effectiveness. Cepsa has been researching numerous options in the Expert Systems market, but we have chosen to develop our own platform for several reasons: Expert systems have been used mainly for other businesses. It allows giving recommendations on degrees of freedom in those units in which Machine Learning is not able to act due to there are no instrumented manipulated variables (manual valves…) These systems allow to optimize our plants by handling this type of variables.

Several initiatives were applied to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of drilling operations. One of the frequent difficulties that faces these operations is unexpected drilling troubles that take place and stops the operation, resulting in losing a lot of time and money, and could lead to safety issues culminating in a fatality situation. For that, the industry is in continues efforts to prevent drilling troubles. Part of these efforts is utilizing the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to identify troubles in advance and prevent them before maturing to a serious situation. Multiple approaches were tried; however, errors and significant deviation were observed when comparing the prediction results to the actual drilling data. This could be due to the improper design of the artificial intelligent technology or inappropriate data processing. Therefore, searching for dynamic and adequate artificial intelligent technology and encapsulated data processing model is very essential. This paper presents an effective data-mining methodology to determine the most efficient artificial intelligent technology and the applicable data processing techniques, to identify the early symptoms of drilling troubles in real-time. This methodology is CRISP-DM that stands for Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. This methodology consists of the following phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and Deployment. During these phases, multiple data-quality techniques were applied to improve the reliability of the real-time data. The developed model presented a significant improvement in identifying the drilling troubles in advance, compared to the current practice. Parameters such as hook-load and bit-depth, were studied. Actual data from several oil fields were used to develop and validate this smart model. This model provided the drilling engineers and operation crew with bigger window to mitigate the situation and resolve it, prevent the occurrence of several drilling troubles, result in big time and cost savings. In addition to the time and cost savings, CRISP-DM provided the artificial intelligent experts and the drilling domain experts with a framework to exchange knowledge and sharply increase the synergy between the two domains, which lead to a common and clear understanding, and long-term successful drilling and AI teams collaboration. The novelty of this paper is the introduction of data-mining CRIPS methodology for the first time in the prediction of drilling troubles. It enabled the development of a successful artificial intelligence model that outperformed other drilling troubles prediction practices.

With no control over the feed stock and finished material pricing, which are mostly governed by regulations, operators must look with in their Operation & Maintenance (O&M) for possible areas of optimization. In modern days, CIOs are greatly empowered to drive Digital Transformation strategy and contribute in improved profitability. Many of such initiatives fail to deliver the desired outcomes in timely manner. This paper discusses the essential elements of EDGE analytics embedding the fundamental aspects of plant O&M in such Digital Transformation initiatives, and thus enabling faster value realization of the investment. Methods, Procedures, Process: Every industry can be looked in to three different tiers as Assets, Process & systems and Business. Each of them has different outcomes to contribute in overall profitability. Moreover, technology, methodology, people and their collaborative adoption play a big role in achieving those outcomes. Asset performance is evaluated using KPIs like availability, reliability, cost & Safety. Process involves interaction of people & process fluids with those assets. However, the fundaments remain same as the source of information, based on which the O&M decisions are taken. Transducers & measurements around plant assets are the single biggest source of information for such decision making. Often, this information is not best utilized in terms of generating proactive insights. Information from these measurements can be converted into simple analytics. E.g. Proximity type vibration transducer measures vibration amplitude which is used for equipment safe operation and shutdown when exceed the defined threshold. Same transducer also provides the gap voltage and spectral data. Analytics definition using proximity probe gap voltage will identify rotor position within the bearing and then comparing it across the machine train along with orbit preload can give significant information about rotor dynamics. Such analytics available at EDGE are often overlooked in enterprise level predictive analytics deployed by Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning. One of the reasons for it is cyber security concern for the data exchange across IT-OT network layers. This paper talks about implementing comprehensive strategy utilizing the information from EDGE devices for EDGE analytics, various challenges and possible way forward in complying to cyber security requirements for data exchange from OT-IT systems and thus enhancing value of big data in Data Lakes. Results, Observations, Conclusions: EDGE analytics adds immense value for assets in achieving best of performance KPIs. With increased adoption of cyber security practices in plant operations, there are many IT approved architectures exist today to share these analytics insight to L4 - business network. With focus on industry domain experience around systems of systems and progressive thinking, EDGE analytics will play inevitable role in the overall success of O&G 4.0 in coming years. Novel/Additive Information: ""Data is the new oil"". Corporates in energy sectors are driving forth industrial revolution with this belief and investing heavily in big data-based projects. Asset condition monitoring systems at EDGE in OT domain remains in silos. High resolution static & dynamic data in various operating modes collected in these Condition monitoring systems hasn't been historically much interfaced with such big data projects. Use cases of such interfaces with static & dynamic data, benefits, related workflow, data exchange architecture is relatively newer in the industry. Comprehensive discussion of these aspects in this paper will enable industries to realize faster outcomes. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Big data; Condition monitoring; Decision making; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Gasoline; Investments; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Network layers; Network security; Predictive analytics; Profitability; System of systems; Transducers; Condition monitoring systems; Digital transformation; Essential elements; In-plant operations; Industrial revolutions; Systems of systems; Vibration amplitude; Vibration transducer; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097522142

As of May 2019, Crunchbase had collected records on 760,590 organizations (of which 708,558 companies), 121,509 investors of different types, 263,426 funding rounds, 890,429 people, 17,068 initial public offerings (IPO) and 89,959 acquisitions. The main purpose of this work is to give a detailed description of the Crunchbase database in order to highlight its potential and facilitate future researchers who intend to use this source of data. In order to achieve this goal, three main topics are covered. Since the database is provided in seventeen independent datasets, the linking logics have been reconstructed applying a reverse engineering approach. The relationships between the individual files have been identified and then summarized in an original diagram. For each dataset all the available variables are provided. Afterwards, in order to quantify the scope and coverage of the database, some key variables have been analysed, resulting in descriptive statistics for three areas of interest: Companies, funding rounds and investors. Specifically, analysis is provided about the geographical distribution of companies, the number of companies per year of foundation and current operating status, the number of companies by amount and number of investments raised and as well as the number of investors by number and amount of investments made. Finally, some indications on the potential uses of Crunchbase for research in entrepreneurship are given. Considering the characteristics of the available variables we focused on the applications of machine learning algorithms for the analysis and modeling of equity investment processes. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

This new process integrates both geoscience and engineering requirements to enhance non-metallic pipe deployments in the digital oil fields, using workflows for disparate data sets. It is based on interpreting large amounts of field data obtained from various engineering servers and geoscience data bases. A wide range of data-sets, such as various well stream variables and non-metallic technology operating conditions for hundreds of wells, and many different non-metallic pipe variations, are interpreted based on disparate workflows in the form of engineering decision trees. The outcome of the artificial intelligence process is to recommend the optimum non-metallic pipe technologies and generate an automated scope of work for optimal field results, and to predict the business-planning requirements for multiple fields at different operating conditions. Moreover, as part of this new process, well-stream data such as temperatures and pressures, H2S contents, gas oil ratios and produced gas conditions, as well as pipe size requirements and statistics are all deciphered for hundreds of wells in disparate workflows to determine the optimum non-metallic pipe technology required for any given set of field conditions, without the requirement of the human element. The preliminary workflows were stress tested successfully using representative wells with actual field data and the results are described in this paper. This new process was developed for several different types of non-metallic pipe technology, both rigid and flexible types, such as Reinforced Thermoplastic Pipe (RTP) both carbon-fiber and steel reinforced, Thermoplastic Composite Pipe (TCP), Reinforced Thermosetting Resin (RTR) and Internal Lining. The decision trees utilize the minimum and maximum allowable operating conditions for all the different technology types in different diameters, combinations and operating conditions against engineering parameters and statistics to forecast the optimum type and quantity of any non-metallic pipe technology for any given field, at any given time. The automation of this new process to electronically access existing big data servers to generate an automated scope of work and to supplement existing business-planning software significantly improves and optimizes the planning and implementation of non-metallic pipes. Furthermore, having an automated system significantly reduces the engineering time, while simultaneously reducing the error window, using artificial intelligence, allowing engineers to spend more time addressing other pressing challenges. The new process also results in cost savings by ensuring fit for purpose applications and ensuring optimal designs are applied. Finally, the developed workflows also serve as a guideline for the utilization of surface nonmetallic pipe technology for any field conditions. This serves as a valuable reference to add to both the industry and the existing body of literature. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Artificial intelligence; Automation; Big data; Data Analytics; Data streams; Decision trees; Forestry; Gasoline; Geology; Graphite fibers; Hydrogen sulfide; Metals; Oil fields; Predictive analytics; Reinforced plastics; Steel fibers; Strategic planning; Thermoplastics; Trees (mathematics); Automated systems; Different operating conditions; Digital oil field; Engineering decisions; Engineering parameters; Operating condition; Reinforced thermoplastic pipe; Thermoplastic composite; Pipe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097518416

This information is not represented explicitly in a process model but, nevertheless, it provides valuable contextual information. To this end, we propose a semi-automatic approach to discover a data model that complements traditional process mining techniques with domain specific information.

One such quest lies in giving AIs complex human capabilities - like leadership. We take the first step towards that goal and propose a pattern-based approach to leadership. We argue that leadership best practices are actually a series of mini interventions each of which results in a consistent and desired response from the followers. When codified, these repeatable interventions can serve as foundational blocks for AI algorithms. To this end, we introduce LeadLets: A pattern language that codifies named, scripted, and repeatable leadership techniques that have a predictable influence causing a purposeful effect on one or more individuals.

Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports. Furthermore, we provide a classification of smart airport sub-systems based on their purpose and criticality and address cyber threats that can affect the security of smart airport's networks. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Cyber security; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things (IoT); smart airport","Airport security; Airports; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Data mining; Network security; Real time systems; Business Process; Environmental conditions; Hardware constraints; Internet of thing (IOT); Misconfigurations; Real time monitoring; Security threats; Sensitive informations; Internet of things",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097341169

Existing oil spill detection methods including in-situ measurements and remote sensing primarily depend on involving skilled personnel in data collection, processing, and analysis, which could be expensive, slow, and subjective (influenced by prior experience, and judgment of problem parameters or solution space). In addition, oil pipelines and platforms can be located in remote and harsh areas, making it difficult and even hazardous for engineers to conduct timely inspections. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) can streamline this process and create more objective measures of oil spill and leakage detection. In this research, deep learning models, namely VGG-16 and mask R-CNN (mask region- based convolutional neural network) are employed to identify and locate oil spills. These models represent state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms in computer vision. Red-green-blue (RGB) training images are collected using semi-supervised learning (i.e., keyword search) from the web. This initial visual dataset consists of a diverse set of photos taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or first-person cameras from previous oil spill accidents. The methodology consists of model training and validation, image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The VGG16 model is used for image classification (to predict the existence of oil spill in an image) and yields an accuracy of ~93%. The mask R-CNN model is used for instance segmentation (to detect oil spills and marking their boundaries at pixel-level) and yields average precision and recall of 61% and 70%, respectively. Results can create opportunities for advancing the current practice of integrating AI and data analytics into downstream and upstream operations in the oil and gas industry, as well as enabling non-intrusive techniques for detection of environmental pollutants. © 2020, Avestia Publishing.

Coronavirus disease-2019 and the lessons learned must nudge corporations to think and act more holistically about sustainability and incorporate sustainability into the fabric of the organisation. Each Board Committee must do its part in ensuring the company adopts a robust framework around sustainability. Equally important to reporting on sustainability issues and measuring and managing sustainability risk, is measuring and analysing a company’s sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Key Board Committees all need to understand the impact global macro systemic risks can have on the company and the impact the company can have on externalities which can affect its sustainability ‘reputational footprint’. Boards need to ensure that every strategic decision is made through a sustainability lens. Not only will this enhance its societal impact but can be a key driver of performance. A strategic focus on sustainability at the Board level can be a source of competitive advantage. Boards need to measure and understand their sustainability ‘reputational footprint’ and benchmark themselves against their peers. Using big data and artificial intelligence, a corporate Board could integrate sustainability data into its business model and strategic decisions to give it a competitive advantage vs its peers. Boards need to have sufficient fluency in the latest sustainability technology to apply advanced statistical, data-driven information to optimise their sustainability ‘reputational footprint,’ which lowers their cost of capital and improves other financial metrics. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Big data; Board committees; Corporate boards; Governance; Strategic decisions; Sustainability risks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097233644

As a result of its popularity, it has been a focus of academic research since 2012. Industry 4.0 is the result of the convergence of different digital technologies in industrial productive systems. It refers to a digitised model of manufacturing, but there is no consensus on what exactly Industry 4.0 is, where its borders are, what organisational domains it comprises, or what technologies support this model. In practical terms, any company operating under an Industry 4.0 framework is subjected to intense technological change. Therefore, Industry 4.0 must be understood as a dynamic and evolving concept. From the academic perspective, it is necessary to clarify the term, understand the underlying factors and connect Industry 4.0 with other management research streams, such as digital transformation, open innovation or corporate venturing.

In this version we focus on matching IT and business processes from different management levels by using IT-Governance (ITG) Risk and Compliance frameworks in a smart way. In fact, every information system (IS) has two main interfaces with two key systems: Operating System (OS) and Decision System (DS). Every system has his own frameworks and best practices for efficient management. IT Governance is the ability to control IT strategy implementation by ensuring business and IT alignment for profitable digital services. Also, the variety of IT Governance frameworks for each hierarchical level in the enterprise, should be efficiently deployed together in order to have coherent recommendations for IS, OS and DS users. It is why we use COBIT 5 as a strategic IT Governance framework able to match and integrate other frameworks and best practices dealing with IT services, IT risks and compliance as well. We based the proposed IT GRC smart adviser on artificial intelligence and knowledge management as technical axes. This article presents, IT Governance frameworks, their matching problems and related works. Then it proposes a smart architecture with new functionalities to match COBIT processes with other frameworks in order to cover different management levels. The technical contribution of this article is to propose and implement an IT GRC smart adviser based on many frameworks and best practices to optimize and improve IT Strategies. The simulation was presented, the obtained results were compared to human experts' decisions and big similarities were observed. The aim of this article is to integrate knowledge from many IT GRC frameworks for better IT governance in a smart and easy way. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

The study design consists of a mixed-methods approach that applies a data-mining methodology and content analysis to the digital archives of eight scientific journals: six within the quality management (QM) domain and two with a focus on operations management (OM). The data set contains an unbroken time series of over 12,000 research paper abstracts, the first of them published in 1980, giving the study a coverage of almost 40 years. The findings show that sustainability came onto the scholarly scene in 1996 and has since become an increasingly popular research area. In regard to digitalisation, the story is quite different, as the concept is currently absent from the scholarly QM and OM literatures. However, a search for information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) revealed that these topics have been gaining attention since the 1980s. However, it was found that QM research only addresses one part of digitalisation, omitting several interesting dimensions. One example is that the QM and OM literatures address IS mainly in relation to standardised guidelines and business processes within organisations. At the same time, we found a handful of studies combining QM and topics related to modern digitisation, like social media. © 2020 The Author(s).

Advanced artificial intelligence methods, such as data mining and machine learning methods, penetrate data analysis. The application of these methods is most appropriate in the case of online sales of any goods in large quantities and various industries. They are very often used in the sale of electroni cs, PCs or clothes. However, it is also possible to apply them to the agricultural industry, not only in B2C, but also in B2B in the sale of seeds, agricultural products, or agricultural machinery. Appropriate combinations of offers and knowledge of customers can bring the selling entity higher profits or competitive advantages. The main goal of our study is to design a CRISP-DM process model that will enable small businesses to analyze online customers’ behavior.

Such processes are characterized by a high level of complexity, and additionally, by massive volumes of aggregated information. The current approach of production management is based on using a standard industrial methodology adopted for various enterprises. The industrial methodology contains algorithms and coefficients, accumulated from the statistic of the whole industry. The principal disadvantage of this approach is a strong contrariety between real production indicators and indicators described in the methodology. Enterprise management tasks must be solved using new automation and intellectualization approaches to analysis and forecasting of production indicators. Information systems of the enterprise contain all the necessary information to evaluate the state of production. The production processes can easily be represented by a discrete time series that could be extracted from information systems. It is necessary to use time series that modeling with type 2 fuzzy sets to account for the fuzziness of the real world.

From an evolutionary point of view, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is grounded and built on the previous revolution, and because it supports the digital technologies is often called, the Digital Revolution. It can be said that its objective assumed the fusion of technologies that bring the physical world closer to the biological and digital world. In the present paper, starting from a brief presentation of previous Industrial Revolutions, we analyze the challenges and opportunities of technological innovations, of technological progress represented by the artificial intelligence. Although the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to increase the revenue and to raise the living standard of humanity, a great challenge for new information technologies is the preservation of privacy life. Starting from such an aspect, we will try to present not only the benefits of this new revolution but also its possible disadvantages. For example, how the work and private life will be affected. An important attention is given by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to the field of energy, which involves clean and renewable energy. In this context, we will discuss the issues that outline the so-called Energy Revolution, that has begun at the planetary level and which involves a global energy production coming from zero-emission technologies as well as the integration of renewable energy sources into a smart overall network. © 2020 The Authors.

We are living an era of fast technological developments. Thus, we dare stating that the natural selection is not an option anymore, but rather the forced evolution and only those looking for new creative, innovative solutions will be able to survive, evolve and thrive in the future. We recently entered the 4th industrial revolution and we are about to take the next step to the 5th one. But we have to question ourselves: Are we truly ready to keep up with this alert pace of evolution? Are we prepared and aware of the opportunities and most important of the challenges brought by the new technological revolutions? Therefore, our paper aims to analyse/evaluate in a more or less comprehensive approach, the current state of play of the digital and innovative solutions (e.g.: Artificial intelligence) and their future impact on public administration's and business environment activities, educational systems and on the society, as a whole. Through our paper we also want to underline that we do not have any guarantees on how the scenarios will unfold, but nevertheless, we do have the prerequisites to foresee those scenarios and prepare ourselves to respond in a common, integrated manner, informing and involving all stakeholders - the public and private sector, academia and civil society.

These emerging technologies are driving the consideration of not only improvements in the development of their industrial use, but also further research into the ethical and legal issues. For example, robot acquisition of data in the form of 'life-logs' may lead to data confidentiality issues which we are not able to solve by focusing solely on AI data acquisition issues. A life-log is a comprehensive archive of personal, everyday life which is collected by computing technologies. This information is sometimes used for business purposes, such as online behavioural advertising. However, the meaning of the term life-log is vague. Similarly, the distinction between Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (non-PII) is not clear. In this paper, I detail and explain the current and complete range of legal accountability issues related to the collection of data for constructing a life-log. I propose a method for managing legal responsibility when life-logs are created and then used by others, whether they are individuals or organisations. Finally, I indicate the need to both clarify and streamline any future regulations related to life-logs. © WMSCI 2020 - 24th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings.

Predicting the power requirements according to the line and product conditions can significantly impact the energy cost and, thus, on the business’s profitability. This paper proposes predicting the power requirements of a tandem cold rolling mill of steel strips on a coil-to-coil base applying Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as a uni-variate regression problem. The tests yielded an MSE of 300.39 kW or 2.4% and are better than the acceptable 5% error margin for this project, indicating that the ANN presented satisfactory results. The application of six full-month worth of data in the trained ANN model showed the excellent correlation of the ANN predictions with the measured data, leading to the conclusion that the system is ready for the deployment for daily use for line engineers.

To address the change in paradigm, from mass production to mass customization, manufacturing flexibility is key. Moreover, current digitalization of the industry opens opportunities regarding real-time decision support systems allowing the companies to make strategic decisions, and gain competitive advantage and business value. The main contribution of this paper is a proof of concept Prescriptive System with a highly parameterizable simulation environment catered to meet the needs of Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems allied with an optimization module that takes into consideration productivity, market demand and equipment degradation. With this system, the effects of different throughput rates are monitored which results in better recommendations to mitigate production losses due to maintenance actions while taking into consideration the health status of the remaining assets. In the proposed solution the simulation module is modeled based on Directed Acyclic Graphs and the optimization module based on Genetic Algorithms. The results were evaluated against two metrics, variation of pieces referred as differential and availability of the system. Analysis of the results show that productivity in all testing scenarios improves. Also, in some instances, availability slightly increases which shows promising indicators.

The authors investigate these developments in a holistic manner and from a wide range of perspectives: both public and private, business and consumer, regulators and supervisors. Initially, they set the framework of their analysis by discussing innovation cycles in financial services. Thereafter, they tackle the issue of financial innovations and their consequences for financial stability. They then review the new approaches to financial consumers’ protection, which emerged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. The authors underline the fact that this new approach is heavily influenced by the recent innovative drive in the financial industry. Next, they switch their attention to the public sector, examining the innovative processes in monetary policy and central banks, structural innovations in the supervisory models and systems, and they assess some specific supervisory challenges regarding blockchain and the application of mathematics in the supervisory capacity. Additionally, the book examines a range of issues related to the private sector, such as recent developments regarding risk transferring mechanisms on the financial market, artificial intelligence and natural language processing for regulatory filings, the development of process management in insurance companies and other innovative products on the market. Finally, Innovation in Financial Services discusses how the digital transformation of the financial system impacts the interaction between the public and private sectors.

This exploratory and explanatory research has been performed in the context of digitization of Bangladesh economy. The research question is whether the transformation of Bangladesh towards the digital economy can act effectively and efficiently for the benefits of the society and the economy. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was conducted. Sixteen hypotheses were tested based on the Chi-square test. The time period of the study was from April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. The Chi-square test findings were significant for the following null hypotheses: Internet of Thinking will not bring benefits of the human beings; robots are not needed for industries; big data cannot be used for the business intelligence; artificial intelligence (AI) is not effective; bitcoin transactions should not be allowed; the banking sector is not relatively digitalized; chatbots do not need to be used in banks; drones cannot be used for commercial purpose; robots cannot be used for education purpose; farmers must not learn to yield wirelessly. Another six null hypotheses were rejected. Fear of losing employment was the key obstruction to execute the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in the country as revealed from the study. Proper information and communication technology (ICT) based education, preparation and knowledge were required. Good governance and regulation should be established with the help of digitization in Bangladesh.

The last decade has seen hundreds of cases of identity theft, loss of money and data breaches. It is estimated that by the year 2021, cybercrime losses may cost upwards of $6 million annually. Due to the constant risk of intrusions, the tech industry, businesses and government bodies must safeguard technology and data and this is where cybersecurity plays a major and critical role. It may be considered as the first line of defense against intrusions. The tools and techniques developed and supported by AI and machine learning (ML) are now expanding to cybersecurity to protect against cybercrime. There are many advantages in using AI-ML technology for cybersecurity but it is a double-edged sword. Just as AI cybersecurity technology may be used to more accurately identify and stop intrusions, the AI systems may be exploited for the commission of cybercrime. Cybersecurity is not an issue that a government can address on its own; it requires multi-stakeholders to work together in addressing the legal risk AI-ML technology presents to cybersecurity. The discussion is divided into two parts: Part 1 explores the beneficial use of AI cybersecurity technology; and Part 2 considers the harmful use of AI such as data breaches and the commission of cybercrimes. Cybersecurity and cybercrime are issues that cannot be separated from each other. AI-driven cybersecurity technology must keep pace with the legal risk that the use of AI in the commission of cybercrime poses otherwise it cannot effectively prevent, detect, respond to and recover from an intrusion. A preventative approach rather than a detection-focused approach should be applied to cybersecurity. The discussion identifies the legal risk that the use of AI for cybersecurity presents and how it may be addressed by means of ethics, policies and laws. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

This information can be effectively applied for Aspect Category Detection (ACD). Similarly, people’s emotions and recommendation-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered systems are in trend to assist vendors and other customers to improve their standards. These systems have applications in all sorts of business available on multiple platforms. However, the current conventional approaches fail in providing promising results. Thus, in this paper, we propose novel convolutional attention-based bidirectional modified LSTM by combining the techniques of the next word, next sequence, and pattern prediction with ACD. The proposed approach extracts significant features from public reviews to detect entity and attribute pair, which are treated as a sequence or pattern from a given opinion. Next, we trained our word vectors with the proposed model to strengthen the ACD process. Empirically, we compare the approach with the state-of-the-art ACD models that use SemEval-2015, SemEval-2016, and SentiHood datasets. Results show that the proposed approach effectively achieves 78.96% F1-Score on SemEval-2015, 79.10% F1-Score on SemEval-2016, and 79.03% F1-Score on SentiHood which is higher than the existing approaches. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Attention mechanism; CNN; Deep learning; IIoT; LSTM; Opinion mining; Social media analytic; Text classification; Word embedding (Word2Vec)","Long short-term memory; Conventional approach; Multiple platforms; Public review; Social media; Social media platforms; State of the art; Subject matters; Word vectors; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093981780

It begins with a presentation of the specific features of such systems in terms of functionality and potential risks. It was assumed that the features distinguishing medical systems from other information systems are: patient orientation, confidentiality of the information processed, state interference in the functioning of medical entities and the need to ensure maximum availability of system resources. The last requirement results from treating medical IT systems as elements of critical infrastructure, for which business continuity is one of the key features. The work focused on limiting the systems' sensitivity to cyber-attacks limiting their availability. A software and hardware platform dedicated for attack detection is presented. The system uses parallel processing and artificial intelligence and is distinguished by several alternative detection methods, the use of expert system to make decisions about protection measures and the ability to independently identify unknown attacks. Paper ends with an evaluation of prototype testing results and directing further work in this area.

This is done by introducing new technologies and processes. This is an opportunity for Polish participants of local heat markets, or participants of the power or energy market. who are currently facing profound changes and investments forced, among others, by BAT conclusions. Such mega-processes as digitization, automation, artificial intelligence, IoT, machine learning are increasingly penetrating the world and business. More than 200 years have passed since the first industrial revolution, which was the use of the steam engine, and the requirements for testing the efficiency of enterprises have changed, which themselves are changing very quickly. The basic efficiency measures used in a given sector often result from the specifics of the sector and its degree of development on a macroeconomic scale. Therefore, it is worth placing the energy company in this environment and presenting its role to better match the instruments used. The above is also associated with increased reporting and the need to use additional evaluation measures, e.g. effectiveness of individual projects. It is therefore worth analyzing the available literature in this area, and the performance measures available and used in it, which will help in assessing the effectiveness of management, despite political and regulatory turmoil, and help us use the opportunities brought by the fourth industrial revolution. © 2020.

In addition to using a feature store for reading pre-processed features, we also use it to interpret model explanations in a more user-friendly and business-relevant format. This enables both the end user as well as the data scientist personae to glean more information from the interpretations in a shorter time.

Businesses are seeing its value in a wide range of applications and therefore looking for ways to make AI an integral part of their decision-making processes. However, to trust an AI model prediction or to take downstream action based on a prediction outcome, one needs to understand the reasons for the prediction. With deep neural networks increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for models, generation of such reasons has become more challenging. Deep neural networks are highly nested non-linear models that learn patterns in the data through complex combinations of inputs. Their complex architecture makes it very difficult to decipher the exact reasons for their prediction. Due to this lack of transparency, businesses are not able to utilize this technology in many applications. To increase the adoption of deep learning models, explainability is critical in building trust in the solution and in guiding downstream actions in business applications. In this paper we aim to create human-interpretable explanations for predictions from deep learning models. We propose a hybrid of two prior approaches, integrating clustering of the network's hidden layer representation [2] with TREPAN decision tree [1], both of which uniquely deconstruct a neural network. Our aim is to visualize flow of information within the deep neural network using factors that make sense to humans, even if the underlying model uses more complex factors. This enables generation of human interpretable explanations (or, reasons codes) for each model outcome at an individual instance level. We demonstrate the new approach on credit card default prediction given by a deep feed forward neural network model. We compare and contrast this new integrated approach with three different approaches, based on the results we obtained from experimentation. © 2020 The Authors.","Clustering; Comprehensibility; Deep Learning; Explainable AI; Fidelity; LIME; Neural Network; Reason Code; TREPAN","Adaptive systems; Complex networks; Decision making; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Feedforward neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Business applications; Complex architectures; Complex factors; Decision making process; Integrated approach; Massive computing; Model prediction; Non-linear model; Deep learning",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093084118

The purpose of the article is to present the evolution of intelligent BPM systems (iBPMS) and dynamic case management/adaptive case management systems (DCMS/ACMS) and show that they converge into one class of systems, additionally absorbing new emerging technologies such as process mining, robotic process automation (RPA), or machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI). The content of research reports on iBPMS and DCMS systems by Gartner and Forrester consulting companies from the last 10 years was analysed. The nature of this study is descriptive and based solely on information from secondary data sources. It is an argumentative paper, and the study serves as the arguments that relate to the main research questions. The research results reveal that under business pressure, the evolution of both classes of systems (iBPMS and DCMS/ACMS) tends to cover the functionality of the same area of requirements by enabling the support of processes of different nature. This de facto means the creation of one class of systems, although for marketing reasons, some vendors will still offer separate products for some time to come. The article shows that the main driver of unified software system development is not the new possibilities offered by IT, but the requirements imposed on BPM by the increasingly stronger impact of knowledge management (KM) with regard to the way business processes are executed. Hence the anticipation of the further evolution of methodologies and BPM supporting systems towards integration with KM and elements of knowledge management systems (KMS). This article presents an original view on the features and development trends of software systems supporting BPM as a consequence of knowledge economy (KE) requirements in accordance with the concept of dynamic BPM. © 2020 Vilnius University.","ACM; BPM; DCM; dynamic BPM; iBPMS; systems unification","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Enterprise resource management; Knowledge based systems; Software design; Business process management; Business process management systems; Consulting companies; Emerging technologies; Knowledge management system; Process automation; Secondary data sources; Supporting systems; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092910703

Additionally, there has been substantial research undertaken on the role of attack in chess, which brought significant contributions to different fields of research. In this paper, the researcher investigates the attack concept in chess, as a strategic game by exploring virtual chess players of different strategies. In particular, the researcher explores the performance of an attacking grandmaster against three other class-A players of different chess personalities that vary in controlling the center of the chessboard. To this end, the researcher collected data from four virtual chess players: a grandmaster and three class-A players. The selected grandmaster is Josh Waitzkin who is known for his fearless attacking style and deep endgame understanding. The class-A players have different personalities: (1) a player who strongly controls the center of the board; (2) a player who ignores the center; and (3) a player who offers traps to control his opponent. The researcher measured different dependent variables including the errors of the players and the moves of the games. The findings show that class-A players of particular chess personalities perform differently. Additionally, the study reveals that there is a positive relationship between the findings and some of the existing real-life scenarios in the business domain. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attack; Chess; Chess personality; Grandmaster; Josh Waitzkin; Virtual humans","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Attack strategies; Business domain; Class A; Dependent variables; Growing bodies; Strategic game; User study; Virtual humans; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092904709

Therefore, effective remaining vehicle readiness and reduction in maintain costs have become an urging subject to be solved in the industry of today. However, as in the era of big data, it is important that the enterprise makes good use of data and information to save costs, increase revenue, and ensure competitive advantages. But if we could not ensure the quality of the data, it would easily lead the analysis to the wrong decisions. Therefore, this study is based on the predictive maintenance, taking the condition of data quality considerations, and using algorithms to construct a decision support model, and proposing optimal replacement cycles and rules for vehicle components, and analyzing the impact on brands and maintenance amounts. Therefore, this study is based on maintenance history, through systematic and manual analysis, to obtain good quality data, and then use chi-square test and algorithm analysis to establish a classification model for decision support.

After the data is cleaned and sorted, it obtains 173,693 work orders and good data quality data for 23 types of maintenance items. And the results show that: the costs contains significant divergence among brands; service parts damage is related to particular environment; we can obtain appropriate service period through proper classification rules.

It is more useful to understand the resource usage trends for each business process because generally multiple business processes run on an ICT system. For example, we can detect an increase in resource usage for a specific business process. However, conventional methods have not been able to analyze such trends because resource usage data is usually mixed and cannot be separated. Therefore, in the previous work, we proposed an analysis method that decomposes the data into components of each business process. The method successfully analyzed only single sources of data. However, an actual system consists of multiple resources and multiple devices. Therefore, in this paper, we enhance this method so that it is able to analyze multiple sources of data by incorporating a technique for unifying multiple sources of data into a single sources of data on the basis of a workload dependency model. In addition, the proposed method can also analyze the relationship between resources and application workloads. Therefore, it can identify specific applications that cause resource usage to increase. We evaluated the proposed method by using the data of on-premise and actual commercial systems, and we show that it can extract useful business trends. The method could extract system-wide processes, such as file-copy between two servers, and identify a business event corresponding to a resource usage increase. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business semantics; Capacity provisioning; IT operations management; Non-negative matrix factorization; Resource management","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Business perspective; Commercial systems; Component decomposition; Conventional methods; Dependency model; Information and Communication Technologies; Multiple devices; Multiple resources; Cloud computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092110098

Even though the digitization has been used for many years, people confuse it with digitalization. However, they have different meanings. Digitization means making a digital version of analogue or physical things. It uses computer systems to convert the non-digital thing to a digital format such as transferring a photograph into the digital environment. Digitalization means transforming or developing business processes and activities by leveraging digital technologies. It refers to the adoption of digital technologies in relevant activities and transforming business activities in a more digital way and method (I-Scoop, 2019). On the other hand, Gartner’s IT Glossary defines digitalization as the ‘process of moving to a digital business’. It stresses that digitalization is a way of changing business models and providing new revenues and value-added product models via using digital technologies (Gartner, 2019). Digitalization requires digital maturity, which is composed of strategy, culture, organization and leadership (Kane, Palmer, Phillips, Kiron, & Buckley, 2015). Transformation process driven by digital technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) has deeply affected the social, economic and political structure, and a new type of management, leadership and organizational culture are needed…. © Peter Lang GmbH.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091741246

This increasing trends results in the digitalization and networking of products and value chains that offer great potential to secure and expand the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. In addition to technical innovations, business model innovations as well as product or service innovations and the combination of both lead to unique selling points that are only made possible by new technologies. Against this background, digitization can be seen as a key driver of innovation. Within a very short time, start-ups have brought disruptive innovations into the market and turned entire industries upside down. While the manufacturing industry in particular has concentrated on the development of incremental innovations for a long time, the share of disruptive innovations is increasing continuously. This results in the need that companies have to modify the design of their innovation management to encourage disruptive innovations. On the one hand, it is important to make perfect use of day-to-day business; on the other hand, new subject areas must also be developed and explored in order to produce disruptive innovations. This two-handed approach to innovation management is also known as ambidexterity. In the course of this paper, the specific influences of digitization on the innovation management of companies in the manufacturing industry will be determined. On this basis, the particular challenges and their effects on the individual design fields of innovation management will be identified. As a result, we identified concrete design fields and belonging tasks that need to be modified from the perspective of increasing digitalization. Furthermore, we give first recommendations how the tasks of each design field could be adapted in order to encourage disruptive innovations. © 2017 The Authors.

This has increased the number of available mashups over the internet. The increase however, poses a new requirement of organizing and managing these mashups for better understanding and discovery. For this reason, tags have become highly important because they describe items and allows for easy discovery. Most existing tag recommendation methods typically follow a manual process based on controlled vocabulary, or consider tags as words in isolation contained in mashup descriptions. Such methods therefore fail to characterize the diverse functional features of mashups. This work proposes an attention model to automatically recommend mashup tags. Specifically, our proposed model has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the word- and sentence-levels and subsequently recommend top-N words with highest attention weights as tags. Our model is based on the intuition that not every word in a mashup description is equally relevant in identifying its functional aspects. Therefore, determining the relevant sections involves modeling the interactions of the words, not just their presence in isolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset crawled from www.programmableweb.com. We also compare our method with some baseline tag recommendation methods for verification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention mechanism; GRU; Mashup; Mashup development; Tag recommendation; Tags","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Attention mechanisms; Attention model; Business needs; Functional aspects; Functional features; Manual process; Sentence level; Tag recommendations; Web services",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091572931

Yet, group discussions, especially in a business context, are still challenging as non-verbal communication (NVC) is often depicted on digital whiteboards, including deictic gestures paired with visual artifacts. However, as NVC heavily relies on the visual perception, whichrepresents a large amount of detail, an adaptive approach is required that identifies the most relevant information for BVIP. Additionally, visual artifacts usually rely on spatial properties such as position, orientation, and dimensions to convey essential information such as hierarchy, cohesion, and importance that is often not accessible to the BVIP. In this paper, we investigate the requirements of BVIP during brainstorming sessions and, based on our findings, provide an accessible multimodal tool that uses non-verbal and spatial cues as an additional layer of information.

In this paper, we aim to grasp the essence of Dempster-Shafer theory by distinguishing between ambiguous-and-questionable and ambiguous-but-correct perceptions. Throughout the paper, we reflect our analysis in terms of signals and sensors as a natural field of application. We model ambiguous-and-questionable perceptions as a probability space with a quantity random variable and an additional perception random variable (Dempster model). We introduce a correctness property for perceptions. We use this property as an axiom for ambiguous-but-correct perceptions. In our axiomatization, Dempster’s lower and upper probabilities do not have to be postulated: they are consequences of the perception correctness property. Even more, we outline how Dempster’s lower and upper probabilities can be understood as best possible estimates of quantity probabilities. Finally, we define a natural knowledge fusion operator for perceptions and compare it with Dempster’s rule of combination. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Artificial intelligence; Bayesian inference; Dempster-Shafer theory; Dempster’s rule of combination; Knowledge fusion; Machine learning; Probabilistic reasoning; Sensor fusion; Uncertainty","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Expert systems; Intelligent databases; Random variables; Correctness properties; Dempster-Shafer theory; ITS applications; Knowledge fusion; Lower and upper probabilities; Natural fields; Probability spaces; Systems applications; Probabilistic logics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091514021

Firstly, brief summaries of the traceability theory and blockchain principle are given. Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is applied to reorganize the original supply chain workflow. Then a blockchain-based traceability framework is designed for the fresh food supply chain in the BPR project. We explore the basic architecture, product identification, data recording and storage of critical information in the fresh food supply chain. Finally, the architecture innovations and conclusions are summarized. BPR and blockchain are integrated in the supply chain traceability architecture, which provides a basic theoretical support for the further implementation of practical application and paves the way for the supply chain research of other foods. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain technology; Business Process Reengineering; Fresh food; Supply chain; Traceability architecture","Architecture; Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Digital storage; Food storage; Food supply; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Data tampering; Fresh food; Information asymmetry; Product identification; Traceability systems; Supply chains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091494664

To cope with this challenge from a HHC provider’s perspective, available resources must be deployed efficiently taking into account individual human needs and desires of employees as well as customers. On the one hand, corresponding strategic management questions arise, e.g., distribution or relocation of establishments or expansion of the vehicle fleet. On the other hand, logistical challenges such as the flexible and robust planning and scheduling of HHC service provision must be addressed by operational HHC management. This paper targets both perspectives by providing an integrated simulation-based framework for the evaluation of different business processes. Methods from Agent-based Simulation, Dynamic Microsimulation, and (Distributed) Artificial Intelligence are combined to investigate HHC service provision and to support practical decision-making. The presented approach aims to facilitate the reasonable development of the HHC provider’s organization to ensure the sustainable delivery of required medical care.

Over the last decade, there has been steady progress towards the automation of business processes under the umbrella of “robotic process automation” (RPA). However, we are currently at an inflection point in this evolution, as a new paradigm called “Intelligent Process Automation” (IPA) emerges, bringing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to bear in order to improve business process outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to provide a survey of this emerging theme and identify key open research challenges at the intersection of AI and business processes. We hope that this emerging theme will spark engaging conversations at the RPA Forum. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Intelligent Process Automation; Robotic Process Automation","Blockchain; Enterprise resource management; Process control; Robotics; Surveys; Artificial intelligence technologies; Business Process; Emerging trends; Inflection points; Intelligent process automation; Machine intelligence; Process automation; Research challenges; Intelligent robots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091338164

In such context, the existing RPA platforms that include AI-based solutions classify their components, i.e. constituting part of a robot that performs a set of actions, in a way that seems to obey market or business decisions instead of common-sense rules. To be more precise, components that present similar functionality are identified with different names and grouped in different ways depending on the platform that provides the components. Therefore, the analysis of different cognitive RPA platforms to check their suitability for facing a specific need is typically a time-consuming and error-prone task. To overcome this problem and to provide users with support in the development of an RPA project, this paper proposes a method for the systematic construction of a taxonomy of cognitive RPA components. Moreover, such a method is applied over components that solve selected real-world use cases from the industry obtaining promising results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; RPA; Taxonomy","Blockchain; Enterprise resource management; Process control; Robotics; Taxonomies; Business decisions; Cognitive automations; Common sense; Error prone tasks; Hand in hands; Process automation; Real-world; Intelligent robots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091335240

However, their use is usually limited to rigid and repetitive processes. Considering the inherent flexibility in most processes in the real-world and the increased need for managing knowledge-intensive processes, the adoption of declarative languages becomes more pertinent than ever. While the quality of imperative models has been extensively investigated in the literature, little is known about the dimensions affecting the quality of declarative models. This work takes an advanced stride to investigate the quality of declarative models. Following the theory of Personal Construct Psychology (PCT), our research introduces a novel method within the Business Process Management (BPM) field to explore quality in the eyes of expert modelers. The findings of this work summarize the dimensions defining the quality of declarative models. The outcome shows the potential of PCT as a basis to discover quality dimensions and advances our understanding of quality in declarative process models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Declarative process models; Model quality; Personal construct psychology; Process model understandability; Repertory Grid","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Business process management; Declarative Languages; Declarative models; Declarative process models; Inherent flexibility; Knowledge intensive process; Personal construct psychology; Repetitive process; Enterprise resource management",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091323507

However, the data mining technology is also a double-edged sword, in bringing convenience at the same time, will also cause the user’s privacy leak problem. In order to solve the problem, the symmetric searchable encryption technology is introduced into the association rule mining system to protect the privacy, and privacy preserving mining system of s (PP-MSAR) in OpenStack-based Cloud environment is designed. In order to solve the problem that the existing data mining algorithms can’t deal with large-scale data, this paper uses the computational power of Hadoop platform and add the global pruning technique to the existing algorithm based on MapReduce association rules, so that the counting of frequent item sets get reduced. At the same time, this paper add frequent matrix storage method into the distributed association rules algorithm and realize he algorithm of mining association rules for frequent matrix storage based on MapReduce. In addition, the introduction of symmetric searchable encryption technology to support the cloud server-side ciphertext retrieval, on the one hand to ensure that users stored in the database information will not be leaked to the outside for others, on the other hand also to ensure that the user data for the system staff confidential.

However, such challenges by their very nature are complex and require resources that are frequently beyond those that are traditionally accepted as relevant and crucial to a firm’s core business operations. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how firms identify and integrate diverse groups of actors using social intelligence to build an ecology of resources to tackle these complex challenges. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical part is based on qualitative single case study research of a packaging company and its waste management program. Findings: Organizing for sustainability requires business activities to be conceptualized as a continuous process of project building, involving actors in diverse settings and responsibilities divided thematically and spatially forming nets within a network to solve problems, collectively. There is a fundamental analytical problem of integrating a diversity of value spheres, and society has a set of rational methods for planning and action where decisions are made to privilege one aspect to the exclusion of others. Artificial separation of activities that are interdependent and failure to allow these activities to evolve through interactions in time and space could threaten sustainability. Research limitations/implications: This is a single case study within a certain context, therefore ways for orchestrating resource ecologies need further investigation. Practical implications: For managers, it is very important to recognize and appreciate the interconnectedness of resource ecologies but also that interactions resulting in joint actions can often have different rewards and benefits for the diverse range of actors implicated in such networks. This kind of social intelligence offers managers options to experiment with transitional pathways that match the objectives of diverse network actors and provide unique resource combinations for building competitive advantage. There is only so much that is under the control of managers or even firms, which means both must embrace uncertainty and the phenomenon of emergence. Social implications: From a societal perspective, the findings of the study show how the open and transparent activities for the sustainability of one firm spread through different layers of the society through connecting, sharing and developing resources. Therefore, it is important for societies to enable and support the open sharing of resources for sustainability. Investments in large programs for transitions to sustainability tend to spread from a focal company into various projects for sustainability involving several layers of actors within society. This ensures that awareness, behaviors and attitudes related with sustainability become rooted in society and give rise to valuable innovations. Originality/value: This study illustrates how resources are created and shaped through nets during transitions toward sustainability using social intelligence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecology; Networks; Resources; Social intelligence; Sustainability; Transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091311838

A key question in the context of process improvement is how response s to an event (action) result in desired or undesired outcomes (effects). From a process perspective, this requires understanding the action-response patterns that occur. Current discovery techniques do not allow organizations to gain such insights. In this paper we present a novel approach to tackle this problem. We propose and formalize a technique to discover action-response-effect patterns. In this technique we use well-established statistical tests to uncover potential dependency relations between each response and its effect s on the cases. The goal of this technique is to provide organizations with processes that are: (1) appropriately represented, and (2) effectively filtered to show meaningful relations.

Since logs contain potentially sensitive information about the individuals involved in the process, they should be pre-processed before being published to preserve the individuals’ privacy. However, existing techniques for such pre-processing are limited to a process’ control-flow and neglect contextual information, such as attribute values and durations. This thus precludes any form of process analysis that involves contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRIPEL, a framework for privacy-aware event log publishing. Compared to existing work, PRIPEL takes a fundamentally different angle and ensures privacy on the level of individual cases instead of the complete log.

The huge wealth hidden in the data, enterprises can obtain a lot of useful information from business management, market analysis, scientific exploration and other aspects to support the development decisions of enterprises. However, the actual data is often intricate with different structures and types such as erroneous data, invalid data and missing duplicate data, greatly increase the difficulty of data analysis. These dirty data can greatly affect the results of data analysis, resulting in inaccurate results or even bad information. Most of the early data cleaning requires human involvement, however the exploding large-scale data is far from being able to meet with the human intervention, requiring smarter and more automated cleaning methods. The rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, the emergence of machine learning, provides a new opportunity for the development of data cleaning. Nowadays, there are lots of methods that have been applied to the field of data mining, including popular machine learning, deep learning, as well as classical clustering, bayesian networks, decision trees, and so on. Both provide a large number of solutions for our data cleaning. In this paper, we present a data cleaning method which use adaptive parameters density cluster algorithms based on the DBSCAN. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Clustering; Data cleaning; Data mining","Bayesian networks; Big data; Cleaning; Data handling; Decision trees; Deep learning; Learning systems; Parameter estimation; Trees (mathematics); Adaptive parameters; Business management; Cleaning methods; Density clusters; Different structure; Human intervention; Information explosion; Scientific exploration; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091303046

The methodology for carrying out digital transformation must have the following characteristics: data-driven (real-time and historical data), all-inclusive (analysis provides input in multiple areas of product from design to supply chain), self-learning (predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, physics-based models), and human-machine interaction (user-specific visualizations and dashboards). This process allows for machines, systems, and users to be interconnected which allows for faster decision-making and lesser downtime.

However, in general, the accuracy of a predictive model is not optimal so that, in some cases, the predictions provided by the model are wrong. In addition, state-of-the-art techniques for predictive process monitoring do not give an explanation about what features induced the predictive model to provide wrong predictions, so that it is difficult to understand why the predictive model was mistaken. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to explain why a predictive model for outcome-oriented predictions provides wrong predictions, and eventually improve its accuracy. The approach leverages post-hoc explainers and different encodings for identifying the most common features that induce a predictor to make mistakes. By reducing the impact of those features, the accuracy of the predictive model is increased. The approach has been validated on both synthetic and real-life logs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Explainable artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Predictive process monitoring; Process mining","Enterprise resource management; Forecasting; Process control; Process monitoring; Business Process; Business process monitoring; Common features; Encodings; Life log; Predictive modeling; Predictive process; State-of-the-art techniques; Predictive analytics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091295469

We study the properties of the logic and provide automata-based mechanisms for deriving probabilistic inferences from its formulas.

The MobiMVL provides a full paradigm for mobile applications, including unified service model, business logic model and GUI model. These models formalize respectively the application’s component domain, business interactions, and graphical interface together with application behavior.

We particularly consider employee acceptance of intelligent robots with cognitive skills. During 48 interviews, hypothetical dilemmas regarding manual work, full- and semi-automation are discussed by office workers, managers and IT consultants. The results show that employees are positive about intelligent robots. The majority are willing to transfer repetitive tasks as long as humans can control outputs for accountability. However, employees prefer keeping tasks with creativity and human interaction. Many tasks can thus already be replaced by robotics, but more attention is needed for the facilitating role of organizations (e.g., training).

In Industry 4.0 practices, new ecosystems have evolved, where data and service provisioning often happens within dedicated platforms. Hereby, the challenge lies in ensuring the data sovereignty of enterprises in terms of self-determination with regard to the use of their data. While conceptual modeling of these platforms inhabits a large number of opportunities, for instance, including automated generation of access policies, research in this area is scarce. To this end, we propose a bottom-up approach using the iStar 2.0 modeling language. In this paper, we first introduce a model describing the market participants of a data and service exchange platform in the realm of smart farming. We then generalize and provide a formalization of relevant aspects in a broader context. The resulting models serve both as a basis for discussion on the requirements analysis level and as fundamental groundwork for further value generation in the area of data sovereignty in complex cross-organizational settings.

Three trends are especially important in shaping the impact of domestic policies on the Digital Silk Road. First, recent industrial policies have increasingly focused on technologies centered around artificial intelligence, 5G telecommunications, and smart networks. Second, while policies are still state-led, they rely on close partnerships with private firms such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. Third, a new wave of regional policies aims to create urban clusters that will be more efficient and less congested than regions dominated by single large cities. Each of these trends can be witnessed in the activities of Alibaba in Malaysia. Already a pioneer of smart city development in China, Alibaba has begun implementing its City Brain program in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, complementary to its e-commerce and logistics initiatives in Southeast Asia. While Malaysia is a front runner in these activities, similar dynamics are at work throughout the region. There are powerful complementarities created by dynamic private Chinese businesses, the large Chinese market, and the availability of finance for China-supported infrastructure programs. policy implications • The U.S. and other nations committed to open standards need to recognize that a few Chinese companies, like Alibaba, have already made substantial inroads into Southeast Asia and are purveying an attractive business model. • The U.S. and Japan need to improve the quality of their game in Southeast Asia. It cannot be presumed that a backlash will develop against Chinese government-dominated initiatives or corruption. On the contrary, attractive, concrete, low-cost alternatives must be offered to the countries, businesses, and people of Southeast Asia. • The ultimate shape of smart infrastructure is not yet known, and the potential for heightened transparency and more responsive systems is large. Many countries, and specifically those in Southeast Asia, have an interest in open systems that increase their options and do not tie them to a single business partner. The U.S. needs to develop a comprehensive program to strengthen the open global system and provide these countries with secure access to it. © The National Bureau of Asian Research, Seattle, Washington. © 2020 National Bureau of Asian Research.","Artificial intelligence; Industrial policy; Malaysia; Smart cities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091207771

Such concepts are not always well understood and their results in terms of production performance may not be clear. This work proposes a comparison between a traditional manufacturing process and an advanced manufacturing process, both modelled by a multiagent society. In the traditional manufacturing simulation, the agents follow the defined times of each process, including the maintenance times. In the advanced manufacturing simulation, the decision about when to stop a piece of equipment for maintenance is defined by the agent according to data received from sensors and the definitions of the process. The results indicate a significant improvement in equipment usage and consequently higher production in the same time interval. The process simulation clearly indicates that the application of advanced manufacturing concepts in industry is relevant in order to increase the efficiency of production processes. Among the main concepts introduced in advanced manufacturing models are the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The models generated are computationally simulated using an agent-based simulation method from the software AnyLogic.

The COVID-19 is the seventh member in the coronavirus family, different from its predecessors MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The world has been facing an outbreak generated by the coronavirus and has no specific therapeutics or vaccines. In the absence of vaccines, governments across the continents have been implementing “Social Distancing” to the extent of curfew as a traditional public health measure. Due to the strict implementation of the social distancing, the businesses have converted their default operational mode as work from home. Meanwhile, the healthcare fraternity is working day and night to discover a breakthrough in the anti-coronavirus drug; it is essential to run the economic activities in parallel to save the world from the rescission. The global businesses are now identifying state-of-the-art ways to keep their business operations as usual. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most organizations’ primary focus was profit and wealth maximization rather than business continuity. Post disruptions, now organizations are adopting business continuity best practices. Adoptation of analytics, business intelligence and artificial intelligence solution is a part of such measures, which ultimately help businesses to track and optimize. This research paper discusses the factors contributing to an organization’s business continuity plan, including the adoption of Analytics and BI solutions. It also analyses the increased popularity of BI solution after coronavirus outbreaks. At the core, the big data, analytics, and BI solutions are also helping to track the virus and scrutinize public healthcare infrastructure availability. It enables the quick identification of the infected people, their travel history, and empowering administrative decision-makers to implement the best viable practice. © 2020, Ashwin Anokha Publications and Distributors.

The proposed architecture was based on a framework to build chatbots, but it was necessary to replace and adapt services to attend EV.G needs. The architecture is composed of the following modules: Interface for direct interaction; Artificial Intelligence to comprehend and process messages; Development to deal with the knowledge base; and Business Intelligence to analyze messages. The first version responded to questions related to Institutional Membership and chitchat. Still, it was noted that Eva needed more training data considering that the developers could not predict well user behavior. Therefore, it was necessary to change the conversational data examples and flows to match user behavior observed after release, which showed an increase in the chatbot's response confidence.

In this respect, recommender systems have been proven to be the solution for enterprises, especially for cultural small and medium-sized organizations and enterprises (SMOs/SMEs), to enhance the discoverability of their products. This study aims at presenting a concept-centric literature review of recommender systems for cultural SMEs/SMOs to identify the current status-quo of the application in six cultural domains, including heritage and libraries, live performance, visual and applied arts, written and published works, audio-visual and interactive media, and sound recording. The finding of this paper reveals the adoption of recommender systems of cultural SMOs/SMEs is still in the early stage of maturity. The specific status-quo of recommender system adoption in each cultural domain is uncovered through the literature review. Other relevant aspects, which relate to data sources, data mining models, and algorithms, are also discussed in detail. Finally, the paper proposes future research directions to promote the application of artificial intelligence in general, and recommender systems, in particular, in the cultural sector.

In particular, the present research focuses on two sources of newly created knowledge, i.e., operational excellence and Industry 4.0, to understand whether they should be implemented sequentially or simultaneously. Operational excellence refers to the implementation of practices such as just in time, total quality management, and Six Sigma that help a firm to create knowledge that facilitates waste reduction and customer value improvement. Industry 4.0 refers to the implementation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, robotics, Internet of Things, and laser cutting that help a firm to create knowledge to improve overall business performance. We identified and analyzed 30 papers published in 13 peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in the field of operations management. Our findings based on the systematic literature review suggest that the interplay between operational excellence and Industry 4.0 can be categorized into four groups: (1) Industry 4.0 supports operational excellence; (2) operational excellence supports Industry 4.0; (3) complementary; and (4) no interdependence. Majority of the papers under study are in the first category, suggesting Industry 4.0 technologies as enabler of operational excellence. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090753389

While the ways in which legal professionals process and share information have evolved with new technologies — primarily with the emergence of personal computers, email and the internet — these technologies have not fundamentally transformed it. However, if media reports are to be believed, advances in technology in general — and the field known as ""Artificial Intelligence"" (AI) in particular — are on lawyers' doorsteps, and the legal industry is on the cusp of radical change. Fuelled by big data, increased computing power and more effective algorithms, AI has the potential to fundamentally transform the way in which legal work is done, the way in which law firms conduct business, and the way in which lawyers deal with clients. A number of technologies that fall under the AI umbrella, such as machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and others, have already brought about the automation of many tasks that were, until recently, performed exclusively by humans because they required human intelligence. AI systems can also be used to perform many tasks that lawyers routinely perform, such as contract analysis, case prediction and e-discovery. And, according to proponents, these emerging technologies can do it cheaper, faster and more efficiently. This contribution examines the notion that recent advances in technology will ""disrupt"" the legal profession. It first describes the astonishing advances in technological progress, especially the recent rise of AI. It then considers the technologies and areas of legal practice most susceptible to this disruption. It concludes by envisaging what AI might mean for the legal profession, and how current technological trends might, in a relatively short period of time, transform the way in which legal services are delivered. © 2020, North-West Unversity.

In academic research, machine learning has been used to make predictions of fraud, bankruptcy, material misstatements, and accounting estimates. More importantly, machine learning is generating awareness about the inductive reasoning methodology, which has long been undervalued in the mainstream of academic research in accounting and auditing. The use of machine learning in accounting/auditing research and practice is also raising concerns about its potential bias and ethical implications.

In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: Legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses. © 2020 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

However, the Internet of Things (IoT) has superseded many new technologies. IoT basically consists of algorithms that obtain your retail habits more than what can be probably assumed. IoT capabilities allow devices and sensors to communicate with other devices to achieve faster work and reduce overall sales time. One good example of IoT is artificial intelligence (AI) which has the highest effectiveness on the retail businesses. These machinery tactics lead to smarter cities that make everything easier to deal with. From Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) smart tags to the IoT sensors that can tell whether a product is about to be purchased, or if it is being returned to the shelf using scanning codes. Furthermore, they have the ability to scan faces with ease, allowing it to mark down whether employees are absent or present. Out of stock items are easily identified through the use of IoT.

The world is becoming increasingly data driven and technologically disrupted, and this momentum is expected to continue. According to the World Economic Forum (Kirk Bresniker 2018), ""every two years we create more data than we've created in all of history. Our ambitions are growing faster than our computers can improve."" Our industry's success will depend on timely development and appropriate application of machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and other advanced analytics. However, these tools may be ineffective and even destructive if the data used is compromised. In our study, we identified the factors that contribute to the problem of compromised data. Technical data and business landscapes are highly complex, segmented and largely disjointed. Most organizations are fragmented, working in silos rather than collaboratively. Production data owners in the field are traditionally far removed from data users at the office. Often ""raw"" data owners in the field have limited appreciation of the importance of ""trusted data,"" while data users at the office spend 80% of their time looking for and cleansing data, and only 20% of their time transforming data into actionable insights to drive informed decisions (Gabernet and Limburn 2017). The disconnect between departments often results in significant ""hard-dollar"" loss, which contributes to unknown potential value loss. Our data governance framework (Fig. 1) is a nine-step, methodical procedure that helps address these problems and positions the company to be more agile moving forward. 1. Determine organizational priorities and define the scope 2. Invest in organizational change management - key for adoption and sustainability 3. Establish the data governance organization, demonstrating comprehensive leadership support 4. Connect and align teams through a fit-for-purpose data catalog 5. Establish data governance policies to support priorities 6. Define new operating model by transforming policies into new ways of working 7. Design enabling technologies to support the data governance objectives 8. Implement ongoing data quality and availability monitoring 9. Facilitate sustainability via periodic audits based on pre-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) We developed and applied this systematic procedure to create trusted data in a world-leading natural resources company. Quality production data clearly enabled better informed and more strategic decisions and helped protect the company against potential litigations. Specific benefits were quantified to the following annual recurring economic value (in the context of sub-USD 60/bbl oil price environment) for 1,700 wells in the U.S. shale: • Improved information and decision quality (USD 3.7 million) • Reduced cost and cycle time (USD 4.4 million) • Increased production (USD 3.2 million) Trusted production data converted into robust, actionable insights improved performance in the following functions: • Well performance • Predictive maintenance • Operational intervention • Revenue and joint venture accounting • Regulatory reporting • Reservoir analysis In this paper we detail our tested and effective nine-step data governance framework, developed based on years of experience in the oil and gas industry, ranging from operations, engineering, and production volumes allocations to information technology and continuous improvement. Key to the importance of this work is treating data as a strategic asset and recognizing that, without trustworthy data, planning and performance analysis, whether performed by human colleague or robotics/advanced analytics, is of limited and misleading value.

Contrarily to such an attitude, the approach we took in this paper is that people will experience rather positive effects of work automation, thanks to collaboration with artificial intelligence using virtual assistants. The quantitative experimental study was a business problem simulation. Participants were asked to perform tasks of a marketing manager in order to prepare a marketing campaign for a new product. Control group participants performed these tasks on their own, while experimental group participants did them in collaboration with a virtual chatbot-like assistant created specifically for this simulation. A total of 20 people participated in the study. A relevant difference in performance was observed between the groups, n = 20, t(18) = 5.25, p &lt; 0.001. Participants collaborating with a virtual assistant achieved a 57% higher productivity (measured by tasks done) than those working on their own. Furthermore, in a post-study survery they assessed their productivity higher and were more satisfied with their performance. Results confirmed the hypothesis, proving that human-AI collaboration increased productivity within the studied sample. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090375418

Many businesses pay higher attention to “engagement marketing” that maximizes social actions, as social actions can effectively promote brand awareness. This paper studies social action prediction for in-feed advertising. Most existing works overlook the social influence as a user’s action may be affected by her friends’ actions. This paper introduces an end-to-end approach that leverages social influence for action prediction, and focuses on addressing the high sparsity challenge for in-feed ads. We propose to learn influence structure that models who tends to be influenced. We extract a subgraph with the near neighbors a user interacts with, and learn topological features of the subgraph by developing structure-aware graph encoding methods. We also introduce graph attention networks to learn influence dynamics that models how a user is influenced by neighbors’ actions. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets from the commercial advertising platform of WeChat and a public dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that social influence learned by our approach can significantly boost performance of social action prediction.

Many commercial sites rely on the reviews to evaluate their product and services. Other sites are especially designed for the users and reviews to e valuate any product or service. However, select the best review is still a big challenge for the user to select. Many works have been proposed to select the best reviews but with contain redundant information. The best personalized review that is really related to the main topic that the user is searching on is very important. For this reason, in this work, a new personalized reviews’ selection is proposed. We based on the idea of that different point of view for the user causes different evaluation and revering. For this reason, searching on the best reviews in a specific subject gives more accurate and significant selection results.

This makes it a valuable resource not only for energy production but also for a lot of other valuable products that could be derived from it. The harvesting and processing of this feedstock into value-added products currently require a lot of energy and water as well as utilization of various types of chemical cocktails. With the increasing global demand for sustainable production and consumption, the future outlook in the lignocellulose biomass conversion to value-added products would be in sustainable production of energy crops, re-examination of logistic handling of lignocellulose biomass for sustainability, and development/utilization of alternative chemicals for its conversion to value-added products. In general, the future would focus on redesign of biomass conversion technologies for sustainability as well as progressive development of circular business models in the biomass industry. The future of the biomass industry will also see deployment of artificial intelligence than what is seen now. Some of the challenges to this transition, especially in the developing countries, would be the availability of enabling infrastructure and the requisite/sustained sociopolitical goodwill to push through the required changes. Sustainability education for the future generations of engineers and policy makers would be crucial in overcoming the challenges. Sustained public education would also be necessary to communicate the pros and cons of the changes to the public. This chapter would provide details on the current state of lignocellulose biomass conversion to value-added products from sustainability standpoint. It will also expound on the identified future outlooks and challenges as well as give some more insights on the solution pathways to addressing the challenges. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass; Environmental impacts; Lifecycle cost; Social sustainability; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable production","Artificial intelligence; Bioconversion; Cellulose; Crops; Developing countries; Feedstocks; Lignin; Sustainable development; Biomass conversion; Biomass conversion technologies; Energy productions; Future generations; Renewable resource; Sustainability education; Sustainable production; Value added products; Biomass",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090036348

It aims to suggest a way to “set the ball rolling” by designing the paths of education for lawyers anew, with civil society in mind, and not just thinking of the requirements of legal training. Lawyers with knowledge in the field of information technology, interdisciplinary lawyers for business, lawyers-guardians of the rule of law and justice all need study programmes to take their predispositions, goals, skills, and abilities – all at different levels – into account. The purpose of the article is to shed light on the extra-legal barriers hindering the taking of a practical step ahead. The author shows three main ways of educating lawyers and explains why they are so important and why they call for changes in study programmes. Next, the author points to the obstacles faced by reformers and suggests exploring their actual impact on education in law and the level thereof. © 2020 Author.","Artificial intelligence; Educating lawyers; Homo zappiens; Illusory superiority; Interdisciplinary lawyer in business; Lawyer-defender of justice; Narcissism; ‘bullshitting’",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089778738

The ongoing digital transformation can enable servitization towards more advanced services with a more customer centric view. Macro economically, the industrial sector is very important for most of the developed countries. The digital transformation is posing a triple challenge to the machining and equipment manufacturers and will require a continued development of the existing business models, a change of organizational structures and a strong leadership to remain successful. The companies will need to re-evaluate their market justification and define their value proposition to both existing and potentially new customers. New skills are required as data and analytics, represented by IIoT and AI, will play an ever-larger role in the companies' interaction with their present and new customers. For the industrial companies, servitization is both linked to higher risk and to a higher earnings potential. Implications for Central European audience: The implications for Central European industrial companies of the ongoing digitalisation and servitization will be profound. The European car industry is undergoing significant changes and not only due to E-mobility. Also Products-as-Service will have an impact on their whole value chain.

More recently it also includes disciplines that were “reserved” to humans such as art and design. While there is a strong debate going on if creativity is profoundly human, we want to investigate if creativity can be supported or fostered by AI—not replaced. This paper investigates if AI is capable of (a) inspiring designers by suggesting unexpected design variations, (b) learning the designer’s taste or (c) being a co-creation partner. To do so we adopted AI algorithms, which can be trained by a small sample set of shapes of a given object, to propose novel shapes. The evaluation of our proposed methods revealed that it can be used by trained designers as well as non-designers to support the design process in different phases and that it could lead to novel designs not intended/foreseen by designers. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","Artificial neural network; Design process; Genetic algorithm; Human-machine co-design; Inspirational AI","Agricultural robots; Deep learning; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; AI algorithms; Art and designs; Co-designing; Design process; Design variations; Latest development; Novel design; Small samples; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089315043

KPIs depend on the end-to-end connection between the server and the end-user device. Not only Telco operators must provide the quality needed for the different applications, but also they must address economic sustainability objectives for VHC networks. Today, both goals are often not met, mainly due to the push to increase the access networks bit-rate without considering the end-to-end applications KPIs. This paper's main contribution deals with the definition of a VHC network deployment framework able to address performance and cost issues. We show that three are the interventions on which it is necessary to focus: i ) the reduction of bit-rate through video compression, ii) the reduction of packet loss rate through artificial intelligence algorithms for access lines stabilization, and iii) the reduction of latency (i.e., the round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing and content delivery platforms, including transparent caching. The concerted and properly phased action of these three measures can allow a Telco to get out of the Ultra Broad Band access network 'trap' as defined in the paper. We propose to work on the end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth utilization ratio (i.e., the ratio between the throughput and the bit-rate that any application can use). It leads to better performance experienced by the end-user, enables new business models and revenue streams, and provides a sustainable cost for the Telco operators. To make such a perspective more precise, the case of MoVAR (Mobile Virtual and Augmented Reality), one of the most challenging future services, is finally described. © 2013 IEEE.","edge-cloud computing; quality of experience; Telecommunications policy; very high capacity networks; virtual and augmented reality","Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Benchmarking; Flow control; Image compression; Mobile telecommunication systems; User experience; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Band-width utilization; Economic sustainability; End-to-end application; End-to-end connections; Key performance indicators; Quality of experience (QoE); Virtual and augmented reality; Quality of service",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089309571

It develops a theoretical framework to evaluate its impact on employee engagement, retention and productivity levels, stemming from its potential implications for service quality and customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the exploration of relevant literature, role theory and service-profit chain were used to develop – role-service-profit chain. Findings: Role-service-profit chain is an analytical tool which has strong implications for investment and deployment analysis of the new technologies in hospitality and tourism businesses. It proposes how managers can evaluate how the role expectation of technological innovations relate to service quality and customer satisfaction through its impact on employee-related outcomes (such as employee engagement, retention and productivity), and assess the corresponding impact on profitability and growth, in the context of their own unique internal environment and position in the market. Research limitations/implications: Although an empirical assessment of the hypothesised relationships in the model is required to evaluate and validate it in the hospitality industry, role-service-profit chain presents promising implications for tourism and hospitality practice and future research. Practical implications: Role-service-profit chain is an analytical tool from which managers can make improvements on talent and talent management practices and adjust expectations and behaviours in ways that facilitate improvements in service quality and customer satisfaction. Originality/value: This paper makes an important contribution to hospitality and tourism literature, as it explores how AI technologies implemented to improve on talent and talent management practices impact on service quality and customer satisfaction, and develops analytical tools by which this may be evaluated. © 2020, Huub Ruel and Esther Njoku.","AI and robotics; Customer satisfaction; e-HRM; Hospitality industry; Role theory; Service quality; Service-Profit chain",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089259574

In fact, though this is an era of digitalization and artificial intelligence, the establishment of an entire smart city platform still requires high costs, especially in poor and developing countries where technological developments are still almost absent. Taking this issue into consideration, this study was carried out to suggest a new approach allowing shipping companies to keep working with their ITS even outside of the context of Smart city. This is possible through implementing a transport information system that is based on Genetic algorithm, Big Data, and multi agent architecture. The information system will provide and exchange data about the optimum path to follow with vehicles (travelling vehicle problem) on the road.

However, most companies fail due to poor integration of technology in their supply chain. The concept of Procurement 4.0 has emerged to optimize supply chain performance developing new value propositions and meeting new business needs. It is the integration of Industry 4.0 concepts in procurement. Although Industry 4.0 concepts have been studied in different industrial contexts, a limited number of researches have been conducted on the use of emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Big data and Cognitive analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies, etc. in relation procurement while more existing researchers have focused web-based applications which facilitates real-time communication across supply chains. Therefore, the applicability of industry 4.0 technologies in procurement should be investigated. In this research, a literature survey involving systematic identification and review of 45 articles published in different sources between 2000 and 2019 was carried out to identify different emerging technologies that can be used across the procurement process.

We base this concept and call on a literature review linking technological automation, the future of work and emotions. Our review finds that: (1) many existing studies – whether predicting dystopian end-of-work mass unemployment, or utopian complementarities between humans, machines and digital platforms – are technologically determinist in nature, and do not account for the roles of culture, society, government, business and education in the machine–human–emotion interface; (2) despite this, there is evidence that technology will replace many existing forms of human labour, leaving only technologically irreplaceable emotion-based soft-skill service work (and emotional labour) for humans to perform; (3) there is an outside chance (in some literature) that technology and AIs will replace even emotional labour, though we argue this is unlikely for many years; (4) the increasing centrality of emotional industries, emotional data and emotional labour to work, digital platforms and media-imagery will likely lead to emotions becoming vital commodities, central to the economies of the future. The article concludes with an urgent call for a new research agenda on emotional economies to elaborate on private/ public intersections between work, economy and emotions that soberly engage with the future while challenging technologically determinist assumptions that underpin populist depictions of the end of work. © Bristol University Press 2020.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Automation; Emotion; Emotion management; Emotional labour; Future of work; Gig work; Technological change; Work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088840426

Given such a distributed nature, Multiagent Organizations (MAO) are a promising paradigm for conceptualizing and implementing business processes. Yet, MAO still lack of a systematic method for reporting to the right agents feedback about success or failure of a task. We claim that an explicit representation of accountability and responsibility assumptions provides the right abstractions to engineer MAO for supporting the execution of business processes. Basing our programming approach on MAO, we present two accountability patterns for developing accountable agents. To illustrate this approach we use the JaCaMo multi-agent programming platform. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Business goals; Business Process; Engineering business; Explicit representation; Multi-agent organizations; Multi-agent programming; Systematic method; Multi agent systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088753349

This research wants to shed light on the progress in industrial AI applications and, most importantly, the respective design and development process. Assuming that a lack of human-centered-design is a key source for considerable pains of the users, e.g. to trust in the system, and problems for stakeholders involved, e.g. exaggerated expectations [1, 2]. The paper outlines a) a B2B-factory planning case study, including setup and implementation, b) the validation of the process and its results through interviews, and c) the pitfalls and challenges of designing AI algorithms in the given context. Of particular importance are 14 themes that have been developed from analysis of a qualitative study with the development team, users and stakeholders involved. Some of the themes are relevant to other use cases and domains as well, some are use case specific and some derive from the focus of the design perspective. Those insights serve as a basis for further steps of investigation and, ultimately, foster a (cross-disciplinary) transfer of knowledge towards other domains. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Factory automation; Machine learning; UX","Design; Factory automation; Human computer interaction; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Artificial intelligence technologies; Business to business; Cross-disciplinary; Design and development process; Development teams; Human-centered designs; Qualitative study; Transfer of knowledge; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088751256

And then, a Balanced Scorecard application has been performed to translate the SME network strategy to operational level ICT initiatives. Finally based on the guidance received from the literature and the established ICT initiatives, a set of ICT tools were created for the business model.

BlueJourney was designed to connect customers, IBM researchers and other technical areas by using Design Thinking techniques. We have a specific space of immersion and co-creation and a team of professionals specialized in software development, business, engagement, design, ecosystem, education, marketing and content production. BlueJourney was created on 2018 to attend our clients’ transformation needs. We study their challenges, and with clients’ specialists, researchers and technical areas from IBM, we explore deeply their problems and opportunities to innovate. Therefore, we create viable solutions that truly meet people’s needs and expectations. In 2019, some clients brought the challenge to develop projects by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Sometimes because they knew exactly how AI could help their business and sometimes just because it’s a buzz word, it’s a movement that they don’t want to stay out. In all the cases, we run the BlueJourney program to find out viable solutions with AI. But as AI is already a theme of solution with technology, we had problems to seek a perfect way to do it. Design Thinking is a method to study problems and opportunities and to create solutions. So, it’s an assumption not starting with a predetermined technology. For these cases, when we need to discuss how to apply AI as a solution for some problems, we already have the technology determined. Also, for most of AI solution we need to have the data available to build the solution, that is not always the true in client reality. For these reasons, we decided to create a way to work with Design Thinking methodology when we have the premise to work with AI. In this paper, we will present a study about Design Thinking for AI. We will show how we simulated a challenge and developed the steps this method suggested, and all the conclusion about this process. We will also propose an approach about Design Thinking and AI based in the study. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Design Thinking; Innovation; User centered design","Design; Human computer interaction; Software design; User experience; Co-creation; Content production; Design thinking; Viable solutions; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088748986

In Africa and other resource-constrained environments, there is a clear knowledge void with regards to unique challenges faced when attempting to design and implement contemporary e-Government. The chapter is anchored on descriptive informetrics as a philosophical orientation. This orientation enables it to employ a detailed bibliographic analysis of work published in scholarly and policy outlets. This enables it to ground the discussion using both formulaic and conceptual definitions of key concepts explored. This chapter is as a result of continuous research in e-Government that has been going on for the past decade. This research intended to explore the emerging dimensions of e-Government in the realm of 4IR. The chapter discusses the emerging model of public service delivery given the growing enshrinement of 4IR in public service delivery platforms.

In the present day, there are large volumes of advertisement campaigns designed for, and running on Social Media Platforms, yielding significant conversion rates for businesses. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have offered new techniques for tailoring advertisements towards targeted audiences. Some of these techniques include Machine Learning (ML) applications in the analysis of Big Data; acquired from customers spending, and/or buying patterns. Hence, software companies and researchers have created several tools that target specific customers in need of specific products and services. An aspect of AI that has not seen too many applications in Advertising is Natural Language Generation (NLG); the study of algorithms for generating natural or human languages. In this chapter, we present a NLG algorithm for the automatic generation of advertisements for Social Media platforms. This algorithm is implemented in a tool called Sell-Bot that is based on Context-free Grammars; a formal technique for describing or generating languages. This algorithm takes a list of available and currently discounted commercial products and services of an organisation, and intelligently composes a valid Social Media post (a tweet or Facebook post) that is often indistinguishable from a human expert marketer’s tweet or post. An evaluation of Sell-Bot showed that 42% of the participants did not know whether the AI (Sell-Bot) or the human generated the adverts. Sell-Bot is expected to relieve humans of their efforts of posting advertisements on Social Media. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advert synthesis; Advertising; Context-free grammar; Natural language generation; Procedural generation; Social media; Synthesis of things","Artificial intelligence; Context free grammars; Context free languages; Natural language processing systems; Sales; Automatic Generation; Commercial products; Conversion rates; Formal techniques; Intelligent tools; Natural language generation; Products and services; Social media platforms; Social networking (online)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088457225

The process includes not only the purposeful addition of additives but also the contamination occurring in growing stage, storage and when distributed. Adulteration has become a big business. We belong to a land where our ancestors taught that “food is medicine”. Milk is one of the important foods consumed irrespective of age that ranges from infants till old people. On the contrast, in recent business era, milk is getting adulterated in more complicated ways that bypass the normal tests and hence there is a huge demand for a cutting-edge technology for detecting the same. Application of Artificial Intelligence has emerged in many diverse fields not limiting to identification of food adulteration. This paper gives a gist of most important and significant researches that are carried on in the detection of adulterated food, particularly milk using the techniques of machine learning.

The system utilizes Google Maps and its ""multiple destination"" function to search for possible routes. The routes undergo a multilayer perceptron model for traffic condition simulation. Finally, the system applies Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the optimal route. The proposed system bears the following features: (1) a multilayer perceptron model is created using the history of traffic conditions; (2) the route planning considers traffic condition prediction based on the expected time of travel; (3) the optimal route is calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm based on vehicle speed; (4) the system can include multiple destinations in its calculation, providing comprehensive travel plan for the logistics vehicle; (5) the system allows logistics business operators to keep track of their vehicles' whereabouts and current traveling route. The system was implemented during experiments and proven to be feasible as well as effective in reducing idle driving and enhancing transportation efficiency. It is verified that the suggested system in this study has shown an outstanding performance from the experimental results; hence, the suggested system is capable of applying in realistic industry conditions. © 2020 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

This profusion of technology brings with it the promise of various benefits including increasing efficiency and lowering costs for not only insurers and intermediaries, but also businesses or consumers as end-users of insurance. However, the development of InsurTech comes with corresponding risks and regulatory concerns not currently accounted for by the traditional regulatory model.

PBPM systems support process workers and process managers in making operational decisions. State-of-the-art PBPM systems apply deep-learning techniques with multiple hidden layers to infer from data which makes it difficult for system users to understand why a prediction was made. However, the user needs to see deeper causes to identify intervention mechanisms that secure process performance. The main contribution of this paper is a technique that makes a prediction more explainable by visualising how much the different activities included in a process impacted the prediction. This work is the first to use gated graph neural networks (GGNNs) to make decisions more explainable, and it’s also GGNN’s first application to PBPM.

Its importance is reflected in the impact of material quantities on forming the prices of individual positions, hence on forming the total cost of construction. The construction companies use the estimate of material quantity, among other things, as a base to make a bid on the market. The precision of the offer, taking into account the overall conditions of the business realization, directly influences the profit that the company can make on a specific project. In the early stages of project implementation, there are not enough available data, especially when it comes to the data needed to estimate material consumption, and therefore, the accuracy of material consumption estimation in the early stages of project realization is smaller. The paper presents the research on the use of artificial intelligence for the estimation of concrete and reinforcement consumption and the selection of optimal models for estimation. The estimation model was developed by using artificial neural networks. The best artificial neural network model showed high accuracy in material consumption estimation expressed as the mean absolute percentage error, 8.56% for concrete consumption estimate and 17.31% for reinforcement consumption estimate. © 2020 Željka Beljkaš et al.",,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087213760

However, it remains unclear how and to what extent machine learning will affect radiology businesses. Conducting a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we compile the opportunities and challenges of machine learning along the radiology value chain to discuss their implications for the radiology business. Machine learning can improve diagnostic quality by reducing human errors, accurately analysing large amounts of data, quantifying reports, and integrating data. Hence, it strengthens radiology businesses seeking product or service leadership. Machine learning fosters efficiency by automating accompanying activities such as generating study protocols or reports, avoiding duplicate work due to low image quality, and supporting radiologists. These efficiency improvements advance the operational excellence strategy. By providing personnel and proactive medical solutions beyond the radiology silo, machine learning supports a customer intimacy strategy. However, the opportunities face challenges that are technical (i.e., lack of data, weak labelling, and generalisation), legal (i.e., regulatory approval and privacy laws), and persuasive (i.e., radiologists' resistance and patients' distrust).

In this regard, energy efficiency hands out challenging aspects, for both home and business usages. Scalability in energy management systems is particularly difficult in those industry sector where power consumption of branches located in remote areas need to be monitored. Being autonomous requires that behavioural rules are automatically extracted from consumption data and applied to the system. Best practices for the specific energy configuration should be devised to achieve optimal energy efficiency. Best practices should also be revised and applied without human intervention against topology changes. In this paper, the Internet of Things paradigm and machine learning techniques are exploited to (1) define a novel system architecture for centralised energy efficiency in distributed sub-networks of electric appliances, (2) extract behavioural rules, identify best practices and detect device types.

In short, how is it being used to derive intelligence or rather Business Intelligence. Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are among the top technology interests in current era. Different industries utilize BI and Data Warehouse (DW) in different forms and are on different maturity levels of the utilization. Healthcare industry being one of the most data intensive domain, demands a unique way of data handling. Maturity level of DW in healthcare domain is lower than other industries, like manufacturing or e-commerce. Self BI enables the end user to drill down and roll up through the data to arrive at desired conclusion without the intervention of any technical support. In this paper, authors are trying to develop a dimensional data model for healthcare revenue cycle, which will in turn facilitate Self BI. An effort is made to combine the clinical and financial dimensions together to arrive in a holistic view. A phased approach which consisting of four stages is utilized in the study and the resulting model is modular in nature to join and accommodate the various other data marts, representing other areas of healthcare. © 2020, Research Trend.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming prevalent in software products. The use of AI entices consumer inquisitiveness, promising software products that can make our lives easier, productive, and in some mission-critical applications safer. Similar reasoning can be applied to systems exploring Internet of Things, cloud services, and mobile technologies. However, there is a trust deficit when it comes to accepting AI as well as the other above-mentioned features, as a reliable technology platform. This paper argues that the more critical the domain is, the less consumers seem to trust software to make decisions on their behalf or even to be used. Aspects such as safety, privacy, and ethics challenges the perception of trustworthy computing. In the past two decades, several works have suggested that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) may play an essential role in creating a trust paradigm between customers and businesses promoting loyalty, customer retention and thus enhancing customer trust and increasing corporate profit. We believe that the software industry will need soon rather than later to encourage trust in their embedded software. A promising approach lies in adapting principles associated with CSR to guide the software development processes. Such an approach could help to achieve two goals: Deliver trustworthy software and, if desired, deliver socially responsible software. We believe that Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) will play a crucial role in this endeavor. This paper highlights a first approach to establishing a basic set of NFRs that should always be carefully considered when developing software, as to aim socially responsible software. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Ethics; Non-Functional Requirements; Socially responsible software; Transparency; Trust","Application programs; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Sales; Social aspects; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Trusted computing; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Customer retention; Mission critical applications; Nonfunctional requirements; Software development process; Software industry; Technology platforms; Trustworthy softwares; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086309994

Accurate demand forecasting of such products is crucial as it plays an important role in driving efficient business operations and achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Traditional forecasting methods are inappropriate for this type of products due to the highly uncertain and volatile demand and the lack of historical sales data. It is therefore critical to develop different forecasting methods to analyse the demand trend of these products. This paper proposes a new data mining approach based on the incremental k-means clustering algorithm and the RULES-6 rule induction classifier for forecasting the demand of short life cycle products. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using real data from one of the leading Egyptian companies in IT ecommerce and retail business, and results show that it has the capability to accurately forecast demand trends of new products with no historical sales data. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2020.","Clustering; Data mining; Demand forecasting; Rule induction; Short life cycle products","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Data mining; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Sales; Business operation; Demand forecasting; Forecasting methods; Product diversity; Retail business; Rule induction; Short life cycle products; Sustainable competitive advantages; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086273233

The difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution; this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund generated by monthly contributions. The complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward. This paper presents the Random Neural Network in recurrent configuration that makes predictions on time series data, specifically, prices. The biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections makes predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs.

An analysis of interviews with 15 experts from different industries related to Marketing and AI shows that AI have impact in Marketing processes and the impact will be bigger in the future. The study reinforces that many of the manual and repetitive tasks of a marketer’s life can already be replaced by AI, and the use of machines working together with humans are the key to better marketing results. The challenges and ethical aspects that lead to a slow or non-adoption of AI have been addressed, and one of the major obstacles is that humans aren’t yet confident in technology and, they are not yet ready for this cultural change.

In this regard, the usage of suitable tools will contribute to making effective business decisions. The described framework of the business intelligence system aims to support such decisions in an effective way. The core of the proposed decision support system relies on several modules with a different database. One of them contains the input data of the particular problem, second include multi-criteria design analysis models, while the next contains optimization models to support decision-making. These optimization models are the focus of the current article. Two single and one multi-objective optimization models are formulated to express different situations and to support business decisions via reasonable solutions. Depending on the particular purpose, one of the models can be used to determine the best or compromise decision, which contributes to the effectiveness in business management. The applicability of the proposed models and respectively the core of the framework of business decision-making in efficiency management is illustrated in public street lights renovation. The obtained results show that all models are practically applicable in the determination of corresponding decisions in accordance with the selected goal. As the essences of the proposed framework are the optimization models this proves the effectiveness of optimization models in decision making to support efficient management. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business intelligence; Decision support framework; MCDA; MCDM; Optimization models","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Information analysis; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Multiobjective optimization; Business decisions; Business intelligence systems; Business management; Efficiency managements; Efficient managements; Multi-criteria designs; Multi-objective optimization models; Optimization models; Decision making",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086137902

Despite the push by business and government to develop AI, there is a concern about the real effects it is having on society. This study was designed to explore student perceptions of AI through quantitative statistical methods. The results of this study suggest that the general perception of AI is positive, but there exists some concern about the rapid development of AI and how it will affect humankind. In particular, being more informed about AI developments has a significant influence on both positive and negative perceptions of its impact on individuals and society. Furthermore, this paradox, along with the lack of understanding about AI, seems to add to a social tension arising from the inevitable advance of technology and the uncertainty of the effect of AI. © 2020 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.

This has resulted in an enhancement in the quality of life and optimized use of various resources. IoT uses various technologies related to networking, sensing, databases and artificial intelligence to enhance the lifestyle and makes business processes simpler. In the IoT based systems, the number of devices contributing to a particular application is very large, spreading to a large geographical area at various locations. The device can be considered as a resource used by a service in the application layer. IoT service is the most important entity. The real-world things generate data by perceiving the environment in large quantity and store it in the distributed databases or cloud databases. This manuscript analytically and statistically categorizes and analyze the current research techniques on the service discovery and selection in the IoT, published between 2010 and 2018. It finds that the discovery among a huge number of services requires fast, scalable and dynamic service discovery mechanism over the Internet. Once the services are discovered, the next step is to select the most appropriate service. This paper includes a comprehensive analysis of the discovery and selection of services in IoT.

Such changes include the rise of the millennial consumer cohort, and the introduction of retailers implementing enhanced artificial intelligence (AI) data methodology to analyse business, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to enhance experience and co-customization interfaces. Two seminal pieces of literature regarding consumer experience are Ballantine and Parson’s analysis of consumer experience factors and Pine and Gilmore’s (1999) Experience Economy. However, these studies were conducted nearly a decade ago, leaving a void in the literature that does not consider more current factors impacting consumer experience. The purpose of the present research was to: analyse popular press coverage to understand trends in experiential elements; and to extend the Ballantine and Parsons’ framework by proposing more current experiential elements. The researchers used the EBSCO database to generate a list of articles written from 2008 to 2018; these articles were then analysed via a qualitative content analysis method, using Ballantine and Parson’s and Pine and Gilmore’s frameworks as a base. Emergent themes that did not fit the above frameworks were added, thereby updating and extending the current body of knowledge. Findings indicated an increased emphasis on ‘experiential retailing’ over the years 2016–18. Product display, employees, colour and comfort features emerged as the most important Ballantine and Parsons themes, while new emergent themes of technology, uniqueness/personalization and entertainment/escapism/discovery were added to the Ballantine and Parsons framework, thus updating it to reflect current retailing trends.

Nevertheless, since the mid-1990s, the inability of DSS to fully satisfy a wide range of information needs of practitioners provided an impetus for a new breed of DSS called business intelligence systems (BIS). This paper examines the major differences among decision support systems (DSS), business intelligence (BI), and data analytics (DA). These three systems are different in terms of data, analytical environment, analytical tools, their focuses, and others. Next, the paper briefly describes the major characteristics of each. Third, A survey of DSS, BI, and DA is conducted covering the period of January 2016 through December 2019 to report publication trends of each system. The final section summarizes the findings and discusses their implications. This research provided a picture of what has happened over the past several years.

Emerging technologies such as robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial intelligence (AI), and cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) capable of facilitating real-time processes, visibility and transparency of factory operations will speed up the change of manufacturing paradigms. The mass customization and personification is expected to increase further.The capability to address the requirements and needs of each individual customer will be a key differentiation and competitive factor. At the same time the workforce in Europe is diminishing, causing a miss-match between skills and needs from the industry. In manufacturing industry any skills are developed by experience, reflecting time on the labour market and age and skills taught in qualifications change. Qualifications which are prone to technological change are likely to reflect quite different embodied skills according to age cohort. In order to answer these challenges we have established a robotics fablab concept to support both formal and non-formal education offered to the younger students and industrial workforce alike. The concept utilises digital learning contents, a fablab operating philosophy and mobile factory concept, meaning that parts (e.g. robot cells) of the laboratory can be shipped to another location for a while to be used by learners. This paper will described the concept and preliminary findings from the applicability of the concept. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on years of archival research and first-hand experience of major news agencies, this book provides a comprehensive history of the leading news agencies based in the UK, France and the USA, from the early 1800s to the present day. It retraces their relations with one another, with competitors and clients, and the types of news, information and data they collected, edited and transmitted, via a variety of means, from carrier-pigeons to artificial intelligence. It examines the sometimes colourful biographies of agency newsmen, and the rise and fall of news agencies as markets and methods shifted, concluding by looking to the future of the organisations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

During this phase, an important set of activities are carried out to manage requirements elicitation, verification, prioritization and validation. Dimension and dynamics of software development are changing with the passage of time. Economic growth in different sectors is increasing the demand for software development. This enhancement has introduced the concept of Value Base Software (VBS) development. Requirements prioritization is playing a vital role in ordering requirements to support the release planning of the software. A prioritization process is considered as highly complex process and depends on the nature and size of requirements. VBS systems are entirely different from typical software development, and prioritization process for VBS is also very challenging. A need arises from the provision of prioritization techniques to support the technical and business aspects-based prioritization. Existing techniques are not qualified to meet the expectation of the industry for VBS development. Therefore, this research contribution is an effort made, based on an intelligent decision support system for requirements prioritization in the domain of VBS system. Aspects based requirements prioritization is applied to many requirements and results are produced in two clusters.

Object-Orientation (OO) is one example - which extensively requires analytical capabilities. For testing the OO-related capabilities a questionnaire (OO SET) for prospective and 1st year students was developed based on the Blackjack scenario. Our main target of the OO SET is to identify clusters of students which are likely to fail in the OO-related modules without a substantial amount of training. For the interpretation of the data the Kohonen Feature Map (KFM) is used which is nowadays very popular for data mining and exploratory data analysis. However, like all sub-symbolic approaches the KFM lacks to interpret and explain its results. Therefore, we plan to add - based on existing algorithms - a “postprocessing” component which generates propositional rules for the clusters and helps to improve quality management in the admission and teaching process. With such an approach we synergistically integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence by building a bridge between machine learning and knowledge engineering.

Nowadays, IoT cannot be reduced to smart homes as due to the recent technological advances, this concept has evolved from small to large-scale environments. There was also a need to adopt IoT in several business sectors, such as manufacturing, logistics or transportation in order to converge information technologies and technological operations. Due to this convergence, it was possible to arrive at a new IoT paradigm, called the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). However, in IIoT, it is also necessary to analyze and interact with a real system through a virtual production, which refers to the use of Augmented Reality (AR) as a method to achieve this interaction. AR is the overlay of digital content in the real world, and even play an important role in the life cycle of a product, from its design to its support, thus allowing greater flexibility. The adoption of interconnected systems and the use of IoT have motivated the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because much of the data coming from several sources is unstructured.

Alongside these developments are the increasing cyber security risks and vulnerabilities, inevitably entailing mitigations. Web application vulnerabilities are security holes, which attackers may attempt to exploit, hence potentially causing serious damage to business, such as stealing sensitive data and compromising business resources. Since web applications are now widely used, critical business environments such as internet banking, communication of sensitive data and online shopping, require robust protective measures against a wide range of vulnerabilities. This work explores remediation methods – HTTP header verification, tokenisation and challenge-response authentication of vulnerabilities against login CSRF attacks. Experiments comprising of nine test cases with the three mitigation methods and three vulnerabilities are conducted to identify whether exploitation of vulnerabilities was able to bypass a mitigation method and how the mitigation behaved in web applications of virtual environments. Using techniques and specific scripts of simulated web applications, three mitigation methods are mapped to the exploitation of the three vulnerabilities in different settings in search of an optimal solution. Results indicate that the HTTP header verification was not successful in protecting users from clickjacking exploitation, while it was successful in protecting against XSS and CSRF attacks. Further, exploitation of the three vulnerabilities bypassed the tokenisation mitigation and XSS attacks were prevented by challenge-response authentication, although exploitation of clickjacking and CSRF defeated the mitigation. The significance of these results lies in the fact that different methods are effective or ineffective in different conditions and therefore no single solution can be considered as most appropriate for web applications. The study concludes that best practices can be sought through empirical and experimental studies, via which observation and analysis of behaviours of different solutions under different scenarios of attacks are conducted. Such experiments, designed to bypass mitigations, provide insights into robust and appropriate implementation approaches and, in the era of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, they should be routinely and automatically conducted. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Challenge-response authentication; Clickjacking; Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF); Cross-Site Scripting (XSS); HTTP header verification; Login CSRF; Tokenisation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085182977

The aim of the study is to guide the software development organization (SDO) for Cloud-based testing (CBT) adoption. To achieve the aim, this study first explores the determinants and predictors of Cloud adoption for software testing. Grounded on the collected data, this study designs a technology acceptance model using fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (FMCDM) approach. For the stated model development, this study identifies a list of predictors (main criteria) and factors (subcriteria) using systematic literature review (SLR). In the results of SLR, this study identifies seventy subcriteria also known as influential factors (IFs) from a sample of 136 papers. To provide a concise understanding of the facts, this study classifies the identified factors into ten predictors. To verify the SLR results and to rank the factors and predictors, an empirical survey was conducted with ninety-five experts from twenty different countries. The application value in the industrial field and academic achievement of the present study is the development of a general framework incorporating fuzzy set theory for improving MCDM models. The model can be applied to predict organizational Cloud adoption possibility taking various IFs and predictors as assessment criteria. The developed model can be divided into two main parts, ranking and rating. To measure the success or failure contribution of the individual IFs towards successful CBT adoption, the ranking part of the model will be used, while for a complete organizational assessment in order to identify the weak area for possible improvements, the assessment part of the model will be used. Collectively, it can be used as a decision support system to gauge SDO readiness towards successful CBT. © 2020 Sikandar Ali et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Fuzzy set theory; Software design; Academic achievements; Fuzzy multi criteria decision making (FMCDM); Fuzzy multi-criteria decision makings; Organizational assessment; Organizational efficiency; Software development organizations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technology acceptance model; Software testing",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084971608

The broadband Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing require to analyze the data from streams to make data-driven decisions in real time. In today's world of more complex and increasing in the number of network attacks, one of their most important data is the data from network security (NS) tools, ensuring their secure and resilient operations and uninterrupted provision of services to its users. At Gartner Data & Analytics Summit-2019 augmented analytics and data management, as well as continuous intelligence and explainable artificial intelligence were indicated among the top trends in data and analytics technology that have significant disruptive potential over the next 3-5 years. In practice, complexities of the modern attack scenarios often make it difficult for NS administrators to understand the current NS-related status and to recognize emerging patterns of attacks in a vast amount of raw data before they make a substantial impact. To benefit from the NS-related stream data, businesses require powerful analytics tools for ingesting and processing it. There are four consequent levels of analytics maturity-namely descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive. In this paper, a simplified NS-related stream data architecture, suitable for predicting attacks against network assets and services provided is proposed.

The world image, including in the industrial world, has been changed by the concept of intelligent enterprise (IE) - a set of technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent automation (IA), deep learning technologies, predictive analytics and cognitive computing. The increasing complexity of the oil and gas business and the decreasing optimization potential from traditional approaches require the use of new, innovative digital technologies to remain competitive. Responding to the market conditions of falling hydrocarbon prices, the oil and gas industry is increasingly mastering Big Data to optimize technological processes and prevent accidents. The emergence of Big Data technologies, predictive analysis and machine learning are changing the general image of many industries, and the oil and gas industry is no exception. New players are quickly emerging throughout the industry, and digitalization will affect the entire value chain throughout in the oil and gas industry. Among the most promising segments for the transition to digital technologies are asset management and infrastructure facilities, field development, geophysical services, pipelines and processing. Digital technology is the most powerful driver for cost reduction. It is expected that implementing these solutions will, by 2030, reduce the costs of E & P projects by up to 30%. Thus, Russia can leverage these new technologies and retain a share in the world energy market for another 50 years. The oil industry has recently passed the most difficult period in the last 30 years. The fall in oil prices since 2014, the reduction of 350 thousand employees worldwide, and fall in production investment are examples of serious challenges that the industry has faced in recent years. These challenges have resulted in new attempts to optimize business through implementing new technologies to improve the efficiency and profitability of companies. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Big data; Commerce; Cost reduction; Deep learning; Gas industry; Gasoline; Hydrocarbon refining; Investments; Predictive analytics; Digital transformation; Intelligent automation; Intelligent enterprise; Optimization potential; Production investments; Technological innovation; Technological process; Traditional approaches; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084165717

However, complex systems are realized due to distributed computing technologies like Web services. With machine-to-machine (M2 M) interaction, human intervention is greatly reduced in distributed applications. Nevertheless, there is need for continuous changes in complex software systems. Manual incorporation of changes is both time consuming and tedious task. The self-adaptive features of software can cater to the needs of ad hoc demands pertaining to changes. Therefore, it is desirable to have a self-adaptive software architecture for distributed systems to adapt to changes automatically without traditional reengineering process involved in software update. The existing solutions do have limitations in self-adaptation and need human intervention. Rainbow is one of the examples for self-adaptive dynamic software architecture. However, it does not have knowledge mining and quality of software analysis for further improvements. It is essential to have such enhancements in the wake of self-adaptive systems of enterprises producing huge amount of data related to operations, service quality and other information required for analysing the architecture. We proposed a self-adaptive dynamic software architecture named enhanced self-adaptive dynamic software architecture (ESADSA) which is influenced by Rainbow. It incorporates modules such as QoS analyser and knowledge miner with two data mining algorithms for enhancing capabilities of the architecture. ESADSA decouples self-adaptation from target system by preserving cohesion of target system with loosely coupled interaction. A real-time case study is considered for proof of the concept. The experimental results revealed significant improvements in dynamic self-adaptation of the proposed architecture. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Dynamic software architecture; Maintainability; Reusability; Self-adaptation","Adaptive systems; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Data mining; Distributed computer systems; Quality of service; Software architecture; Software design; Software quality; Web services; Complex software systems; Data mining algorithm; Distributed applications; Distributed computing technology; Dynamic self-adaptation; Proposed architectures; Self adaptive softwares; Self-adaptive system; Memory architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083970964

Autonomous systems can also help in disaster and humanitarian operations. However, the deployment of systems that are more and more autonomous from humans poses multidimensional challenges for their certification, compliance with ethics and international humanitarian law and present risks to security. Mechanisms for the mitigation of their proliferation to malicious non-state actors and a meaningful human control should be implemented. War gaming in a theoretical, risk-safe environment can assess the threats and impact of robotic weapons on future defense planning and operations.

However, Machine Learning approaches and heuristics are plenty, and most of them require outward knowledge and deep thoughtful of the context to learn the tools fittingly. Furthermore, application of prediction in business has certain considerations that strongly affects the effectiveness of ML techniques such as noisy, criticality, and inaccuracy of business data due to human involvement in an extensive number of business tasks.

Lack of correctly implemented and robust defense leaves the organization's IoT devices vulnerable to numerous cyber threats, such as adversarial and man-in-the-middle attacks or malware infections. A perpetrator can utilize adversarial examples when attacking machine learning (ML) models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or deep neural networks (DNN) used, e.g., in DaaS cloud data platform service of smart buildings. DaaS cloud data platform's function in this study is to connect data from multiple IoT sensors, databases, private on-premises cloud services, public or hybrid cloud services into a metadata database. This study focuses on reviewing adversarial attack threats towards artificial intelligence systems in the smart building's context where the DaaS cloud data platform services under various information propagation chain structures utilizing ML models and reviews. Adversarial examples can be malicious inputs to ML models providing erroneous model outputs while appearing to be unmodified in human eyes. This kind of attack can knock out the classifier, prevent ML model from generalizing well, and from learning high-level representation, but instead to learn superficial dataset regularity.

While some AI is subject to rigid testing and ethical reviews, other applications raise questions as to what governance structures are in place to control the risks to humanity and long term harmful economic and social consequences. This paper raises awareness about how governments and private industry face an unprecedented challenge in managing these complex systems that include regulators, markets, and special interests that all play a role in influencing the development of AI in different contexts without a full appreciation of the impact of AI on human rights and other consequences. The research focuses on three primary areas: (1) How AI technologies have evolved; (2) What are the major ethical and human rights issues evolving from the use of AI in the public and business environment; and (3) how can we improve our frameworks and governance structure for AI regulation.

In this paper, we review and compare a set of nine BP ontologies according to their ability to represent process specification and process execution in a fine-grained way to enable task monitoring. The comparison shows that, on the one hand, ontologies developed from scratch establish a clear distinction between process specification and process execution, but do not allow to represent workflow constraints required for process execution. On the other hand, most of the ontologies, that are ontological versions of existing BP modeling languages, focus only on process specifications but do not represent process execution, or mix the representation of BP specification and execution. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Business intelligence can be seen as the process of converting such information into actionable knowledge, which is the basis for data-driven decision making. With this in mind, this work is framed in a project that seeks to improve the activity of the Portuguese Food and Economic Safety Authority, regarding prevention in the areas of food safety and economic enforcement. More specifically, this paper focuses on the generation and optimization of flexible inspection routes. An optimal inspection route seeks to maximize the number of targeted Economic Operators, or the utility gained from the set of Economic Operators that are actually inspected. For that, each Economic Operator is assigned an inspection utility value. The problem was then modelled as a Multi-Depot Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, and solved using both exact and meta-heuristic methods. The comparison of the meta-heuristic algorithms showed a versatile Hill Climbing implementation in different test cases that explored the effect of the Economic Operators dispersion and density.

Inspired by neuroscience, the paper combines the synaptic networks and graphs of quantum network to constitute interactions as information flow. Hitherto, several machine learning algorithms had some influence in business decision-making under uncertainty, however the dynamic cognitive states and differences thereof, at different timepoints, play an important role in transactional businesses to derive choice and choice-sets for decision-making at societal scale. In addition, deep neural functions that reflect the direction of information flow, the cliques and cavities, necessitate a new computational framework and deeper learning method. This paper introduces a proactive-retroactive learning technique - a quantified measurement of a multi-layered-multi-dimensional architecture based on a Self-Organized Cognitive Algebraic Neural Network (SCANN) integrated with Voronoi geometry - to deduce the optimal (cognitive) state, action, response and reward (pay-off) in more realistic imperfect and incomplete information conditions. This quantified measurement of SCANN produced an efficient and optimal learning results for individuals' transactional activities and for nearest-neighbor, as a group, for which the individual is a member. This paper also discusses and characterizes SCANN for those who handle decisions under conditions of uncertainty, juxtaposed between human and machine intelligence.

Universities now are competing globally, and they are virtually crossing their borders. University governance in general plays a very important role in the running of any university. It directs the university towards achievement of its objectives, and it is affected by the surrounding environment. IT Governance is a subset of the university corporate governance and it is it implemented to govern and manage IT effectively. People, information, technology service, infrastructure, applications, culture ethics, processes, principles, policies, frameworks and organizational structure are the tools for IT Governance. The environmental challenges are threatening the existence of many universities and requiring a prompt attention. IT Governance may be the key for the universities to reposition itself and overcome the problems that threaten their existence. AI is a very important strategic tool that can help smart universities in fulfilling their strategic goals. AI presents challenges and opportunities to the IT Governance function. Literature shows that universities are not fully utilizing their IT capabilities and this a clear evidence that they are having serious issues with their IT Governance practices. This exploratory research aims to investigate the role that IT Governance in enhancing universities performance in areas such as: research, teaching and learning, competitiveness, and resources utilization. We develop a conceptual framework that identifies the environmental factors that impact the university IT Governance structure; and strategical and political enablers and benefits of implementing IT Governance system in universities. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Business/IT alignment; IT Governance; Smart universities; Strategic use of IT; University IT Governance","Computer programming; Computer science; Business/it alignments; Environmental challenges; IT governance; IT governance practices; Organizational structures; Smart universities; Strategic use of IT; Surrounding environment; Artificial intelligence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082995125

Here, a multi-cloud strategy specifies end-to-end connectivity between the multiple cloud providers (CPs) that an enterprise relies on to run its business. This adoption is fueled by the rapid build-out of global-scale private backbones by the large CPs, a rich private peering fabric that interconnects them, and the emergence of new third-party private connectivity providers (e.g., DataPipe, HopOne, etc.). However, little is known about the performance aspects, routing issues, and topological features associated with currently available multi-cloud connectivity options. To shed light on the tradeoffs between these available connectivity options, we take a cloud-to-cloud perspective and present in this paper the results of a cloud-centric measurement study of a coast-to-coast multi-cloud deployment that a typical modern enterprise located in the US may adopt. We deploy VMs in two regions (i.e., VA and CA) of each one of three large cloud providers (i.e., AWS, Azure, and GCP) and connect them using three different options: (i) transit provider-based best-effort public Internet (BEP), (ii) third-party provider-based private (TPP) connectivity, and (iii) CP-based private (CPP) connectivity. By performing active measurements in this real-world multi-cloud deployment, we provide new insights into variability in the performance of TPP, the stability in performance and topology of CPP, and the absence of transit providers for CPP. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Active measurement; Cloud providers; Comparative characterizations; End-to-end connectivity; Measurement study; Performance aspects; Public internet; Topological features; Topology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082991169

AI is actually a framework to define notion of intelligence in software systems or devices in terms of knowledge representation and reasoning methodologies. There are two main types of reasoning methods deductive and inductive over data. The major class of machine learning and deep learning methods come under inductive reasoning where essentially, missing pieces of information are interpolated based on existing data through numerical transformations. However, today AI is mostly identified with deduction systems while it is actually a comprehensive school of thought and formal framework. The AI framework offers rigor and robustness to the solutions developed and there is still scope for onboarding today's deep learning solutions and reap benefits of sturdiness. Data science is about end to end development of a smart solution that involves creation of pipelines for activities for data generation, business decision making and solution maintenance with humans in loop. Data generation is a cycle of activities involving collection, refinement, feature transformations, devising more insightful heuristic measures based on domain peculiarities and iterations to enhance quality of data driven decisions. Business decision making is pipeline of activities involving designing mappers from data to business decisions. The mappers are typically machine learning methods which are fine tuned to give best possible performance in a given period of study subject to business constraints. The mappers are fine tuned based on quality and magnitude of data and subdata. Solution maintenance is a critical component that involves setting up alarms to detect when a given decision maker model no longer works as desired. The maintenance work calls for repair actions such as identifying data to gather, comparative metrics of different models and monitoring the patterns and trends in the input data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Automatic differentiation; Boosting; Data science; Deep learning; Gradient descent; Graphical models; Machine learning; Supervised models; SVD",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082515385

There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined.

Any flaws in the interpretation of analytic results or AI outputs can lead to significant economic loses and reputation damage. Among existing flaws, one of the most often overlooked is the use biased data and imbalanced datasets. When unadverted, data bias warps the meaning of data and has a devastating effect on AI results. Existing approaches deal with data bias by constraining the data model, altering its composition until the data is no longer biased. Unfortunately, studies have shown that crucial information about the nature of data may be lost during this process. Therefore, in this paper we propose an alternative process, one that detects data biases and presents biased data in a visual way so that the user can comprehend how data is structured and decide whether or not constraining approaches are applicable in his context. Our approach detects the existence of biases in datasets through our proposed algorithm and generates a series of visualizations in a way that is understandable for users, including non-expert ones. In this way, users become aware not only of the existence of biases in the data, but also how they may impact their analytics and AI algorithms, thus avoiding undesired results. © Copyright 2020 for this paper held by its author(s).",,"Big data; Data Analytics; AI algorithms; Alternative process; Business decisions; Business Process; Devastating effects; Imbalanced Data-sets; Data handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082437036

Here we conduct a comparative analysis of science and technology in Russia and technologically advanced economies of the world on a number of indicators: gross expenditures on R&D as a percentage of GDP in total and by funding sources, publication activity, number of researchers and number of R&D personnel per thousand employed in the economy, number of R&D enterprises, etc. The results show low degree of investing in R&D in Russia and its sources are funded by the government largely. The lag in the advancement of science and technology relative to leading countries is testified by other indicators. We conclude that Russia needs to draw up its national innovation system to unify innovation process with institutional arrangements as legal acts, business practices, popularization and funding stimulatory mechanisms such as grants, subsidies, soft loans, tax benefits. It will allow to enhance business participating as investors and initiators in R&D projects and technology production. An innovation process also requires to keep and to expand an integration of the triad “science–education– industry” to entire economics with creating clusters that will include real sector enterprises of main and auxiliary production, educational institutions, research institutes with own design bureaus.

The current research of RS can be mainly on content-based, collaborative-based, and hybrid recommendation approaches. The Content-based approach utilizes the profiles of the users and product descriptions for the recommendation of items. Collaborative techniques utilized the behavior of the users and preferences by the user in the past unlike the user’s personal information and product description. Hybrid recommendation systems include the strategies of content-based and collaborative based on effective recommendations. There exist many works in the literature, in which the recommendation of books, articles, and news, etc. are utilizing either content-based or collaborative based techniques and very few works have been done on hybrid recommendation methods.

In the context of formation of information society, digital literacy is pivotal in the solution of problems facing the education. This paper has been prepared in order to provide a scientific substantiation of an integrated approach to solving the problems of improving digital literacy of students and teachers in preparing lawyers for the business sector, as well as increased use of tailored education with the formation of an individual educational path. Methods. In order to achieve the goal set, the authors of research use a number of methods: general scientific (analysis, synthesis, generalization, induction and deduction, classification, interpretation), special scientific (comparative, statistical, sociological). Results. The research has shown that the formation of individual educational paths, designed to be instrumental in training lawyers for the modern economy, implies the introduction of alternative forms of provision of educational services based on digital technologies. This area of development of legal education requires a fundamental change in the level of digital literacy of teachers, as well as acquisition of tutor competencies by them. A wide variety of doctrinal interpretations of the concept of digital literacy prevents from choosing an efficient toolkit for solving the national task of assisting citizens in eliminating digital illiteracy. The digital literacy of teachers should include knowledge and skills in the field of educational policy and ethics of the application of information and communication technologies, the ability to make the best use of them in the teaching process, professional growth and management of educational activities. Comparison of tools that are practically applied in domestic and foreign universities within the framework of the general and specific model of the formation of an individual educational path revealed their advantages and disadvantages, as well as a range of problems of the submodel for individuals with disabilities. Conclusions. The authors offer a suggestion to enshrine the legal definition of the concept of digital literacy in the Russian legislation, to more actively involve major companies in the IT retraining of teachers, particularly teachers of the humanities, within the scope of relevant professional development programs.

Therefore, the development of new processes that facilitate the detection of significant phenomena and future changes is a key component for correct decision making that sets a correct course in the company. For this reason, a business intelligence architecture system is hereby proposed to allow the detection of discrete changes or weak signals in the present, indicative of more significant phenomena and transcendental changes in the future. In contrast to work currently available focusing on structured information sources, or at most with a single type of data source, the detection of these signals is here quantitatively based on heterogeneous and unstructured documents of various kinds (scientific journals, newspaper articles and social networks), to which text mining and natural language processing techniques (a multi-word expression analysis) are applied. The system has been tested to study the future of the artificial intelligence sector, obtaining promising results to help business experts in the recognition of new driving factors of their markets and the development of new opportunities. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

The article is aimed at the study of possible prospects for the implementation of effective methods of satisfaction with public services in Russia based on the foreign countries experience analysis. Under the population satisfaction, authors mean business community representatives as a part of civil society. Structure/Methodology/Approach. In modern conditions, the success of the socio-economic system development depends on the complementary efforts of the state, business and population involved in the solution of the challenges. Such involvement is carried out within state marketing, where the guiding role is the system of public administration; business and the population contribute to the achievement of goals, sharing the overall direction of change and, at the same time, pursuing their own interests. In this regard, it is necessary to study the satisfaction of civil society representatives with the quality of public services provided to them, which predetermined the need to analyze successful practices in foreign countries. Results. The necessity of the introduction of constantly operating monitoring of the satisfaction by services provided by the public administration system was substantiated. Such evaluation should be carried out within the management system, the business community and civil society, it makes it possible to identify the real situation, attitude and involvement of all three parties into the socio-economic development within state marketing. Practical implications. In practice, it is the formation and implementation of a mechanism functions of which are to monitor the degree of the population and business satisfaction with public services provided to them. This approach is aimed at involving business and the population in the management decisions implementation. Originality/value. Within the creation of state marketing interaction focused on the successful socio-economic development in the cooperation of the management system, business community and the population, the satisfaction of all participants in this process acquires a leading role that implies the need for its permanent evaluation and updating the obtained data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Consumer satisfaction index; Evaluation model; Management system; Satisfaction with services; State marketing","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Information management; Marketing; Population statistics; Public administration; Consumer satisfactions; Evaluation modeling; Management decisions; Management systems; Mechanism functions; Satisfaction with services; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic systems; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081693133

Achievement of this purpose requires solving problems related to assessing the role of knowledge in the course of digital transformation, studying the relationship between the concepts of the digital economy and the Industry 4.0, and tackling methodological issues of knowledge introduction in developing business models of activity by enterprises. The methodological background of the study is the concept of the digital economy and “Industry 4.0”, as well as their numerous interpretations in Russian and foreign literature. We considered the main premises of the Industry 4.0 concept and its place in the digital economy. We highlighted the development of digital technologies in Russia, as well as in the most economically developed countries. We showed the place of knowledge in digitalization of the economy, the peculiarities of converting implicit knowledge into explicit form and drew up the pyramid of knowledge. An analysis of the writings dedicated to this problem made it possible to prove the role of the company as a depository of knowledge incorporated into business processes, as well as present areas of knowledge utilization to develop the dynamic capabilities of the company. We proposed a business model of the company’s activity, the distinguishing feature of which is the reliance on key expertise and dynamic capabilities of the company. To sum up, we conclude that foremost enterprises of the real sector of the economy should take part in the execution of the “Digital Economy of the Russian Federation” program, evolving and using innovative business models of activity and developing key expertise and dynamic knowledge-based capabilities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Business model; Digital economy; Dynamic capabilities; Industry – 4.0; Key competencies; Knowledge","Artificial intelligence; Enterprise resource management; Industrial management; Industry 4.0; Knowledge based systems; Business modeling; Digital economy; Dynamic capabilities; Key competencies; Knowledge; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081690301

The trends of transfer to the digital format in modern society necessitate elaboration of multiple issues of mutual relationship of citizens and institutions in various real-life situations (education, healthcare, social care, employment, etc.). The key problems are associated with the need of identifying a person in the digital environment and storing his/her personal data, identifying a legal entity and lawfulness of its legal status. The state authorities have been dealing with these issues over the past few years. Thus, the Ministry of Digital Development of the Russian Federation is currently finalizing legislation on relevant laws and regulations, supplementing it with articles about the digital profile, procedure for identification and authentication of individuals, developing mechanisms for the interaction of individuals and legal entities in the digital infrastructure. The ongoing processes of approval of official documents and elimination of legal issues have been the subject of study in this scientific paper. Goal/Problems. The goal of this research study is the theoretical justification of ongoing processes, the search for practical methods of promotion and improvement of the efficiency of interaction of business entities, government institutions and a citizen in the digital environment. In accordance with this goal, the following problems have been formulated and consistently solved in this paper: to study the ongoing processes of digitization of social milieu, to identify the key problems of interaction in the digital environment, give consideration to particular qualities of an individual forming the digital profile, to analyze changes in the legal regulation of the digital interaction. Methodology. The study is conducted with the use of methods of regulatory analysis of ongoing changes in legislation, statistical data analysis, logical analysis method, data systematization, method of comparison, analogy and systematization. Results. In order to ensure the most effective and efficient interaction of citizens and government institutions in the digital environment, conditions for the formation of a digital profile of individuals and legal entities are established, which will allow solving many issues remotely. The paper identifies a list of problems, the solution of which will ensure the promotion of digital technologies into economic and social space. Conclusions/Significance. The value of this paper consists in the fact that it focuses on the key problems of digitization of Russian society, the main planned activities to modernize the existing online services. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Authentication; Digital profile; Identification; Legal regulation; Online service","Artificial intelligence; Authentication; Identification (control systems); Personal computing; Digital infrastructures; Digital profile; Efficient interaction; Government institutions; Laws and regulations; Legal regulation; On-line service; Statistical data analysis; Laws and legislation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081685033

Stability at the macroeconomic level is accompanied by a ratio of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, due to which equilibrium is achieved. In the digital economy, several major transformations of the world economy are taking place at once: national borders are eroding, the role of the state in regulating monetary policy is decreasing, the role of institutional competition between different jurisdictions is growing, the flows of labor and capital are expanding, and uncontrolled global Internet platforms - business giants, are emerging which determine the direction of world development. The chapter shows the trends in the world economy under the influence of digitalization, and also highlights three effects: economies of scale, ratchet and hysteresis, as areas of research. Their influence on the ongoing economic processes on a planetary scale begins to manifest itself somewhat differently than in the framework of national economies, which makes their study relevant for understanding the ongoing global processes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Digital economy; Economies of scale; Hysteresis; Ratchet effect; Sustainability","Aggregates; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Hysteresis; Sustainable development; Aggregate demands; Digital economy; Economic growths; Economies of scale; Monetary policies; National economy; Ratchet effects; Technological perspective; Economic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081642719

Design/methodology/approach: The designed approach uses the CRM evaluation by 8 criteria, such as automatic procedures, social media integration or key performance indicators. The final evaluation uses a Fuller triangle to determine weights of specified criteria and the TOPSIS method to specify performance scores by CRM variability of CRM services. Findings: Achieved results show the level of availability in specified CRM services (criteria) with variability for top, middle, bottom, popular, or affordable CRM. An overview is also available through selected CRMs. Research implications: Based on achieved results, changes are visible in the interest of CRM services. There is a variety for automatic procedures, templates and filters that provide good support for instant solutions. Future research will focus on artificial intelligence for automatic procedures in CRMs. Practical implications: This analysis shows that automatic procedures are high on eWay-CRM, HarmonyPSA, HubSpot CRM, itracMarketer, and Zoho CRM, which offers the largest volume of automatic procedures. In terms of variability using templates and filters, Zoho CRM, HubSpot CRM and eWay-CRM are recommended for small businesses. Originality/value: The value of this paper is in a global view through CRMs from different ranking. Originality is visible in the hierarchy of the most useful CRM services for small businesses based on experience from the Czech Republic in a region with high unemployment. © 2019 SERSC.","Computer software; Customer relationship management; Information and knowledge; IT services; Marketing; Small business",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081626521

This study, finds that India can leverage on the 7,500 long coast line and derive holistic development in terms of interconnected ports with hinterland connectivity and realize lower expenditure coupled with reduced carbon emission. This research analyzed a decade of cargo data from origination to destination and found that around 82.95 per cent (953 MMTPA in 2017-18) of road based consignments in India comprised of Fertilizers, Hydrocarbons, Coal, Lubricants and Oil. Essentially, a quantum of this i.e. 78.39 per cent of MMTPA cargo consignments (State Owned Hydrocarbons) traverses on Indian roads. The study drew parameters of this transportation paradigm and modeled the same using Artificial Intelligence to depict a monumental opportunity to rationalize costs, improve efficiency and reduce carbon emission to strengthen the argument for the employment of Multimodal Logistics in the Maritime Sector. Subsequent to model derivation the same set of parameters are plotted as an efficient transit map of Interstate transit lines connecting 16 major hubs which now handle bulk cargo shipped by all modes of transport. For the pollution segment a collaborative game theoretic approach i.e., Shapley value is proposed for improved decision making. This study presents data driven and compelling research evidence to portray the benefits of collaboration between firms in terms of time and cost. The study also proposes the need and method to improve hinterland connectivity using a scalable greedy algorithm which is tested with real time data of Coal and Bulk Cargo.

My impression is that the journey is starting all over again as organizations start using AI technology as black box systems. I think that eventually these companies will also start asking for methods that result in more reliable project outcomes and integrated business systems. The idea that explainable AI is at the expense of accuracy is deeply rooted in the AI community. Unfortunately, this has hampered research into good explainable models and indicates that the human factor in AI is underestimated. Driven by governments asking for transparency, a public asking for unbiased decision making and compliance requirements on business and industry, a new trend and research area is emerging.

While organizations layout their roadmap to achieve transformations, they often invest in techniques and methodologies without a vision on business analytics, intelligence and end up creating a non-manageable platform and data graveyard. The illusion of achieving the silver lining in analytics and data insights for business is creating a critical roadblock in the path of optimized and scalable mechanisms of developing a well-oiled data management system. With the growing practices in designing business data management and analytics systems, it is a complex problem to design a scalable and a mature system. Here, we try to discuss on how to, with the changing dimension of platform offerings, use portability as one of the key parameters to scale efficiently and effectively. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a key component in many optimizations in specific scenario of software applications but when it comes to business data management, we only use it for insights, predictions and seldom map the power of AI to manage the data effectively.

Electrical and Computer Engineering, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea","Virtual reality (VR), a technology field that implements human- computer interaction, creates a reality that does not really exist; provides new and changed environments for humans to recognize. A significant amount of VR content is produced in Korea by small businesses or start-ups, and more than 50% of VR content companies are involved in developing content related to video entertainment, such as games [11]. The game screen depicts scenes seen through a virtual camera installed in a 3D space. Cameras in the game are virtual, without substance, but they work on the same principle as real cameras. Various technologies and testing processes for camera editing have been developed for both ""real"" cameras and VR camera work. Nevertheless, depending on momentary changes in characters' various actions and situations, it still takes a lot of effort and time for filming directors to set up, edit, and provide camera locations to users. This has resulted in an increased need for intelligent camera functions, as well as heightened technical demands to automatically judge behavior, dialogue, and blind spots in camera images - intelligent control. Accordingly, considerable research has been focused recently on applying intelligent cameras to story creation to determine and analyze the behavior between real interacting with simulated VR. This paper proposes an intelligent camera imaging technique using artificial intelligence's FSM technology within the Unity game engine to control the camera. The solution is based on the Hitchcock rule widely used in camera-shooting technique.

Disruptive technologies and their disruptive use models are creating a new world and a different future. Over the last few years, the creation and utilization of technologies has played a critical role to improve the life quality of people, advance economies, and open new horizons for individuals, businesses, and even nations around the world. This is the bright side! On the other side, the world is experiencing nowadays exceptional technology disruption that has triggered an enormous change; a change that is behind the classical control of the governments and local authorities, and fueled by ongoing nonstop innovation and substantial evolution in the means people employ technology. Governments are usually are not aware of these disruption and its effects; even if they are aware, the structure of most governments is not agile enough to deal with such disruptions and governments are not fully taking advantages for such disruption to progress their nations and the whole world on the social and economic levels. Technology disruption is affecting seriously the markets, the governments, the organizations, the monetary system and the employment, and consequently is affecting the lives of the people. In other words, technology is disrupting the classical models on the economic, political and social levels. This is happening at a pace that could lead to an unprecedented advancement coupled with a complete chaos. Therefore, the role of the management of technology has become more vital and critical than ever. A role that should be seriously considered while thinking of the future model of governments. Based on that, the paper outlines the major technological trends, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Shared Economy Platforms, Autonomous Vehicles and Drones, and their possible effect on the economic, political and social levels. Also, the paper draws the future role of the management of technology, as well as the future model of government, in this regards to maximize the positive impact of the technological disruption and minimize the chances that could lead to the chaos. The approach used in the paper is based on thorough analysis of the reports issued by international institutions in the areas of technological disruption and its effect, desk research, and interviews with key personnel in the government, Business Representative Organizations (BROs), NGOs and private sector, in addition to youth, startups and entrepreneurs. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

The UAE's logistics industry is expanding its wings as new entrepreneurs are entering the field, contributing new technology-based solutions and services. The blending of conventional logistics players and start-ups can be seen in the UAE. The challenge in the logistics market is how the existing companies face the positive competition from newcomers which are well versed in using new trends such as artificial intelligence, and the business is transparent by the internet growth whereas traditional logistics company uses networking. The revolution of the internet has supported the logistic companies to assemble the buyers and sellers in a single platform with better process giving simple solution unlike the old lengthy method of finding vehicles, fleet and tracking delivery points. Due to rapid expeditious, enlarging trade volume, revival of the worldwide economy, extraordinary development of construction and large-scale projects, development of transportation infrastructure and geographical location of the UAE which is an added advantage connecting the trading pathways of the West, Europe, Africa and Asia, have made the UAE as an international transit hub. Due to the improvement of growth of business dynamics all over the world, outsourcing is a huge market in the United Arab Emirates. Previously various studies were undertaken to find the third-party logistics status in different countries. To the author's understanding, there was no survey conducted before in the United Arab Emirates from provider perspective and based on the capital city of Abu Dhabi. The aim of this research is to conduct a survey in order to examine the 3PL status in different areas. This paper reveals the maximum percentages of 3PL customers are satisfied with their present 3PL service provider and it has led the positive impact on the customer gratification and reduction of the logistics cost.

The methodology of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is used to develop a decision support system framework and tool. By leveraging the principles of the sharing economy, a social issue within a community is identified and possible alternatives for business models to address the issue are generated and investigated. The model is built to be generic and flexible in order to be applied in any environment where different resources are available to utilize. The model is applied on a case study of a house in Velddrif, South Africa. In our case study, a filtering process explore various alternatives for utilising a house resulting in a prioritisation of three options (a house for the Homeless, vegetable gardening enterprise and a workshop and employee bureau) along with the development of a business model for each. By calculating economic and potential social value of each option, the necessary trade-offs and comparisons can be made. The risks involved in each enterprise are taken into account so that the champion of the project can make informed decisions regarding which concept to execute. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

However, the paradox of our time is that this data is not used to its full potential to provide companies with powerful impetus for their development. This is especially true at the strategic level, where company executives still mostly make decisions without relying on the recommendations of business intelligence systems. In the management of road transport, this phenomenon can be attributed to the fragmentation of data sources and the vague understanding of the relationships between them. This is also partially due to the diversity in opinions in the expert community on the efficiency of the transport processes. Thus, it is obvious that, without deciding on how to measure efficiency, it is hard to say where the data for calculations should be acquired from and what should be the architecture of a decision support system.

The existing change management models bridge the gap between motivation, planning, and implementation. These models are highly significant as the organizational change is not a rare event anymore, but it is an ongoing process, and the 'business as usual' model becomes insignificant to most organizations. To automatize the theoretical model of change management, an intelligent and adaptive model for change management is developed in this paper, which takes into consideration all the positive and negative effects (factors) that may take place at any time and any place internally (internal factors) or externally (external factors). Based on these factors, accordingly, the proposed model can efficiently find a reasonable solution that adapts to the existing situation to avoid any failure of organizational management. The proposed system is built based on a decision support system (DSS) with inputs that represent the influencing factors and an output that represents feedback on the method of management. In this paper, the proposed change management model has been verified, and the results have been reported accordingly. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.","Change management; Decision support system (DSS); External environment; Internal environment","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Adaptive models; Business-as-usual; Change management; Decision support system; External environments; Intelligent models; Internal environment; Management Model; Organizational change; Theoretical modeling; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080145552

However, various industry giants have with major data breaches in the past few years. These data breaches have exposed vital data of millions of customers. Therefore, businesses are constantly looking for better alternatives to traditional security models. Biometrics such as fingerprint and iris scans are being utilized for authenticating employees at the workplace and identifying smartphone owners. Such biometrics can be implemented in organizations to authorize data access for confidential data. Biometrics can be used along with traditional passwords or PIN numbers for multi-factor authentication. Additionally, the adoption of AI will help develop data-driven security protocols. Hence, clubbing AI and biometrics together will lead to the creation of dynamic security models.AI systems can minimize' human error ' events, provided they are properly programmed and can contribute to making quicker choices through cognitive techniques. It is considered to be a very effective technology as it challenges the hackers to penetrate and ensures safety among the users. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.

Artificial intelligence allows computers to analyze very large amounts of information and data, reach logical conclusions on many important topics, and make difficult decisions, this will help consumers and businesses make better decisions to improve their lives, and it will also help startups and small companies achieve great long-term success. Currency exchange rates are important matters for both governments, companies, banks and consumers. The decision tree is one of the most widely artificial intelligence tools used in data mining. With the development of this field the decision tree and Gradient boosting decision tree are used to predicate through constructed intelligent predictive system based on it. These algorithms have been used in many stock market forecasting systems based on global market data. The Iraqi dinar exchange rates for the US dollar are affected in local markets, depending on the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Iraq and the features of that auction. The proposed system is used to predict the dollar exchange rates in the Iraq markets Depending on the daily auction data of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI). The decision tree and Gradient boosting decision tree was trained and testing using dataset of three-year issued by the CBI and compare the performance of both algorithms and find the correlation between the data. (Runtime, accuracy and correlation) criteria are adopted to select the best methods.

Key innovations include big data analytics, artificial intelligence, data science, digital currency, social media, blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). Many of these technologies are interdependent. IoT is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable integrated computing devices within the infrastructure of the surrounding computer network. In the field of banking services, the interconnection of those integrated equipment should allow the automation of several legacy processes. As the digital transformation driven by IoT begins to take root, new business models and products emerge. This opens new frontiers for innovation that can change customer behavior in the banking industry. The objective of this chapter is to highlight and illustrate the different uses of IoT in banking. We also analyze the impact of digital risks based on the Internet of Things on the traditional banking processes. It would be of interest to bring together the different types of digital risks that have a similar impact on bank’s processes. We analyze those technologies to implement the digital transformation using new practices. We develop an approach based on a bipartite graph associating the processes and risks of the banking sector.

It is increasingly recognized that the systems of the future will contain some form of adaptivity therefore making them intelligent systems as opposed to the static systems of the past. These intelligent systems can be extremely complex and difficult to maintain. Descriptions at higher-level of abstraction (system-level) have long been identified by industry and academia to reduce complexity. This research presents a Framework of Classification algorithms at system-level that enables quick experimentation with several different algorithms from Naive Bayes to Logistic Regression. It has been developed as a tool to address the requirements of British Telecom's (BT's) data-science team. The tool has been presented at BT and JetBrains MPS and feedback has been collected and evaluated. Beyond the reduction in complexity through the system-level description, the most prominent advantage of this research is its potential applicability to many application contexts.

Modi University, Newai, Tonk, Pali, Rajasthan, India","Large amount of digital data is generated rapidly all around the globe. Providing security to digital data is the crucial issue in almost all types of organizations. According to the Identity Theft Resource Center, there were 8069 data breaches between January 2005 and November 2017 [1]. In the year 2018, 477 cases registered about data breach [2]. In just three months of 2019, 145 such cases are already noticed [GK et al. in A study on dynamic data masking with its trends and implications. 38(2), 0975–8887, 3], and it continues to grow. Protecting the digital sensitive data from data breaches is the need of the hour. The main objective is to protect the privacy of individuals and society which is becoming crucial for effective functioning across businesses. Privacy enforcement today is being handled primarily through government monitored regulations and compliances. To overcome the limitations of existing masking methods, researcher proposed a non-zero random replacement masking method. Researcher has successfully developed a scalable data masking model which can be used for various data types—CSV, JSON, XML, and relational databases. To evaluate the proposed method, researcher used an internationally recognized UCI repository which is an open source of secondary data, out of 436 datasets available on the site; researcher selected five different datasets of various business domains. The selected business data is under five different categories—healthcare, social media, bank marketing, bank finance, and stock market. The researcher also contemplated about volume of datasets. Researcher applied three types of masking—substitution, shuffling, and proposed method on the selected datasets. The original dataset and masked datasets are classified by classification metric. Performance parameters measured on four different classifiers delivered sizeable variations. With respect to data samples used for analysis, results strongly augmented that the proposed data masking method can be used across the business-critical domains. The results strongly emphasize that the proposed model is the solution which not only protects the sensitive data but also maintains the usability, accuracy, and sensitivity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.","Compliances; Masking; Non-production environment; Production environment; Shuffling; Substitution","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Speech intelligibility; Substitution reactions; Compliances; Effective Functioning; Performance parameters; Privacy enforcement; Production environments; Random replacements; Relational Database; Shuffling; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079641639

However, framing resilient and correct smart contracts (SCs) for these smart application is a quite challenging task because of the complexity associated with them. SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed.

The establishment of financial sharing requires a large amount of data research, which requires the help of artificial intelligence to carry out relevant data statistics. Using big data and artificial intelligence technology to improve the financial sharing service platform can further liberate human resources and promote capital integration, which is an important way for the financial sharing service center to play its role in creating value. Finally, the improvement work should properly deal with the balance between centralization and decentralization, actively extend the business and expand the professional skills of financial personnel. However, we must see its two sides in the development process and avoid the problems in the research. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Financial sharing; Operational efficiency","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Efficiency; Embedded systems; Finance; Smart city; Wages; Artificial intelligence research; Artificial intelligence technologies; Centralization and decentralizations; Development process; Financial sharing; Operation efficiencies; Operational efficiencies; Shared service center; Data Sharing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079544724

It has been actively adopted in many business applications such as conversational intelligence systems, news articles categorizations, sentiment analysis, emotion detection systems, and many other recommendation systems in our daily life. One of the problems in supervised text classification models is that the models’ performance depends heavily on the quality of data labeling that is typically done by humans. In this study, we propose a new network community detection-based approach to automatically label and classify text data into multiclass value spaces. Specifically, we build networks with sentences as the network nodes and pairwise cosine similarities between the Term Frequency-Inversed Document Frequency (TFIDF) vector representations of the sentences as the network link weights. We use the Louvain method to detect the communities in the sentence networks. We train and test the Support Vector Machine and the Random Forest models on both the human-labeled data and network community detection labeled data. Results showed that models with the data labeled by the network community detection outperformed the models with the human-labeled data by 2.68–3.75% of classification accuracy. Our method may help developments of more accurate conversational intelligence and other text classification systems. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Cosine similarity; Document networks; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Network community detection; Network science; Sentence networks; Text classification; TF-IDF; Topic modeling",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079168199

To avoid late-stage failure, learnings from past projects and the development of new approaches are crucial. New modalities and emerging new target spaces allow the exploration of unprecedented indications or to address so far undrugable targets. Late-stage attrition is usually attributed to the lack of efficacy or to compound-related safety issues. Efficacy has been shown to be related to a strong genetic link to human disease, a better understanding of the target biology, and the availability of biomarkers to bridge from animals to humans. Compound safety can be improved by ligand optimization, which is becoming increasingly demanding for difficult targets. Therefore, new strategies include the design of allosteric ligands, covalent binders, and other modalities. Design methods currently heavily rely on artificial intelligence and advanced computational methods such as free energy calculations and quantum chemistry.

The combination of the best explanatory variables makes the model more accurate. Variable importance analysis using Random Forest (RF) was performed to find variables that are important for each objective variable. This analysis shows that the accuracy of the prediction model of the leakage current is the highest when the explanation variable is the data of the security business core system, the weather data, the presence / absence of alarms on the previous day.

In the workplace, this issue is more complex because of the power imbalance between potential perpetrators and victims. Preventing sexual cyberbullying in organizations is very important for a safety and respectful workplace. Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards establish certain policies to be considered to create an organizational culture based on zero tolerance to sexual cyberbullying. The research aims to broaden knowledge about personality and sexual cyberbullying. Therefore, this paper proposes a crucial tool to explore potential sexual cyberbullying behaviour. This study analysed how personality traits, particularly those related to the Dark Triad (psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism), might influence this behaviour. Participants (N = 374) were Spanish young adults, using the convenience sampling to recruit them. The methodology focused on the use of structural equation modelling and ensemble classification tree. First, we tested the proposed hypotheses with structural equation method based on covariance using the Lavaan R-package. Second, for the ensemble of classification trees, we applied the package randomForest and Adabag (bagging and boosting) in R. Results proposed high levels of psychopathy and Machiavellianism are more likely to be related to sexual cyberbullying behaviours. Organizations could use the tool proposed in this research to develop internal policies and procedures for detection and deterrence of potential cyberbullying behaviours. By raising awareness about cyberbullying behaviour including its conceptualisation and measurement in training courses, organizations might build an organizational culture based on a respectful workplace without sexual cyberbullying behaviours.

However, in real time or online mood, BD analytic become more challenging and requires Online Classification Models. In real time mood, the nature of input streams (input data) and target classes (output class) are dependent and non-identically distributed, which cause deterioration in OCM. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and mitigate the causes of this deterioration in OCM and improve OCM performance in RTBDE. This study investigates some fundamental causes of deterioration of Online Classification Models and discusses some possible mitigation approaches.

The ability to recognize objects, faces, and speech, requires, however, exceptional computational power and time, which is conflicting with the current difficulties in transistor scaling due to physical and architectural limitations. As a result, to accelerate the progress of AI, it is necessary to develop materials, devices, and systems that closely mimic the human brain. In this work, we review the current status and challenges on the emerging neuromorphic devices for brain-inspired computing. First, we provide an overview of the memory device technologies which have been proposed for synapse and neuron circuits in neuromorphic systems. Then, we describe the implementation of synaptic learning in the two main types of neural networks, namely the deep neural network and the spiking neural network (SNN). Bio-inspired learning, such as the spike-timing dependent plasticity scheme, is shown to enable unsupervised learning processes which are typical of the human brain. Hardware implementations of SNNs for the recognition of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns are also shown to support the cognitive computation in silico. Finally, we explore the recent advances in reproducing bio-neural processes via device physics, such as insulating-metal transitions, nanoionics drift/diffusion, and magnetization flipping in spintronic devices. By harnessing the device physics in emerging materials, neuromorphic engineering with advanced functionality, higher density and better energy efficiency can be developed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Neuromorphic devices; Resistive switching; Synaptic plasticity","Biomimetics; Brain; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Neural networks; Brain-inspired computing; Hardware implementations; Neuromorphic; Neuromorphic engineering; Resistive switching; Spike timing dependent plasticities; Spiking neural network(SNN); Synaptic plasticity; Deep neural networks; article; nerve cell plasticity",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077775829

DDoS attack makes an online service unavailable to legitimate users by sending voluminous number of dummy requests or by exploiting some vulnerability or security flaws present in current Internet infrastructure. Information present on Internet needs to be defended against DDoS attack by not only technological means but also with the help of economic means using incentives as a tool. In this paper, we have proposed a model using a network management strategy which involves policies to maintain quality of service (QoS) during a DDoS attack. User must have sending rights in the form of contract to access server. A XML form having different fields on QoS parameters is provided by the service provider which a user has to fill with the help of policies present in policy pool. This XML form is turned into contract after evaluation by the control broker. Policy-based network management (PBNM) is used to execute proposed approach which enables user to have dynamic negotiation with the service provider on the cost and types of resources. Proposed model has been implemented on NS2.

Yet, predictions of the stock market pose a challenging exercise, even to the brightest and sharpest minds in the business. Prediction of stock market is never an easy task, due to the complexity and dynamic characteristics of the data it deals with. Bulk amount of the data output generated by the stock market is considered to be a treasure house of knowledge for investors; several studies have been conducted in an attempt to predict the stock market trends. Hence, it is imminent to uncover the behavior of the stock market data in order to avoid future investment risks for the investors. Here we tried a different approach for solving this problem by combining two different components: sentiment analysis on stock-related news reports and historic data analysis. The primary aim of this study was to construct an efficient model to predict trends in the stock market, with minimum error ratio and with maximum accuracy possible for the prediction. This model achieved notably better accuracy as compared to the models created in the previous studies. Two datasets were used in this study. A historical dataset containing the stock values of over ten 11, xxxx companies in the previous years, and a sentiment dataset containing the stock market news reports from social media and other online sources. The first step was to analyze the stock reports and classify them either as a positive or a negative sentiment. Lexicon method of text sentiment classification was used for this purpose. Predictions at this stage achieved an accuracy of 67.14%. The second step of this study used ts and ARIMA functions to predict stock trend, using the historical dataset. In the final step, results from both the components were combined together, to predict stock prices in future. This improved the prediction accuracy up to 89.80%. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020","Historic data analysis; Lexicon method; Sentiment analysis; Stock market prediction","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Data handling; Financial markets; Forecasting; Sentiment analysis; Dynamic characteristics; Historic data; Historical dataset; Lexicon method; Negative sentiments; Prediction accuracy; Sentiment classification; Stock market prediction; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076831539

The innovation process requires adequate fund, resources and a law for sufficient protection of the intellectual properties. Venture capitals (VCs) from risk capital finances (RCFs) are one of the best sources of gathering private equity for small companies. RCFs back those firms which are more innovative and produce more valuable patents which are protected by intellectual property rights (IPR). However, sheer negligence and inadequately unbalanced IPR culture within the software industries fail to communicate the commercial value of those assets to potential investors and business partners to grab the finances. As a result, the software companies fall short of turning their ideas into commercially viable product. Yet, a balanced IPR culture must take into account the cases of IPR abuse and secure the risk capitals.

Through a review of existing sociological literature, in this article, we critically examine the relationship between data and society and propose a new model for understanding these dynamics. “Using the concept of the informatic,” we argue the relationship between data and society can be understood as representing the interaction of several different social trends around data; that of data interfaces (that connect individuals to digital contexts), data circulation (trends in the movement and storage of data), and data abstraction (data manipulation practices). Data and data technologies are founded to be entwined and embedded in numerous social relationships, and while not all are fair and equitable relationships, there is ample evidence of the deeply social nature of data across many streams of social life. Our three-part informatic framework allows these complex relationships to be understood in the social dynamic through which they are witnessed and experienced. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076722378

The contribution of this paper is that we determine and test a framework for the generation and evaluation of AmI system designs, based on user experience and business criteria. Specifically, the process of designing a personal lighting AI agent, in collaboration with a leading lighting design company, is used as a case study to determine and test a framework for the generation and evaluation of AmI system designs based on feasibility and acceptability. First, we use storytelling videos to describe and communicate the user values and design scenarios to the stakeholders. Second, we generate design proposals for a lighting AmI agent based on five distinct systemic factors, namely: (a) the context of interaction; (b) the required system data; (c) the required sensing input; (d) the required user input; and (e) the desired system output. Finally third we determine an evaluation framework that is based on three distinct levels of in-built system intelligence, from lower to higher. The three levels reflect the feasibility and acceptability of the system. Feasibility is what a specific company is capable of producing, and in what timeframe. Acceptability is the potential of familiarity and trust that the users can feel while interacting with the AI agent. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ambient Intelligence; Design vision; Evaluation framework; Generation framework; User Experience","Ambient intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Lighting; Systems analysis; Agent system designs; Ambient intelligent; Evaluation framework; Generation framework; Lighting designs; System intelligence; Systemic factors; User experience; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075699047

Research shows, however, that sales forecasts of new products are highly inaccurate due to scarcity of historical data and weakness in subjective judgements required to compensate for lack of data. The present study explores sales forecasting performed by human groups and compares the accuracy of group forecasts generated by traditional polling to those made using real-time Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI), a technique which has been shown to amplify the forecasting accuracy of human teams in a wide range of fields. In collaboration with a major fashion retailer and a major fashion publisher, three groups of fashion-conscious millennial women (each with 15 participants) were asked to predict the relative sales volumes of eight clothing products (sweaters) during the 2018 holiday season, first by ranking each sweater’s sales in an online poll, and then using an online software platform called Swarm to form an ASI system. The Swarm-based forecasts were significantly more accurate than polling such that the top four sweaters ranked using Swarm sold 23.7% more units than the top four sweaters as ranked by survey, (p = 0.0497). These results suggest that ASI swarms of small groups can be used to forecast sales with significantly higher accuracy than a traditional polling. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Business insights; Collective intelligence; Customer intelligence; Customer research; Market research; Marketing; Product forecasting; Sales forecasting; Swarm intelligence","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Marketing; Sales; Surveys; Swarm intelligence; Collective intelligences; Customer intelligences; Customer research; Market researches; Product forecasting; Sales forecasting; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075672109

The digitalization in logistics operations, such as transportation, warehousing, inventory planning, sourcing, and return can provide firms high levels of flexibility and efficiency that are key to competitiveness in the era of Industry 4.0. In this regard, many buzzwords (technologies) are discussed in the discourses of Industry 4.0, emphasizing their key importance for the successful digitalization of logistics operations. However, the lack of clear understanding on these buzzwords and their interrelations is a barrier to firms’ determination of a clear road map for the digitalization process. For this reason, this study aims to initially introduce the Industry 4.0 enabling technologies (buzzwords), expected to be widely used in logistics operations in the immediate future, and then reveals the linkages between these technologies. To this end, this study applies the fuzzy-total interpretative structure modelling on the Industry 4.0 enabling technologies, which are big data analytics, internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud technology, 3D printing, augmented reality, 5G connection, and autonomous vehicles. The results show that most Industry 4.0 enabling technologies are interdependent, but to different degrees.

As the maritime and logistics sector moves toward fully digital, AI becomes significant competition element for leading shipping companies in business logistics and maritime nations. Although the use of artificial intelligence requires great investment in the short term, it brings profitability by reducing the costs in the long term. Moreover the environmental regulations of IMO (International Maritime Organization) will hit the maritime industry in 2020 by forcing maritime companies to reduce sulfur content in fuel at 0.5%. From this aspect, using AI will also contribute to reduce ship related carbon emissions by implementing environmentally friendly applications. On the other hand, profitability of seaports will scale up by using emerging technologies that helps accurate forecasts by using scientific innovations related with empty and full container records and their allocations. Moreover, using AI will contribute to the prevention of ship related accidents by anticipating future cases with using pinpoint calculations. Lastly, the basic requirement of implementing sustainable development which is necessary to compete is to follow and implement technological innovations as AI.

This methodology relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for model development. An appropriate control-oriented model is a critical component in MPC; model development is no easy task, and it often requires significant technical expertise, effort and time, along with a substantial amount of information. AI techniques enable rapid development and calibration of models using a limited amount of information (i.e. measurements of few variables) while achieving relatively high accuracy. In this study, the MPC algorithm targets the reduction of natural gas consumption by optimizing the transition between night set-back and daytime indoor air set-point values as a function of the expected weather. This MPC strategy was implemented in an institutional building in Varennes (QC), Canada, during the heating season 2018–19.

This is mainly because of the evident benefits of using cloud-based solutions like high availability, scalability or redundancy, which are impossible or too much costly to be achieved on-premises. Cloud platforms may reduce considerably the costs and difficulty of maintenance, while offering flexible solutions to each need (Talukder and Zimmerman in Computing. computer communications and networks. Springer, London, 2010 [1]). Enterprises have a lot of services available to their needs, some of them very basic like a database, a web site or storage, but also many other advanced services for business intelligence, big data, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. However, from the architectural point of view, cloud-based solutions suppose some challenges not existing in traditional on-premises solutions that must be tackled during the engineering process. Whether a monolithic application may fit well on-premises, cloud environments work better with modularization and separation of services. This separation and distribution of services requires additional work to define communications between components and provide security techniques to guarantee data protection against potential risks like data loss, privacy breaks, unwanted access, etc. (Ghaffari et al. in 2016 8th international symposium on telecommunications (IST). IEEE, pp 105–110, 2016 [2]). Performance is also critical in cloud-based solutions, especially when services are located in different nodes on the internet. All these concerns suppose a quite big learning curve to the technical team that prevents some enterprises to move to cloud, especially when they try to migrate already existing solutions. This chapter discusses about the ins and outs of engineering a cloud-based solution applied to a real use case. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Architecture; Cloud; Engineering; Performance; Security","Artificial intelligence; Digital storage; Modular construction; Privacy by design; Architectural points; Cloud development; Cloud environments; Computer Communications; Emerging technologies; Engineering process; High availability; Technological infrastructure; Storage as a service (STaaS)",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074697629

The deterioration process of the RMU cable joint is multivariable and nonstationary over time. Existing fault detection models for the RMU cable joint are single-variable and static over time. A novel algorithm of adaptive time neighborhood preserving embedding (ATNPE) is proposed in this paper, a multivariable time series statistical algorithm with online learning ability to improve the robustness and generalization ability of cable joint fault detection. This method combines an approximate linear dependence (ALD) condition with the time neighborhood preserving embedding (TNPE). New independent samples were determined by calculating the ALD value between new samples and modeling samples. In addition, the new independent samples were used to update the TNPE model. The offline training module was used to update RMU fault detection based on the TNPE model by training new samples with historical offline data. The online updating module trained the historical model to ensure the correct rate of online detection. The experimental results indicated that the method has the ability to adapt to new samples and the squared prediction error statistic limit responded to changes in statistical characteristics of monitoring data. The method can effectively reduce the false alarm rate and has the same fault detection rate compared to the existing model.

A qualitative approach was conducted by interviewing auditors from the five largest auditing firms in France. This paper demonstrates that digital technology is impacting at five key levels audit firms especially the audit role as a governance mechanism. Digitalization will improve the audit relevance (1) allowing audit firms to extend their offers by proposing new services (2). It will also improve the audit quality mainly by analysing all data's customer (3). Finally, with the digitalization a new auditor profile emerges (4), enabling the culture of innovation within audit firms (5). Thus, the firm governance will be improved but the managers ‘discretionary power will be limited. This research highlights the importance of implementing digital strategies to provide regulators with the necessary modifications that need to occur for audit standards.

These technological changes are due to modernization in industries for Business Intelligence (BI) i.e., 4th Industrial Revolution. Among the other ML approaches, Image Classification plays a significant role for Business Intelligence and upfront several new challenges in online and non-stationary environment, such as Concept Drift. To overcome the CD issue, one of the fundamental requirements is optimization of classifier. Whereas, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is considered best classifier/model for Image Classification. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the optimize architecture for CNN in Concept Drifted environment. This study examines the variety of CNN architectures (CNN1 to CNN4) through different configuration of CNN layers and tuning parameters under certain Concept Drift scenarios.

Nowadays, OSNs have a major impact on business, healthcare, agriculture, and society. Reaching the target audience efficiently through OSNs is most desirable to various organizations. Identifying influential nodes through online social network analysis enables to reach the target audience most effectively and thus has drawn significant attention from the researchers. In the recent past, several techniques have been proposed for finding influential nodes in OSNs. Though the activity behaviors of individual user play an important role in the influence maximization, most of the works in this area does not consider this.

Even though organizations and business turn to known network monitoring tools such as Wireshark, millions of people are still vulnerable because of lack of information pertaining to website behaviors and features that can amount to an attack. In fact, most of the attacks do not occur because of threat actors’ resort to complex coding and evasion techniques but because victims lack the basic tools to detect and avoid the attacks. Despite these challenges, machine learning is proving to revolutionize the understanding of the nature of cyber-attacks, and this study implemented machine learning techniques to Phishing Website data with the objective of comparing five algorithms and providing insight that the general public can use to avoid phishing pitfalls. The findings of the study suggest that Neural Network is the best performing algorithm and the model suggest that inclusion of an IP address in the domain name, longer URL, use of URL shortening services, inclusion of “@” symbol in the URL, inclusion of “−” symbol in the URL, use of non-trusted SSL certificates with expiry duration less than 6 months, domains registered for less than one year, and favicon redirecting from other URLs as the leading features of phishing websites.

The use of artificial intelligence in business and finance has a promising future. Artificial intelligence is inspired by the behavior of biological patterns, having also the ability to learn and then capture these strongly non-linear dependencies. The advantage of artificial neural networks consists in their capability of working with big data, in the precision of their results or easier use of the obtained neural network. The objective of this contribution is to carry out systematic literary research of the most renowned scientific resources and find out whether it is possible to use artificial intelligence in practice, in company management. After a clearly defined process of selecting the appropriate scientific outcomes, these studies are explored and conclusions are made. A total of 31 publications fulfilled the criteria.

In this way, a software management system for customer relationship management was developed, as well as integration with Nova Poshta. After the introduction of the CRM system, the company identified a number of key points. Negative conversion from customers has grown. This is largely due to automation of the business process, which allowed managers to concentrate more on customer interaction. The company’s total turnover has increased. The training cycle for new staff has decreased. Also, the time taken to collect and send the parcel was considerably reduced by integrating with the Nova Poshta.

Finally, we use the TF-IDF weighting method to improve the dialog. Experimental results show that the proposed method can communicate with humans and answer real-time questions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Chatbot; LSTM; NLP; TF-IDF","Classification (of information); Natural language processing systems; Signal processing; Business promotions; Chatbot; Commercial development; LSTM; NAtural language processing; Retrieval models; TF-IDF; TF-IDF weighting; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068370452

The COSS supports operator decision making during abnormal events by making use of an online fault-diagnostic system known as PRO-AID. PRO-AID uses existing sensors and confluence equations to detect system faults before plant threshold alarms would alert operators. In a full-scope, full-scale nuclear power plant simulator we demonstrated that early diagnosis in conjunction with computer-based-procedures can assist operators in mitigating faults in circumstances that would normally lead to shutting down the plant. Here we conceive of a computerized plant management system (CPMS) that would complement COSS. COSS is intended to aid in the short-time scale operations of a plant. The CPMS is aimed at supporting longer time-scale activities involving maintenance, calibration, and early warning fault detection. Digitization allows staff to manage and monitor assets remotely without being physically present locally at the equipment under surveillance. This allows for specialization by equipment and systems rather than location. Cyber-physical systems and the industrial internet of things have no shortage of possibilities and promises, but often the benefits come with conflicting considerations: availability may tradeoff with increased cyber risk, increased redundancy may come at the cost of increased complexity, outsourcing engineering requires more communication across organizations and the associated administrative burden. In too many instances, humans tend to fill the gaps between what automation cannot reliably or cost-effectively accomplish. Human-centered design using human factors considers the role of the human as part of a human-machine-system. Our COSS concept examined how a control system, a diagnostic system, expert guidance system, and computer-based procedure system could work in concert to aid operator actions. Here we examine the potential for human factors and human-centered design for whole plant management using a CPMS. A CPMS could serve several valuable functions from providing computerized procedures for field operations to using prognostics for early failure detection, or managing information flows from sensors to business networks, system engineers, cyber-security personnel, and third-party vendors. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computerized Operator Support Systems (COSS); Control room; Nuclear human factors; Nuclear power; Process control","Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Control rooms (power plants); Cost engineering; Decision making; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Human engineering; Network security; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Outsourcing; Plant management; Process control; Systems engineering; Time measurement; Administrative burdens; Computer-based procedure; Early failure detection; Fault diagnostic systems; Human-centered designs; Operator support system; Outsourcing engineering; Power plant simulator; Computer control systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067650176

The results of quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that the acceptance of each future energy business model is relatively high. The overall usefulness was rated higher for future business models than the current business model. Prosumers had a more positive attitude towards the Peer-to-Peer model, whereas consumers preferred models in which the effort is low (DSO controlled) or an incentive is offered (Voltage-Tariff).

According to this typology, countries are subdivided into groups with a factor-driven economy, an efficiency-driven economy and an innovation-driven economy. We also consider indicators of entrepreneurial activity in various countries: the level of activity of emerging entrepreneurs; activity level of new business owners; total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA); the level of activity of established entrepreneurs; the level of exit from the business. We also consider the reasons for going out of business, the key ones being: business unprofitability, and this indicator is the main one both in the Russian Federation and in countries with an innovation-driven economy and a factor-driven economy. Along with these reasons, we can also add the following: the possibility of another employment as an employee, various personal reasons, pre-planned exit from business, lack of access to financing business, some element of chance, the possibility of selling the business, and the presence of bureaucracy and tax burden. The article analyzes the state of entrepreneurship in general by a number of indicators, including the ratio of early entrepreneurs (emerging entrepreneurs and owners of new businesses) and established entrepreneurs.

Different product-level EOL business strategies and component-level recovery options are suggested in this recovery decision support system. Then, multi-objective optimization models are formulated to identify the age-dependent recovery roadmap that best matches the product condition and meets the business goals.
