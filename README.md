# BDS M2 Exam

## Business Data Science - Module 2 - Exam

This project was completed after module 2 on the Data Science programme. The project included an in-depth analysis of research papers published within the field of “Artificial Intelligence in Business”.

During the project we employed NLP to perform topic modelling on the papers, which enabled us to identify various themes within the field of artificial intelligence in business.

Hereafter, we performed an author network analysis, which provided us with insights into the collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing practices in the field. We also developed a classification model to classify papers into topics based on their abstracts.

In summary, the outcomes of the project provided valuable insights into the field of artificial intelligence in business and could inform future research directions.
